1
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Get out where I can see you

2
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,000
No problem

3
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,000
Sir there's no need for violence.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I mean, can't we just talk about this

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Talk, this ain't no social call

6
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,000
This here's a robbery

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,729
Of course but the problem is I don't have money and I don't have much in the way of valuables either

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Oh yeah what's the wagon for then boy

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's just it's..

10
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm afraid I've run into tough times

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How..

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
How can you have nothing?

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've run into dead people with more than you

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You better not be holding out on me

15
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,000
No look, I'm a dentist.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,500
I thought I could make it out here but the problem is.

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,000
No one cares  about their teeth.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,500
They'd rather spend all their time in a saloon, or robbing people.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,560
So I'm just trying to get
somewhere where I can finally get the

20
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,900
Respect I deserve, I'm broke, ruined

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,500
These for fixing teeth

22
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Yes, but they're not worth anything to you

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If I could keep the tools then perhaps I could help you with you tooth?

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Shut up

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Excuse me but you cannot work on your own teeth

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
you need someone to do it properly or you
could end up in even worse pain

27
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:27,000
you won't find anyone else out here to fix
it

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,200
But go ahead, try yourself

29
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
Do it

30
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,200
I'll get the chair

31
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,000
Ahh

32
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,000
It's infected

33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,400
We're going to have to pull it, cause if we don't..

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,000
Just get it over with

35
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,300
Right

36
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,200
this is going to hurt

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,900
Ahhh

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,900
(crack)

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
(groaning in pain)

40
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,000
(crack)

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
(moaning in pain)

42
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,000
Do not move or I will shoot

43
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,740
I will do it

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
(dark music)

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
(somber piano music)
