1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,680
So yesterday morning, I'm running a
bit late, I grab a piece of toast and

2
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,760
head out to my car, but my car won't
start. So I have to take the bus.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,280
Now, let me pause me right there.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,320
Did you notice anything unusual
grammatically about what she,

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,800
I just said?
When did all this happen?

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,160
So yesterday morning.
I'm running a bit late . 

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,640
Yesterday morning.
So it's past, right?

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,920
OK, so listen again. How many
past verb forms can you hear?

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,240
 

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:51,040
 
 

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Thank you, Joanne.
Right, let's look at the score.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,520
Now would you look at that:

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,040
zero, nil, nothing,
zilch, nought.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,400
I think we can agree that
this did happen in the past.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,960
So how is it that Joanne
didn't use any past forms?

16
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:19,040
Did I, she make a mistake?
Well, surprisingly, no.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,440
Let me explain how it's
possible to use the present

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,760
to talk about the past.
We call it the historical present,

19
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,440
or it may also be called the dramatic
present or narrative present.

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,880
We use it a lot when we tell
jokes or anecdotes, for example,

21
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,720
because using present forms
to describe past actions makes

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,840
the story seem more immediate,
more engaging, more personal.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,080
We also see present forms being used
for the past a lot in news headlines,

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,760
whether read by news readers
or written in print or online.

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,160
And historians might use it to talk
about the ancient past

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
in a way to make
history more appealing.

27
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,120
 
In 1066 William the Conqueror invades

28
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,920
and thousands of new
words enter the English language.

29
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,520
Now, in all of these cases, we could
use past forms.

30
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,480
Let's get Joanne back to
tell us the story again,

31
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,040
 
only this time using past forms.

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,120
Let's have a look at the past form
score board,

33
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,840
and we've got a grand total of five.

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,440
Exactly the same events,
but using past forms.

35
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,040
It's not quite as involving, not quite as
engaging, but it is still correct.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,960
Now, I want to go back to the car.

37
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
My car won't start.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,520
Notice here that we have what might
appear to be a future form being

39
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,400
used in the present to talk about
something that happened in the past.

40
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,200
The first thing to
mention here is that

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,160
'will' is not really a future form.

42
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,000
It's a modal auxiliary and we do
use it to talk about an intention

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,280
to do something in the future,
say, for example, opening a window.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,680
It's hot. I'll open the window.

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,200
The act of opening the window
might be in the future,

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,640
but the intention to open it is in the
present, at the moment of speaking.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,920
It might seem weird, but 'will' actually
refers to present time, not future time.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,880
And believe it or not,
it's the same for would and wouldn't.

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,640
In the same way that will and
won't are not about future time,

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,400
would and wouldn't
aren't about past time.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,960
It's a bit more tricky to get
your head around that point.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,400
So I would prefer to talk about
that another time.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh look! I just use 'would' to talk about
something that hasn't happened yet.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
Hmm. An example that shows
it can't be the past.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,040
So I'm going to have to knock
off a point from our past-o-meter.

56
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,400
Before I leave you,
one more thing to make you think.

57
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,280
As we've seen,
'will' is used for an intention,

58
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
a plan, an idea to do something.
So when we say:

59
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
My car won't start!

60
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,920
Are we suggesting the car
doesn't have the will to start,

61
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,040
it has chosen not to start just to
wind us up, just to make us angry?

62
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,680
It may be we choose to give the
human quality of stubbornness to

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,800
an inanimate object as a way to
express our frustration.

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,120
Well, my car certainly is inanimate at the
moment, and that is very frustrating.
