Welcome to Black Table Talk,

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,542
the only place
on Tariq Nasheed's internet

4
00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:11,778
where we can have
an honest conversation.

5
00:00:12,245 --> 00:00:15,081
Today's topic,
"Women in the Workplace: Why?"

6
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:19,986
I'm your host, Dr. Haddassah
Olayinka Ali-Youngman, Pre-Ph.D,

7
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:22,521
and I'm about to take you
on the overground railroad to--

8
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,057
GABRIELLE UNION:
How long is this intro?

9
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:26,659
I'm sorry, I do not mean
to rush you, Queen Haddassah,

10
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,794
but Kaavia has me on a curfew.

11
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,864
See, see, see, no, no, no,
Gabrielle Union.

12
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:35,502
Black women babies are
not allowed to issue curfews.

13
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:37,871
Only our original kings
can do that.

14
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,807
You know, Supreme Rahmeek
told me to be home by three.

15
00:00:41,274 --> 00:00:44,376
Ooh, is he here?
Can he sign a headwrap for me?

16
00:00:44,476 --> 00:00:48,047
Unfortunately, no. He does not
fraternize with married women

17
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,150
except for me and all eight
of his wives.

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,386
Oh, that's very Doug Christie
of you guys.

19
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,988
Anyway, welcome to the show.

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,624
It says here now
that you're an actress,

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,793
an author, a television host,
a fashion designer,

22
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,228
-and a spokeswoman.
-Thank you.

23
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,930
Why so many jobs and how does

24
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,465
your husband deal
with this betrayal?

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,832
Betrayal? Uh. 

26
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:10,369
I think my husband appreciates
a woman--

27
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:12,204
-Oh.
-I'm sorry.

28
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:13,706
- Female. 
-Thank you.

29
00:01:13,806 --> 00:01:17,277
. that makes her own money,
is incredibly flexible

30
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:19,745
and still is able to raise
a family.

31
00:01:19,845 --> 00:01:21,113
I'm glad you said that.

32
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,249
Now, as everybody knows,
there are many factors

33
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,919
working towards the destruction
of the Black family.

34
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,122
Number one: wedge sneakers.
Number two: working women.

35
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:32,325
Aren't you at work right now?

36
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,427
(STAMMERS)
I don't get paid for this!

37
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,830
I have made no money
doing anything.

38
00:01:38,397 --> 00:01:39,998
Now Miss Gabrielle,

39
00:01:40,332 --> 00:01:42,435
let's talk
about your professional goals. 

40
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,737
-Sure!
-. with your king, Dwyane Wade.

41
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:47,607
Oh shit! Okay. Uh. 

42
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,875
How do you feel about your wife
out here working

43
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,110
like a free-range chicken?

44
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,147
I'm sure my, uh, cardboard king,

45
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:56,682
uh, would love for me to be home
a little bit more--

46
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,119
(SHUSHES)

47
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,888
Earth, let your god speak.

48
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,198
You know, my husband. 

49
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:14,767
nay, god,

50
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:20,539
you know, he just retired
from the universe of the NBA.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,008
Why would he do that?
Such a lucrative job.

52
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:25,278
You know, he's a little old
and he's--

53
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:27,179
How dare you speak about him
in that way?

54
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,382
I'm so sorry,
Cardboard Dwyane Wade.

55
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:31,217
Please continue.

56
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:34,286
But you know, I-- I have worked
my whole career.

57
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:35,321
That's the problem.

58
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,358
I'm actually fine being one of
the breadwinners in my family

59
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,593
Breadwinners?! Oh no!

60
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,195
White people got you thinking
bread is a prize!

61
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:45,631
Sister, may I call you Oshun?

62
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:47,099
As long as I can have
my hand back.

63
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,934
Oshun, this is not your fault.

64
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:52,271
Like Lauryn Hill, you've been
miseducated and you're late

65
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:54,674
to the true knowledge.
But we can get you back.

66
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:57,810
Oh, yes, All you have to do
is enroll in my learning center.

67
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,212
Is that-- is that like a school?

68
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,315
'cause you need to leave
every child behind!

69
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,451
-(PHONE PINGS)
-Oh, I'm sorry.

70
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:12,157
Did you just send me a Venmo
request for 58,000 dollars?

71
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:14,159
And that's just
the first installment.

72
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,161
For another 700,000,

73
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,197
you can become
a Founding Pharaoh

74
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,133
of the Dr. Haddassah Institute
for Elevation,

75
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,936
Conspiratization,
Melanization and Vitamins.

76
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:28,074
Vitamins? So you want me
to be a Founding Pharaoh

77
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,543
of your pyramid scheme?
No thanks.

78
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,146
But, but, but, see, see, see,
no, no, no,

79
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,948
with your tuition,
you will also receive

80
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:38,251
the singular, sacred text

81
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,519
that will help build your mind
to the ultimate level.

82
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,856
 The Earth is Flat: And Other
 Reasons You Shouldn't Vote.

83
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:45,424
But people should vote.

84
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:48,394
Why? Cast a ballot?
Think about it:

85
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:51,597
"ballot" is just two letters
away from "bullet."

86
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:53,366
They want us
to kill our community.

87
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,835
Ma'am, this is a takeout menu.

88
00:03:57,336 --> 00:04:02,475
-But if you want to talk
empowering Black literature. 
-Yes! Yes!

89
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,977
-Literature!
-Literature! Let's do it!

90
00:04:05,311 --> 00:04:07,046
My New York Times
bestselling book,

91
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:12,285
 A Woman Who Actually Farts:
 The Freedom of Flatulence.

92
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,420
-Chapter one--
-Get it out of here!

93
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:16,155
You have disgusted me.

94
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:17,423
You never told me you
were literate.

95
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,292
This is a total abomination.

96
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,161
Until next time. This has been
 Black Table Talk.

97
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:23,963
You didn't think I could read?

98
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,231
I had hoped not.

99
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,533
Explain yourself.
How much can you read?

100
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:30,870
The whole alphabet? That's why
you only have one husband.

101
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,971
I've had a couple.

102
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:33,673
You know what?
Let's talk about that.

103
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,607
(SOBS) I shouldn't have read
in that first marriage.

104
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,309
-Thank you.
-It was a book club,

105
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,345
-Queen Haddassah.
-Oh!

106
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,415
How many books did you get
through?

107
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,384
-Dozens.
