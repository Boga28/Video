1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,387
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish

2
00:00:04,387 --> 00:00:08,321
and today we are gonna be going over eighteen

3
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:12,928
everyday conversational idioms that will help you to describe

4
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:17,107
feelings and emotions. These are really useful idioms,

5
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:20,483
ones that I use all the time to describe

6
00:00:20,483 --> 00:00:21,376
sadness,

7
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:22,563
happiness,

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,674
fear,

9
00:00:23,674 --> 00:00:25,099
disgust,

10
00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:26,169
anger

11
00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:27,624
and surprise.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,794
So that's six different emotions and for each one,

13
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:33,692
there's gonna be three idioms.

14
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:37,927
Now I've got a really fun and great little challenge for you at the

15
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:40,844
end so make sure you stick with me all the way through.

16
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:44,225
It's gonna be an emotional roller coaster. 

17
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:47,241
Have you heard that idiom before? It's a bonus one.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,705
I've added the meaning to it on the worksheet that I've created

19
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:53,392
for you. The link is down in the description.

20
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:56,924
I've got all of the idioms that we're going over today

21
00:00:56,924 --> 00:01:00,352
with the meaning and some examples to help you know

22
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:02,245
when and how to use them.

23
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:06,238
Plus there's a little mini quiz to help you put everything

24
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:08,057
that you learn into practice.

25
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,780
Are you ready to get into it?

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,928
Let's go!

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,150
Happy,

28
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:18,456
sad,

29
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:19,926
angry.

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,680
These are all really common adjectives that we can use

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,263
to talk about our feelings in English

32
00:01:26,263 --> 00:01:31,054
but so common that they can sort of feel a little dull especially if

33
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,887
they're the only adjectives that you use

34
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,581
to talk about these feelings.

35
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:40,017
But to be totally honest, these words actually describe a really

36
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,688
wide range of emotions because we can say:

37
00:01:43,782 --> 00:01:47,268
I'm really happy that I get to finish work early tonight

38
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:48,033
or

39
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:51,054
I'm really happy I just won a trip to Italy.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,057
The idioms that we're going to go through in this lesson

41
00:01:54,057 --> 00:01:57,375
will help you talk about that range of emotions

42
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:01,069
but also help to make your English more interesting,

43
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:03,638
more fun, more meaningful.

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,349
Thanks very much. Bye!

45
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:13,006
Oh my gosh, I just got the promotion at work.

46
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,991
Emma, that's fantastic!

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,236
You must be over the moon!

48
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,570
Over the moon.

49
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:23,124
Over the moon is when you are really pleased about something.

50
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:25,077
You're ecstatic. 

51
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:29,775
If you just won a trip to Italy, you would be over the moon.

52
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,675
How was your meeting?

53
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:37,145
It was great! They gave me the time off so I'm happy as Larry.

54
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:42,064
Now this one is quite an Australian expression actually,

55
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:45,016
I think, unless anyone's going to jump in and say

56
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:49,343
that they use it too but I really love this expression,

57
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,892
happy as Larry.

58
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:54,098
It's kind of got that rhyming pattern in it.

59
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,075
To be honest, we don't really know who Larry is

60
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:00,496
but we all generally agree that he's a really happy guy

61
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:03,596
so we all want to be as happy as Larry.

62
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,627
You can use it anytime you're feeling happy

63
00:03:06,627 --> 00:03:10,043
not crazy, crazy happy, not ecstatic

64
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:12,270
but just right there in the middle.

65
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,058
There's a public holiday coming up and I'm going away 

66
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:17,822
with my friends so I'm as happy as Larry.

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,220
I had no idea that I'd enjoy my new job so much.

68
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,566
I'm a very happy camper.

69
00:03:23,683 --> 00:03:28,380
So this one is kind of similar to 'happy as Larry'

70
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:33,083
a happy camper indicates that you're really content,

71
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:37,860
really satisfied rather than extremely happy

72
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,571
but interestingly,

73
00:03:39,571 --> 00:03:44,265
'happy camper' is often used in the negative form as well.

74
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,531
So for example when the company reshuffled

75
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,396
the organisation, the team

76
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,679
were not happy campers. They were unhappy.

77
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:57,044
But it's really important to note that this is an exception.

78
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:59,487
'A happy camper' can be used in the negative,

79
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:03,762
we wouldn't use the negative form with 'over the moon'

80
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:06,719
or 'happy as Larry'. We wouldn't say

81
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,318
I'm not as happy as Larry.

82
00:04:10,207 --> 00:04:11,887
For some reason. I don't know why.

83
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:15,846
So remember if you want to use an idiom to describe happiness

84
00:04:15,846 --> 00:04:18,641
you can say: over the moon,

85
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,697
happy as Larry

86
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:23,300
or that you're a happy camper.

87
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,009
Okay let's talk about some idioms for sadness.

88
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:31,633
And again, sadness can move from feeling a little down

89
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:35,607
about your day to downright awful, you know

90
00:04:35,607 --> 00:04:40,092
feeling like life is super hard, something dramatic has happened,

91
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:42,385
something awful has happened so there's some

92
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:45,069
really big extremes here. We've got to be careful about

93
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,934
how we use these idioms.

94
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,362
And our first one is a heavy heart.

95
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:55,267
With a heavy heart, he spoke at his father's funeral.

96
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:58,547
Have you ever had that feeling where it seems like

97
00:04:58,547 --> 00:05:01,991
there's something heavy on your chest, maybe it's

98
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:06,660
hard to breathe or just your heart feels heavy and that's this

99
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,122
feeling that comes through in this idiom.

100
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:13,669
It's a terrible feeling to experience and definitely

101
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,289
on the more extreme side of sadness.

102
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:20,368
Let's see if we can lift the mood a little.

103
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,472
They thought they were buying their dream house

104
00:05:24,472 --> 00:05:27,257
but another couple offered more for it.

105
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:30,290
They've both been feeling down in the dumps all week.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,708
They're really sad, they're really disappointed.

107
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:38,544
I'm a bit bummed by missing my best friend's birthday.

108
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:45,011
So this just means that you're low on energy, a little disappointed,

109
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,192
a bit sad so it's not as bad as down in the dumps

110
00:05:49,192 --> 00:05:52,308
and this one is definitely not as extreme as

111
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,091
a heavy heart, right? So it's really not appropriate to say:

112
00:05:57,091 --> 00:06:00,837
He's a bit bummed because his friend died, right?

113
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:03,651
That would sound really insensitive.

114
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:07,788
And similarly, it seems a little over the top to say:

115
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,685
It's with a heavy heart that I tell you,

116
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,478
I can't come to your birthday.

117
00:06:14,086 --> 00:06:18,051
It's quite dramatic so just be wary of

118
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:22,028
how and when it's appropriate to use these idioms.

119
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:25,738
Now our next emotion is fear

120
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:32,195
and again fear is felt in a range. There's anxious and nervous

121
00:06:32,195 --> 00:06:34,973
right through to utter terror.

122
00:06:34,973 --> 00:06:40,993
I really hope that you haven't felt utter terror too often in life.

123
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:44,655
Sometimes that can scare the living daylights out of you

124
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:48,556
so this idiom describes a terrifying feeling, it's

125
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,984
right at the top of our scale. You know when it's

126
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:56,148
3am in the morning and the phone rings randomly.

127
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,081
Something must be wrong.

128
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,259
You get worried, terrified.

129
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,630
When my brother called me at 3am,

130
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,178
it scared the living daylights out of me.

131
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:11,347
'I jumped out of my skin' is a little less severe.

132
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,946
Maybe you've just walked into a room and

133
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,797
a sibling or a friend is jumped out from behind a wall to scare you

134
00:07:19,797 --> 00:07:21,889
right? You get such a fright.

135
00:07:23,222 --> 00:07:25,282
I nearly jumped out of my skin.

136
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,080
I quite like this next idiom too, it's used to describe  

137
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,845
a feeling of unease or discomfort, nervousness.

138
00:07:41,465 --> 00:07:44,378
That sound gives me the heebie jeebies.

139
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:48,593
Say it, it's fun to say, heebie jeebies.

140
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,092
You know when all the hairs on your arms prickle and they

141
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:56,024
stand up on end, that's the heebie jeebies.

142
00:07:57,684 --> 00:08:00,297
So to talk about fear we have:

143
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:03,248
it scared the living daylights out of me.

144
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,407
I jumped out of my skin

145
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:06,595
and

146
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,773
I got the heebie jeebies.

147
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:14,249
So our next set of idioms are about the feeling of disgust,

148
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:18,652
a really strong feeling of revulsion and disapproval.

149
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:22,702
And our first disgusting idiom is

150
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,793
to make you want to vomit.

151
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,024
So this is really gross, right? It is so disgusting,

152
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:34,066
whatever this thing is is so disgusting

153
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:37,611
it makes you want to be sick, to throw up, to vomit.

154
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:42,151
The smell was so foul it made me want to vomit.

155
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,591
Okay that's not really a great image so let's move along.

156
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,866
Actually, this next one is not much better,

157
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:51,932
it's just not quite as graphic.

158
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:55,200
Something can make your stomach turn.

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,012
I can't watch those medical shows that show you close-ups of

160
00:08:59,012 --> 00:09:03,067
knee and hip surgeries in the middle of an operation.

161
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:05,234
They make my stomach turn.

162
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:11,901
The thought of it sends you these feelings that your stomach

163
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:14,733
sort of is twisting and turning and upside down

164
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,821
and you feel a little ill.

165
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,879
No thank you. I don't like that one either.

166
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,984
Not quite as graphic as the last one but still not a pleasant feeling.

167
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:31,139
Okay to make your skin crawl.

168
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,693
This one would also fit into the fear category I think

169
00:09:34,693 --> 00:09:36,612
because it's that similar,

170
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,316
uneasy uncomfortable feeling that you get.

171
00:09:40,503 --> 00:09:44,471
I remember watching a documentary on Netflix last year

172
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:48,835
when they showed the picture of a serial killer and honestly

173
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,486
he looked so scary, he made my skin crawl.

174
00:09:54,234 --> 00:09:59,788
If you have a phobia of insects or leeches like me,

175
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:04,978
spiders and bugs and things, they might make your skin crawl.

176
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:09,295
The thought of spiders and snakes makes your skin crawl.

177
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,919
All right let's leave disgust behind

178
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,304
and move on to the next emotion

179
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:17,606
anger.

180
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,397
My neighbour had just got a new car,

181
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:24,909
he pulled up onto the street out the front of our house

182
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:28,573
and then got out to admire it and out of nowhere

183
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:30,854
someone hit the back of the car.

184
00:10:31,977 --> 00:10:32,923
Oh my gosh,

185
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,285
he flew off the handle.

186
00:10:35,612 --> 00:10:40,477
So this expression is used to describe someone who's really angry.

187
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:44,891
If anyone is in this state, it's best to stay out of their way right?

188
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:47,280
He flew off the handle when someone

189
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,213
rammed into his car.

190
00:10:49,704 --> 00:10:54,046
Now keep in mind, it's not he flew off his handle,

191
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:56,803
flew off the handle, okay?

192
00:10:56,803 --> 00:11:01,211
To be 'up in arms about something' it also describes

193
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:05,762
feeling really angry but it's less aggressive than

194
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:09,796
to 'fly off the handle'. Sounds less aggressive, right?

195
00:11:09,796 --> 00:11:12,932
You think about throwing your arms up in the air, we do this

196
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:16,073
when we're frustrated, we're annoyed about something,

197
00:11:16,073 --> 00:11:17,358
we're irritated.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,416
So there's a difference, right? 'Flying off the handle' is really angry

199
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,861
but we can say she was up in arms about how messy the shared

200
00:11:26,861 --> 00:11:28,065
kitchen was.

201
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,724
And lastly

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,516
I'm at the end of my tether.

203
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,848
If you've got young kids

204
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:38,634
then this could be a really useful idiom for you.

205
00:11:38,634 --> 00:11:41,818
Imagine that moment when your kids have been really naughty,

206
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:45,254
really disobedient all day. You've been asking them to

207
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,980
tidy their room, clean up all their toys all afternoon

208
00:11:50,354 --> 00:11:51,654
and they're not doing it

209
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,943
and you keep hearing them yelling and screaming.

210
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:58,651
It's driving you nuts, right? And then

211
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,019
A ball breaks through the kitchen window.

212
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:03,857
And you yell at them.

213
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,858
I'm at the end of my tether with you!

214
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,493
meaning you've pushed me to my limit. I'm at the end of my ability

215
00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:16,777
to be patient with you, I've had enough.

216
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:20,550
Cool so now you've got three idioms to use

217
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,291
if someone is driving you crazy.

218
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,870
Another idiom

219
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,076
or maybe someone is making you really angry or annoyed or

220
00:12:29,076 --> 00:12:32,236
even if you're thinking about describing a situation

221
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:33,518
where you felt that way,

222
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,273
use these idioms to add flavour and colour to the way

223
00:12:38,273 --> 00:12:40,384
that you're describing that situation.

224
00:12:40,945 --> 00:12:42,873
Couldn't you believe that?

225
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,362
I had to do a double-take there.

226
00:12:45,362 --> 00:12:48,481
We've already been through fifteen idioms together.

227
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,065
Time flies when you're having fun.

228
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,761
Before we get into our last emotion,

229
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:57,245
let me know what you think about this video. Are you enjoying it?

230
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:01,236
Hit that subscribe button, give it a like, all of these things help me

231
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:05,800
to know what lessons you really want to see here at mmmEnglish.

232
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,571
That came out of the blue.

233
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:16,650
I hope it didn't stop you dead in your tracks.

234
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:22,065
I've already used all three idioms that I'm going to go through now.

235
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:24,216
I wonder if you picked up on any of them?

236
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:28,897
To do a double-take is to look again at something really quickly

237
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,654
like you see it and then you go back to normal

238
00:13:32,654 --> 00:13:35,620
and then you suddenly think oh my gosh what was that?

239
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,087
It's surprise, right? It's caught you by surprise

240
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:41,947
and we often use it with the verb do.

241
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:44,617
I did a double-take. I couldn't believe it

242
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:47,906
and when something comes at you from out of the blue

243
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:52,266
it's like it came from nowhere, it was completely unexpected.

244
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,825
They got married just a few weeks after meeting,

245
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,949
it was completely out of the blue.

246
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,305
Now this one is almost quite literal, it's when you suddenly

247
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:05,556
stop moving because you're so surprised by something.

248
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:10,033
She stopped dead in her tracks when she saw Maria.

249
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:12,628
She hadn't seen her in over twenty years.

250
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:17,325
So all of these idioms helped to express shock or surprise

251
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:21,722
in some way. They're really great to add to stories and to make

252
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:25,456
your English more interesting and exciting, right?

253
00:14:25,456 --> 00:14:29,232
I stopped dead in my tracks. I couldn't believe it was her.

254
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:31,438
It came out of the blue.

255
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:35,046
Okay so we've been through all of those different idioms.

256
00:14:35,046 --> 00:14:39,081
Now I've got a little challenge for you to help you put into practice 

257
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:40,482
what you've been learning 

258
00:14:40,482 --> 00:14:44,420
so get your fingers ready to type. I want you to share a little

259
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,014
story with me down in the comments.

260
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,688
Take me on an emotional roller coaster.

261
00:14:50,922 --> 00:14:54,224
Tell me a story, maybe one that you've experienced,

262
00:14:54,224 --> 00:14:58,720
maybe it's a fictional one that you make up but tell me a story

263
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,488
where the emotions go up, go down, go up and go down

264
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:07,102
and try to use one of the idioms from each section

265
00:15:07,102 --> 00:15:08,413
of this video.

266
00:15:08,413 --> 00:15:11,830
And don't forget to download the free workbook that I've created

267
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,807
for you, it's got all of the idioms from this lesson,

268
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:19,638
their meanings, example sentences as well as a bonus little quiz

269
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:22,200
to help you test what you learned.

270
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,796
I'm super excited about my next video coming out

271
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:26,798
on the mmmEnglish Channel.

272
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:29,520
I hope to see you in there. Bye for now!
