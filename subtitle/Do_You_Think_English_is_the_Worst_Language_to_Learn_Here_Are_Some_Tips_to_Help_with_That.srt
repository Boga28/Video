1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,550
The more I teach English on YouTube,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,350
the more I realize how
difficult it must be for you

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,960
to learn this language.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,270
There are so many strange and
weird things about English

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,540
that must be really hard to understand.

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,910
So in this English lesson,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,990
I'll talk about some of those things.

8
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,270
And at the end, I'll give
you a piece of advice.

9
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,130
I'll let you know one or
two things that you can do

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,440
that will help you learn this
fun, crazy, weird language

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,691
we call English.

12
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,274
(upbeat music)

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,880
So, is English the worst
language in the world to learn?

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,713
I'm not sure.

15
00:00:35,713 --> 00:00:37,140
I know if I was learning English,

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,140
the number one thing that
I would be annoyed with

17
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,320
would be phrasal verbs.

18
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,520
Phrasal verbs are these weird verbs

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,890
where we add a preposition or an adverb

20
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,800
or a preposition and an adverb,

21
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,260
and then the verb means
something completely different.

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,790
You can't even look at a phrasal verb

23
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,280
and know exactly what
it means all the time.

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,700
Sometimes it's a mystery
and you have to look it up.

25
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,710
It's when we have verbs like to give up,

26
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,890
which mean to quit doing something

27
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,510
or verbs like to run out of,

28
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,760
which means that you have
no more of something.

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,660
They're just weird.

30
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,800
They're difficult.

31
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,770
English speakers use them all the time.

32
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,650
Sometimes people learning English

33
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,540
think they don't need to learn
them, but you definitely do.

34
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,920
I use phrasal verbs all day long.

35
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,350
And if I was learning English,

36
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,440
I think it would drive me crazy

37
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,450
learning all these phrasal verbs.

38
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,120
And then of course there are
contractions and reductions.

39
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,010
Contractions are when we
take a phrase like I do not

40
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,350
and we shorten it to I don't.

41
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,430
A reduction is when we take
a phrase like I want to,

42
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,870
and we shorten it to say I wanna.

43
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,500
It's when we take a
phrase like I am going to

44
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,730
and we shorten it to I'm gonna.

45
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,200
For some reason, English
speakers always seem

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,620
to be in a hurry.

47
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,360
That's why a sentence like how is it going

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,050
actually sounds like this
when a speaker says it

49
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,020
at full speed, how's it goin'?

50
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,320
It doesn't really resemble hardly at all

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,360
the original sentence, how is it going?

52
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,650
But contractions and reductions,

53
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,450
another interesting part
of the English language.

54
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,500
Another slightly frustrating thing

55
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,560
about the English language

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,650
is that spelling does not
always equal pronunciation.

57
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,930
I have an extension cord here

58
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,130
and I'm going to wind
up this extension cord.

59
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,300
If you look behind me,

60
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,410
you can see that there
is a bit of wind today.

61
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,450
Wind and wind are spelled
exactly the same way,

62
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,350
but they have two
different pronunciations.

63
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,640
Every Friday, I do a live English lesson

64
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,660
and I live on a farm.

65
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,710
Live and live are spelled
exactly the same way

66
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,040
and they have different pronunciations.

67
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,740
So again, I'm probably apologizing
too much in this video,

68
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,610
but I apologize for that
weirdness of the English language.

69
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,840
Sometimes, the way a word is spelled

70
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,640
doesn't let you know exactly
how you should pronounce it.

71
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,970
And then of course there's idioms.

72
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,780
Idioms are like little
word stories that we use

73
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,250
to describe certain situations.

74
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,960
When we do something that's really easy,

75
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,980
we might say that it's a piece of cake.

76
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,360
And as an English learner,

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,670
you must wonder how does that phrase mean

78
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,780
that something's easy

79
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,450
when I say something's a piece of cake?

80
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,540
But it does.

81
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,680
When we're feeling sick,

82
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,190
we might say that we're
feeling under the weather.

83
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,350
And as an English learner,

84
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:13,497
once again, you must think,

85
00:03:13,497 --> 00:03:16,710
"What? How did that phrase ever mean

86
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,770
that someone is feeling
a little bit sick?"

87
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:22,280
So idioms, another crazy
part of this language,

88
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,240
but we do use them.

89
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,640
In fact, we use them a lot.

90
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,750
So you do need to learn them.

91
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,440
One of the other joys
of the English language

92
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,340
is that we make rules and
then we make a whole bunch

93
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,120
of exceptions to the rules.

94
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,750
We make rules about how
the language should work.

95
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,470
And then we make other little
adjustments to the rule.

96
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,930
We say things like this.

97
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,030
There was one house and
there were two houses.

98
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,230
There was one mouse.

99
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,540
There were two mice.

100
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,800
Why is the plural of house, houses

101
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,300
and the plural of mouse, mice?

102
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,190
It doesn't seem to make sense.

103
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,070
So one of the other joys,

104
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,450
I use air quotes because it
means I'm being sarcastic.

105
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:59,340
I don't think it's actually a joy.

106
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,720
One of the joys of the English language,

107
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,930
we make rules and then we make exceptions.

108
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,190
And native speakers
also do something else.

109
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,860
Sometimes they break the rules
and you don't even know why.

110
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,100
So what is the solution?

111
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,950
What advice can I give you

112
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,410
to help you learn this
crazy, weird language

113
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,570
we call English?

114
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,480
Well, there's two pieces of
advice that I would give.

115
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,750
The first thing that I recommend you do

116
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,250
is that you spend lots
of time getting input.

117
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,810
I do highly recommend
that people read and write

118
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,030
and listen and speak.

119
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,830
I feel like you should be
doing lots of all four,

120
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,350
but when you want to learn
about the strange idiosyncrasies

121
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,183
about the language,

122
00:04:37,183 --> 00:04:39,640
the strange little
things about the language

123
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,610
that you can't figure out
from a textbook or a book,

124
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,590
you should do lots of listening

125
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,660
and you should do lots of reading.

126
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,070
Listen to music, watch
TV shows, read books.

127
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,870
The more input you get,

128
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,160
the more you expose yourself
to these weird, little parts

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,470
of the English language,

130
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,840
the more your brain will remember them.

131
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,740
The second piece of advice
I will give you is this.

132
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,500
You should have an English tutor.

133
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,330
I know that seems obvious,

134
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,720
but you should have a person
who speaks the English language

135
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,460
that you can go to when
you have a question

136
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,800
about some of these
weird and strange things.

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,900
So those are the two pieces
of advice I would give you

138
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,730
in order to become really good at learning

139
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,950
the weird and strange aspects
of the English language.

140
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,290
Immerse yourself in it as much as you can.

141
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,450
Get lots of input.

142
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,600
And find someone who can
actually answer your questions

143
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,890
when you run into one of these
strange little situations.

144
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:36,260
Well, thanks for taking the time

145
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,370
to watch this little English lesson.

146
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,730
I hope the two pieces of
advice that I gave you

147
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,800
will help you a lot as you
continue to learn this language.

148
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,200
And remember, if this
is your first time here,

149
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,280

And if this video helped
you learn a bit of English,

151
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,960
please give me a thumbs up.

152
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,590
And if you have some extra time,

153
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,052
why don't you stick around and
watch another English lesson?

154
00:05:57,052 --> 00:05:59,635
(upbeat music)
