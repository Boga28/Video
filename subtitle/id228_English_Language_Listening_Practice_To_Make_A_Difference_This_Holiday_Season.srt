1
00:00:01,163 --> 00:00:02,003
Hi there.

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:05,813
Today, let's talk about
'Charity at Christmas'.

3
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:08,240
I'll explain the vocabulary as well  here.

4
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:12,142
Let's talk about 'Charity at
Christmas' and something that's

5
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:14,752
more of a social issue in the UK.

6
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:20,582
One of the things that people in the UK
sometimes do at Christmas, they volunteer.

7
00:00:21,302 --> 00:00:25,652
Or they make charitable
donations, donations to charity.

8
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,460
The idea is that even with our cost of
living crisis, most of us are warm and

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,957
comfortable and have enough to eat.

10
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:39,427
So it's a time to think of
people for whom this isn't true.

11
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:42,157
Time to think about people
who don't have those things.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,430
Christmas is often seen as a time
where people give something back.

13
00:00:46,542 --> 00:00:49,962
They do something to make a
difference, a positive difference

14
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,162
in other people's lives.

15
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,060
So, which charities do people in the
UK think of particularly at Christmas?

16
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,750
Listen to this podcast to find out!

17
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:24,341
One of the issues that's
foremost in people's minds around

18
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:27,251
Christmas time is homelessness.

19
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:35,617
' Homeless', H O M E L E S S is an
adjective, and that's used to describe

20
00:01:35,622 --> 00:01:37,587
someone who doesn't have a home.

21
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,257
And 'homelessness'?

22
00:01:40,437 --> 00:01:44,877
So H O M E L E S S N E S S.

23
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:48,717
That's just the noun associated with this.

24
00:01:48,835 --> 00:01:52,649
So we would say 'Homelessness
is a problem in the UK'.

25
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:57,602
If you haven't visited the UK, you
might think, 'Well, it's a rich country.

26
00:01:57,932 --> 00:02:02,432
Why are there homeless people?' You
may not be aware that homelessness

27
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:05,072
is a problem in the UK - but it is.

28
00:02:05,204 --> 00:02:10,964
There are lots of homeless people in
London, or we might say 'homelessness

29
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:13,614
is a big problem in a city like London'.

30
00:02:14,063 --> 00:02:17,993
So one of the things that people often
do at Christmas is they volunteer

31
00:02:18,203 --> 00:02:24,473
to work for a couple of days at a
homeless organisation or charity.

32
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,015
Vocabulary here?

33
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:29,765
The word 'charity', C H A R I T Y.

34
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:32,154
Well, it's an idea, a concept.

35
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:37,144
It means 'giving, being generous,
being helpful, usually to people

36
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:39,214
less fortunate than yourself'.

37
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:41,734
That's the idea of 'charity'.

38
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:48,259
But we also  use that noun  as a word for
organisations  that do charitable work.

39
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:53,811
So, examples that you've probably heard
of would be Oxfam, the Red Cross, or

40
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:57,261
the WWF, the Worldwide Fund for Nature.

41
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:01,661
They're 'charities' or
'charitable organisations'.

42
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:06,827
The noun 'volunteer', V O L U N T E E R.

43
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,081
And the verb 'to volunteer', same
spelling - it means you 'offer your

44
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:18,505
time, your skills, your energy, and
you agree to work for free to help

45
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:20,545
towards a particular goal or purpose'.

46
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:26,076
One of the things that people in the
UK sometimes do around Christmas, they

47
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:29,646
volunteer for the homeless shelters.

48
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:33,181
The word 'shelter', S H E L T E R.

49
00:03:33,451 --> 00:03:39,271
You might talk about 'an animal shelter'
in a field or a 'bus shelter' on a

50
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:42,991
street where you're protected from
the rain while you wait for your bus.

51
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:48,358
We might also use it in the context
of a 'bomb shelter' as well, where

52
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,948
you're protected safe from bombs.

53
00:03:51,173 --> 00:03:55,913
So 'to shelter' means to find
somewhere safe and a bit protected.

54
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:58,803
Some statistics on homelessness?

55
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:03,194
These are from the Ashley Foundation,
which is a homeless charity that

56
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,164
operates in some northern towns,
Blackpool, Blackburn, and Sunderland.

57
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:13,833
The Ashley Foundation, they estimate
that in the UK there are around

58
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,362
9,000 people  who 'sleep rough'.

59
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:20,182
'Rough sleeping' is
another term that we use.

60
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:22,885
That means they're living on the streets.

61
00:04:22,885 --> 00:04:25,915
They're sleeping without
being in a bed or a building.

62
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:28,075
They're perhaps in a doorway somewhere.

63
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:29,681
That's 'rough sleeping'.

64
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:32,858
Just thinking a moment
about the weather in the UK.

65
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:37,025
I know that there are plenty of places
that are colder than the UK, but right

66
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,185
now the range of temperatures for today?

67
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:45,148
So it's cold outside,  minus four degrees
centigrade to plus two degrees centigrade.

68
00:04:45,438 --> 00:04:49,008
Not great, if you're outdoors, you
don't have much to eat and you don't

69
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:51,258
have anywhere where you can get warm.

70
00:04:51,543 --> 00:04:55,743
And you may not actually see
homeless people in the UK.

71
00:04:56,055 --> 00:05:00,825
Often  what they'll do is ride on
buses or on trains for the day.

72
00:05:01,185 --> 00:05:04,185
They get a seat and at
least it's warm on there.

73
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,637
That's better than being outside all day.

74
00:05:06,765 --> 00:05:11,895
But many homeless people also sleep
in tents pitched on pavements.

75
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:17,625
That figure of 9,000 is the
estimate of the Ashley Foundation

76
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:22,875
for the number of 'rough sleepers'
last Christmas, Christmas 2021.

77
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:26,223
They think that this year the
number will be somewhat higher.

78
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:32,845
The Ashley Foundation also quotes research
done by Heriot-Watt University in the UK.

79
00:05:33,494 --> 00:05:38,924
This research says that homeless
people are 17 times more likely to be

80
00:05:39,194 --> 00:05:44,564
physically attacked on the street than
somebody that has a home to go to.

81
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,809
Homeless people are very
vulnerable health-wise.

82
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:53,614
Being out in the cold, rough sleeping,
not attending to their healthcare needs.

83
00:05:53,614 --> 00:05:55,504
This is all part of it.

84
00:05:55,843 --> 00:06:00,170
It's generally not good for your physical
health, and it tends to mean that homeless

85
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,510
people have shorter life expectancy.

86
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:06,065
They can't expect to live as
long as the rest of us do.

87
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:10,729
Homeless people are also vulnerable
mental health wise - that means 'the

88
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:12,709
health of your mind, your psychology'.

89
00:06:12,994 --> 00:06:16,174
It's not good for you psychologically
to live on the street.

90
00:06:16,718 --> 00:06:23,138
It feels fairly hopeless and quite
often it is mental health problems that

91
00:06:23,438 --> 00:06:28,718
cause people or are part of the cause of
people being homeless in the first place.

92
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,830
But of course, having nowhere to
live doesn't help your mental health.

93
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:37,156
As I said, you might be really
surprised to find that a country like

94
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:40,396
the UK has a big homelessness problem.

95
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,410
How and why does it happen?

96
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:45,184
Often it's a series of difficulties.

97
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:49,924
Someone might lose their job
or a relationship might end.

98
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:53,864
They may find themselves unable
to pay the rent or their mortgage

99
00:06:53,869 --> 00:06:56,494
anymore, so they may lose their house.

100
00:06:56,974 --> 00:07:02,284
Perhaps they sleep on a friend's sofa
for a while, but after a bit this isn't

101
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:07,594
a good arrangement anymore and bit by
bit, they move towards homelessness

102
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:10,175
- eventually they end up homeless.

103
00:07:10,345 --> 00:07:15,349
Often people who're homeless have
drug or alcohol addiction problems.

104
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:21,055
Quite commonly, homeless people have lost
the support of their family and friends.

105
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:27,875
It might be teenagers,  young people
who have run away from home because it's

106
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,795
not a good environment there for them.

107
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:32,005
They sometimes end up being homeless.

108
00:07:32,678 --> 00:07:36,968
Housing is expensive in the
UK and theoretically the state

109
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:39,398
will provide housing for people.

110
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:43,568
The trouble is there are
long waiting lists, and this

111
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:45,068
doesn't happen very quickly.

112
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:47,329
Another reason for homelessness?

113
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,579
People sometimes come to the UK
as migrants from other countries.

114
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,402
They may not have a plan in place.

115
00:07:55,545 --> 00:08:00,045
Not everyone can get a job or
settle into UK life very easily.

116
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:04,159
So homelessness can happen
for a number of reasons.

117
00:08:04,471 --> 00:08:10,231
And once you're homeless, once you have
no fixed address, no regular access to

118
00:08:10,411 --> 00:08:17,886
technology or electricity even, no means
of receiving mail or email, you become

119
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:23,426
'outside of the system' and it's a process
that's quite difficult to turn around.

120
00:08:23,624 --> 00:08:26,444
So how can you help
people in this situation?

121
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:33,244
Well, the Ashley Foundation suggest first
of all, giving your old coats or jackets,

122
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,974
especially warm ones, to the charity.

123
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:38,631
They also suggest making a donation.

124
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,801
That means 'giving money'.

125
00:08:40,013 --> 00:08:43,398
Or  you can volunteer at one
of their homeless shelters.

126
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:47,349
Another good thing that the
Ashley Foundation do - they

127
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:50,589
run an app called Street Link.

128
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:56,339
You can download this app to your
phone and on the app you can alert the

129
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,619
local authorities to a homeless person
that you have seen, rough sleeping.

130
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,920
When I say 'alert the authorities'
that means in order to get them help.

131
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:10,252
And this may result in the homeless
person being offered ' temporary

132
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:14,982
accommodation', so being offered
somewhere to sleep for a short time.

133
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:18,915
It also may mean that they
can access healthcare as well,

134
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:20,747
see a doctor if necessary.

135
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:23,163
So that app sounds a really good idea.

136
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,280
Even getting someone a bed for
the night, even something that

137
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,470
short term can be really helpful.

138
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:34,858
So if you're in the UK, and if you want
to volunteer and give your time to help

139
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:41,021
homeless people, then Crisis UK  is the
best known national organisation for this.

140
00:09:41,291 --> 00:09:45,671
The Ashley Foundation is great,
but it tends to operate just in

141
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:50,986
those northern towns, Blackpool,
Blackburn, and Sunderland - that's

142
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:52,516
where they seem to operate.

143
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:57,292
Crisis UK have services in the
main cities like London, Edinburgh,

144
00:09:57,322 --> 00:10:00,092
Coventry, Swansea, Oxford etc.

145
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:04,877
I realise that most people listening to
this podcast are not based in the UK,

146
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:10,407
but it could be that there is a problem
with homelessness in your country.

147
00:10:11,057 --> 00:10:15,062
And there are plenty of
international organisations that

148
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:19,600
you could  volunteer with  that help
homeless people across the world.

149
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,960
And of course volunteering and donations
are always welcome through international

150
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,940
organisations which help people in
countries like Ukraine and Syria.

151
00:10:30,227 --> 00:10:33,875
OK, so that's 'Charity at Christmas'.

152
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:38,101
Let me wish you a very happy
Christmas and let's look forward

153
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:41,281
to 2023 and hope it's a great year.

154
00:10:41,346 --> 00:10:42,336
All the best!

155
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:43,536
Enough for now.

156
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:44,646
Have a lovely day.

157
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:45,876
Speak to you again soon.

158
00:10:46,116 --> 00:10:46,566
Goodbye.
