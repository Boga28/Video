00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,610
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:07,240
Can you explain that a little bit more?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,780
Let's talk about it.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,109
Whether you're explaining how to do something
or you're explaining your thoughts, it's important

5
00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:18,380
to have the right words.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,340
So today I'd like to help you learn 14 phrases
for explaining in English.

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,939
Sometimes my mother-in-law will spend the
night at my house so that my husband, Dan,

8
00:00:27,939 --> 00:00:30,140
and I can go out on a date.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,930
If you've ever helped a two year old settle
down at the end of the night and sleep, it

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,170
can be a long process.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,320
He has to take a bath, and brush his teeth,
and then go into the room and play with his

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,500
animals, and tell some stories, sing some
songs.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,890
It's a long process, at least for my two year
old, but it's worth it because he sleeps from

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,170
8:00 PM to 8:00 AM, very peacefully.

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,490
So all of that work is worth it.

16
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,880
But when we're explaining this to her, we
need to explain these steps, and how to do

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,780
it so that it's easier for her.

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,220
And so that my two year old will actually
calm down and rest at the end of the day.

19
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,420
In the first section of this lesson, you're
going to be learning phrases for explaining

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,530
a process, how to do something.

21
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:20,210
And then in the second half, you're going
to learn phrases for explaining your thoughts,

22
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,820
which is different, but we'll get to that
a little bit later.

23
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,190
Let's start with the first section.

24
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,010
How to explain a process.

25
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:32,100
To start off with, try to have dinner between
six and seven PM.

26
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,690
This is a great phrasal verb, to start off
with.

27
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:41,140
You can also drop the word with, and just
say, "To start off, try to have dinner between

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,100
six and 7:00 PM."

29
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,980
First, second, third, fourth, fifth.

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,950
These are called ordinal numbers, because
you are ordering something.

31
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,890
First, take a bath directly after dinner.

32
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,360
Second, brush his teeth.

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,930
Third, go into the bedroom right after he
brushes his teeth.

34
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,049
You can use ordinal numbers for really any
number.

35
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:14,959
112th, 389th, but it gets a little bit excessive
and overwhelming to label things like that.

36
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,100
Generally we try to keep things under five,
especially in a spoken list.

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,920
This isn't a rule, but I feel like if you
start saying fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth,

38
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,910
ninth, 10th, 11th, 12th, it gets a little
bit overwhelming.

39
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,510
So if you're going to use ordinal numbers,
this is just my general recommendation.

40
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,020
Try to keep it at first, second, third, fourth,
fifth.

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,330
If your list gets above fifth, you can use
some of the next expressions.

42
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,330
Next.

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:47,530
Next, he'll probably want to play with his
stuffed animals in his room with you.

44
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,530
Then.

45
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:53,810
Then, ask him if he wants you to read a book
or to tell him a story.

46
00:02:53,810 --> 00:03:01,450
Once you've done that, or once you've finished
that, once you've done that, turn off the

47
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,520
light, sit beside his bed and tell him about
his day.

48
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,459
I've never heard of a small child wanting
to do this for comfort, but my two year old

49
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,950
loves when we start at the beginning of the
day and say, this morning when you woke up

50
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,690
we made some toast, and you just go through
the entire day.

51
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,800
It kind of seems like it's cleansing to him,
it's really sweet.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,810
So at the end of the day, that's one of the
things that we do, is we talk about his day.

53
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,400
Lastly, or finally.

54
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,200
Lastly, leave the room and tell him that you'll
come back in, in just a moment to tell him

55
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
good night.

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,460
It's such a funny thing.

57
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,959
My husband, Dan, always puts him to bed.

58
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,910
But when Dan leaves the room, my child wants
us both to peek our head in, and just say

59
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,400
good night.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,180
And then he's quiet all night.

61
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,530
In the end.

62
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,629
In the end, he'll usually fall asleep immediately,
and then wake up around 8:00 AM in the morning.

63
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:06,060
Occasionally, he'll wake up around midnight,
get a drink of water, use the little potty

64
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,410
beside his bed, and then get back in bed,
tuck himself in, and fall back asleep all

65
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,420
by himself.

66
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,930
He's growing up.

67
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,570
Occasionally, maybe once a month, he'll cry
out in the middle of the night, and Dan will

68
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,139
go into him and comfort him.

69
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:22,699
But that's a pretty unusual situation.

70
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:28,020
Before we go on to section number two, which
is explaining or clarifying your thoughts,

71
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,490
which is different than what we just talked
about, let's review this first section.

72
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,839
You're going to really know how to put my
two year old to bed.

73
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,719
This is reviewing that process.

74
00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:42,870
So what I want you to do is, while I'm speaking,
I want you to try to follow with my voice,

75
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,379
and speak out loud with me.

76
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:48,180
This is just going to help you to remember
all of these expressions, and also it's good

77
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,229
for you to hear your own voice using English.

78
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,810
It builds confidence, and it's great for your
pronunciation.

79
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,599
All right, let's start.

80
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:01,539
To start off with, try to eat dinner sometime
between six and 7:00 PM.

81
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:04,590
First, give him a bath directly after dinner.

82
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:07,020
Second, brush his teeth.

83
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,250
Third, go into the bedroom directly.

84
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:15,169
Next, he'll probably want to play with his
stuffed animals in his room with you.

85
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:20,319
Then, ask him if he wants to read a book or
for you to tell him a story.

86
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,379
Once you've done that, turn off the light,
sit beside his bed and talk about his day.

87
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:32,120
Lastly, leave the room and tell him that you'll
peek your head in the door to say good night.

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,719
In the end, he usually falls asleep immediately,
and will wake up around 8:00 AM.

89
00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:38,839
And there you have it.

90
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,749
Our calm, peaceful night usually starts around
8:00 PM.

91
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:48,759
Let's go on to the second section, where I
want to help you learn seven phrases for explaining

92
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:50,879
or clarifying your thoughts.

93
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,430
Have you ever said something and then realized
that the other person didn't completely understand

94
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,809
what you were trying to say?

95
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,999
Well, you need to clarify yourself.

96
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:04,659
Native speakers use these phrases a lot when
they're trying to reexplain what they said,

97
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:06,629
so I hope that you can use them as well.

98
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:07,979
Let's imagine the situation.

99
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:12,169
You're trying to meet your friend for dinner,
but you're going to be late.

100
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:15,930
Well, what are some phrases you could use?

101
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,219
What I mean is. 

102
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:20,919
You call your friend and say, "Hey, I'm so
sorry.

103
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm stuck in traffic.

104
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,629
I'm going to be late.

105
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:27,009
What I mean is, I'm going to be 30 minutes
late."

106
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:31,620
In this situation, you're clarifying directly
at that moment.

107
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,419
If you had said, just, "I'm going to be late,"
You're not really giving them any details.

108
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:41,599
So if you want to clarify at that moment,
you could say, "Hey, I'm sorry, I'm going

109
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:43,250
to be late, there's lots of traffic.

110
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,990
Oh, what I mean is, I'm going to be 30 minutes
late."

111
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,729
What I mean is .  So you're clarifying what
the word late means.

112
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:55,179
It could be five minutes, it could be two
hours.

113
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:59,889
So you want to let them know, "What I mean
is, I'm going to be 30 minutes late."

114
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,969
What if we want to use mean in the past tense?

115
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:06,190
What I meant was. 

116
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,119
When can we use, what I meant was?

117
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:13,569
Let's imagine that you're in that situation,
you're trying to meet your friend for dinner,

118
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:14,569
and you're going to be late.

119
00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,009
So you call your friend and say, "Hey, I'm
sorry.

120
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,310
Traffic is awful, I'm going to be late."

121
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,650
And that's all you say.

122
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,240
You hang up the phone.

123
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,999
And then 20 minutes later, your friend calls
you and says, "Hey, where are you?

124
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:28,530
I've been waiting for 20 minutes."

125
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:33,729
You are going to need to clarify what you
previously said, so we're going to try to

126
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,099
use the past tense here.

127
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:41,050
What I meant was, I'm going to be 30 minutes
late.

128
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,840
What I meant was. 

129
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,240
So you're realizing, oh no, I didn't give
you enough details, I'm sorry.

130
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,379
I need to go back and clarify what I said
before.

131
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:55,610
So you're explaining your previous statement,
"I'm going to be late," but you're explaining

132
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,740
it, using that past tense.

133
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:04,179
What I meant was .  So we're using meant,
which is the past tense, and was, which is

134
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:05,589
the past tense.

135
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:11,179
This is great, especially if you want the
other person to not feel so bad, and you are

136
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:16,529
thinking, "Oh, I'm so sorry, I should have
told you exactly what I meant."

137
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,810
So you can use this wonderful expression in
your daily life, in business conversations.

138
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,120
"Oh, I'm sorry.

139
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,029
What I meant was, I'm going to be 30 minutes
late."

140
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,050
Or in that same situation, your friend calls
you and says, "Hey, I've been waiting 20 minutes,

141
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,050
where are you?"

142
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:37,479
And you realize, ah, I forgot to clarify and
tell you exactly how late I was going to be,

143
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,340
especially with Google Maps these days, it's
pretty easy to know how late you're going

144
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,380
to be based on traffic.

145
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,670
So you are going to need to go back and explain,
and clarify what you originally meant.

146
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:57,531
You can say a simple phrase, "Oh, I meant
that I was going to be 30 minutes late, traffic

147
00:08:57,531 --> 00:08:58,531
is awful."

148
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:02,340
Instead of saying, "What I meant was. "

149
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,450
You're just saying, "I meant.."

150
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,990
This is the past tense.

151
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,300
You're saying, "Oh, I should have said this
before, but I didn't, so now I'm going to

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,300
say it to you."

153
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,650
Oh, I meant that I was going to be 30 minutes
late.

154
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,650
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,650
I forgot to tell you.

156
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,520
It was kind of crazy in traffic.

157
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,830
I meant that I was going to be 30 minutes
late.

158
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:21,830
Okay.

159
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,370
Are you ready to take this to the next level?

160
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:31,990
The final four phrases are used generally
in negative situations to clarify and explain

161
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:36,960
something, but each one has a slightly different
meaning, so you need to make sure that you

162
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,710
understand how other people are using it so
that you know their context, and also when

163
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,070
you use it, you need to make sure you use
it in the correct way.

164
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,750
So for each of these final four statements,
we're going to be looking at two different

165
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,750
situations.

166
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,120
One is how to use that statement in an indirect
way, and one is how to use it in a more direct

167
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
way.

168
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,140
So take a deep breath, we've talked about
a lot so far, let's talk about these final

169
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,570
four explaining phrases.

170
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,220
Let's say that your friend asks you about
your new job and your friend asks, "How's

171
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,220
the job going?

172
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,570
Is it what you thought it would be?

173
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,810
How were your coworkers?

174
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,380
What's your boss like?"

175
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,590
But unfortunately, your job isn't going that
well.

176
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:25,240
How can you clarify and explain this situation?

177
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,220
You can use our first phrase, "Let me put
it this way."

178
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:36,330
Let me put it this way, I probably should
have stayed at my old job.

179
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:41,610
In this situation you're not saying, "I hate
my new job, it's terrible."

180
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,490
You're being indirect.

181
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:47,390
You're saying something positive about your
old job.

182
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:52,790
Let me put it this way, I probably should
have stayed at my old job.

183
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:59,320
You're choosing to use a clarification or
an explanation in a positive way.

184
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,800
But can we use, "let me put it this way,"
to be even more direct?

185
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Yes.

186
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,210
Let's look at another situation.

187
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,761
If you go on a date with someone and you're
trying to explain how your date went, you

188
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:16,610
might say, "Oh yeah, the food was good, he
was nice, and kind, and handsome.

189
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,200
And he picked me up on time."

190
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,790
Well, these are all general statements.

191
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,910
How can we make this more direct and more
concise?

192
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:31,820
We can use this expression and say, "But,
let me put it this way.

193
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,010
We just didn't have a good connection."

194
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:40,290
So you're using all of these general statements,
and then you're narrowing it down to one final

195
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,150
conclusion, "Let me put it this way, we just
didn't have a good connection."

196
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,070
So if you want to use this in a direct way,
you definitely can.

197
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:56,230
As opposed to our previous way, which is taking
something that's narrow, "Well, ah, I think

198
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,290
instead I should have stayed at my old job,"
you're being very indirect.

199
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:02,200
Instead, we're doing the opposite.

200
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,160
We're taking general words, "He's kind and
handsome, the food was good.

201
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,240
But let me put it this way, we just didn't
have a good connection."

202
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,860
You're making the summary of this situation
to be more direct.

203
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:21,370
The next phrase, "The thing is," can be used
both in an indirect way and in a direct way.

204
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,150
If you're talking about your new job that
you don't really like, you might say, "Well,

205
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,380
the thing is, I miss my old coworkers.

206
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,860
What are you trying to say here, but you're
not saying directly?

207
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:39,530
When you say, "I miss my old coworkers," you're
kind of implying that your new coworkers aren't

208
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,060
that great.

209
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:47,500
Maybe the atmosphere isn't very enjoyable
at the new job, but you're not saying that,

210
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,310
you're choosing to say something positive.

211
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,050
The thing is I miss my old coworkers.

212
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,370
This is quite indirect.

213
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:59,040
You're not directly saying something negative
about your new job.

214
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,240
But we can use, "The thing is," to be more
direct.

215
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,150
Let's look at that second situation where
you go on a date and it doesn't really go

216
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,150
that well.

217
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,690
You might use this as a conclusion or a summary.

218
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,550
"The thing is, we just didn't have a good
connection."

219
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,090
So you're being very direct.

220
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,120
The thing is, we just didn't have a good connection.

221
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,340
Instead of saying, "Well, the thing is, I
just don't really have much time to devote

222
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,120
to a relationship," this is very indirect.

223
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,550
You can also use it directly and say, "The
thing is, we just didn't have a good connection.:

224
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,510
It's straightforward and clear.

225
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,540
Let's go to the next one.

226
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,070
"Well, you see. "

227
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,040
If we want to talk about that new job that
you don't really like, you might say, "Well,

228
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,290
you see, the boss is nice, but I'm not a fan
of the commute."

229
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,750
Here you're being indirect.

230
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,300
You're saying something positive, but you're
also saying something negative, your true

231
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
feelings.

232
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,150
The boss is nice, but I'm not a fan of the
commute.

233
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:01,010
Well, you see, you're kind of introducing
this indirect statement.

234
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,050
But like the previous two, we can use this
to be more direct.

235
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,130
If you want to explain your boring date night
and your friend says, "Well, it looks like

236
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,180
everything was great.

237
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,180
The food was good.

238
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,870
He was nice and handsome, picked you up on
time.

239
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,320
What's wrong?"

240
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,240
You might say, "Well, you see, we just didn't
have a good connection."

241
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,850
So here you're summarizing, like in the previous
two expressions, you're summarizing this directly.

242
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,040
Well, you see, we just didn't have a good
connection.

243
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,491
If you go on a date with someone and you tell
them, "I'm sorry, I don't want to go on a

244
00:14:32,491 --> 00:14:36,480
second date because we just don't have a good
connection."

245
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,850
It's probably not the best thing to say to
them, at least in my opinion.

246
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:48,730
It feels like there's no way that the other
person can improve from that statement.

247
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,690
It's so general, but this is something that
people often say about going on a date, we

248
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,570
just didn't have a good connection, and so
I'm not going to go on another date.

249
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,540
We just didn't have a good connection.

250
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,210
In other words, if you're talking about that
boring job, you might say, "In other words,

251
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:06,910
I guess no job is perfect."

252
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,190
Well, you're not saying I hate this job.

253
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:16,570
Instead you're being indirect and saying,
"No job is perfect, every job has flaws.

254
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:20,690
Okay, I guess that I will continue with my
new job."

255
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,600
In other words, you're trying to explain something
with different words.

256
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,100
In other words, I guess no job is perfect.

257
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:34,320
We can use this phrase, in other words, for
positive situations, but it's more likely

258
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,720
to be used in negative situations.

259
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,940
So let's look at that date situation to see
how you can use it to be direct.

260
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,920
In other words, we just didn't have a good
connection.

261
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,660
"In other words," so you're saying all of
these indirect things, and then you're summarizing,

262
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,370
"In other words, we just didn't have a good
connection."

263
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:59,110
But if we want to use this phrase in a positive
situation, let's imagine that your date goes

264
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,160
wonderfully.

265
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,350
And you had such a fantastic time, you talked
for hours and hours, you felt so comfortable.

266
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:09,950
You might say, "In other words, I think he
is the one."

267
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:12,670
"The one," means your soulmate.

268
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,820
So you're summarizing your date by saying,
"In other words, I think he's the one.

269
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,190
This is it."

270
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,770
Same as before, you probably shouldn't tell
your date this after only one date, it's a

271
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,000
little bit strong, but feel free to tell your
friend if you want.

272
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,490
All right, let's review the second section
of explanatory phrases so that you can practice

273
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,490
them out loud.

274
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,100
I challenge you to speak out loud again, repeat
with my voice, and remember these phrases.

275
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,000
What I mean is, I'm going to be 30 minutes
late.

276
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,130
What I meant was that I will be at least 30
minutes late, traffic is awful.

277
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:54,550
Oh, I meant that I would be at least 30 minutes
late, traffic is awful.

278
00:16:54,550 --> 00:17:00,080
Let me put it this way, I should probably
have stayed at my old job.

279
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,390
The thing is, I thought I would like it, but
I miss my old coworkers.

280
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:09,849
Well, you see, the bosses nice, but I'm not
a fan of the commute.

281
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,639
In other words, I guess that no job is perfect.

282
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,069
Great work, practicing all of these phrases
for explaining things in English.

283
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:23,579
As you can see, there are a lot of different
nuances and ways that you can explain a process,

284
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,589
or explain and clarify your thoughts.

285
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,610
I hope that you'll be able to recognize these
phrases when native speakers use them, and

286
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,929
when you hear them and movies and TV shows,
but the next step above that is to be able

287
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:35,980
to use them yourself.

288
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,470
So feel free to repeat this lesson, and practice
them as much as possible.

289
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:42,269
And now I have a question for you.

290
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:45,490
Let's use those phrases for explaining a process.

291
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:51,480
In the comments, can you tell me what steps
you take this morning to get ready for the

292
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
day?

293
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,779
You might say, "Well, to start off with, I
got out of bed and washed my face," and then

294
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:02,879
you can go on and tell me the other things
that you did using those explanatory phrases.

295
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:07,240
Thank you so much for learning English with
me, and I'll see you again next Friday for

296
