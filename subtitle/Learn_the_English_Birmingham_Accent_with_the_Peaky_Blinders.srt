1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,279
So you want to learn how to sound like
you're from Birmingham, ay?

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,700
Well, I'm sure I can help with that.
Follow me. And no fighting!

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,680
Right let's keep this quick. If you want
to be a Peaky Blinder, you're gonna have to

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,279
sound like one.
So listen very carefully, I will say it only

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,680
once.
But if you want you can replay the video

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,600
to make sure you've
learnt everything but I will say it only once!

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,200
Right.
Let's start with the vowels. Very, very

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,840
important vowel in the Birmingham accent is the 'U'. We don't say 'but,'

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,960
'cut'.  We say put, but and cut.
It's an UH sound.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,760
Like a monkey. Don't be tempted to say
'under'.

11
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,920
Is that clear? Good. Listen to this
example:

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,530
"Arthur, shut up."

13
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,880
Shut up.
Shut up. Good let's carry on.

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,640
Now let's talk about diphthongs, right? So
you'll notice

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,320
in a word like this: game. The 'a'
moves. It goes like this:

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,960
A-E. Game. Name. Fame.
It's a lot less of an A-E

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,439
and it's more of an I-E so it's actually
more like you're going from an

18
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,799
I to an E rather than an A to an
E. Listen to the difference: name

19
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,920
name. Let's move on. So in words where in RP you might say this sound: 'oh.'

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,720
In Birmingham we say 'ow'.
'ow'. It's wider. It's actually a lot closer

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,119
to London. So instead of saying float we say

22
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,360
float. Can you see how i'm going from a
wide: Aah Ooh

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,119
Aah. It's like Ah. Aah Ooh. Float.

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,919
Boat. No. Listen to the difference
again:

25
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,300
Float. Float. Have a look at this example:

26
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:17,200
"He knows better words. Right, Pol?"

27
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,660
He knows. Oh. Alright let's move on:

28
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,440
'I' sound. Now, in RP you might say things

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,520
like: quit, fit, bit. However in Birmingham we

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,160
say: quit, bit, fit. Do you see how I'm making an

31
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:41,920
IH sound rather than an EH. It's a lot
more forward. Bit. It's closer to an E.

32
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
It's closer to E then anything else,
really.

33
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,680
It's in the nose. Alright? Quit.
Bit. Fit. Listen to this example:

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,860
"Whose duty it is."

35
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:57,600
Whose duty it is. It is. It is.

36
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,120
Moving on. In RP you would say words
like:

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,920
Bath, grass and pass. So that
'A' becomes an 'Ah'. However

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,400
in Birmingham we say bath, path
grass. Fast, past.

39
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,040
Alright? It's an 'A' sound rather than an
'Ah'. So in RP when you would say 'ah',

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
replace it with an 'A' like you're about to
say apple.

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,520
Alright? A-pple.

42
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,000
And finally, the vowel sound 'Y'. When words end in a 'Y',

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,840
like funny, money or...
I can't think of another word. Penny!

44
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
Thick Birmingham accents will pronounce the 'Y'

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,120
as an 'uy'. Penny. Money. It's like a diphthong at the end

46
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,840
it's like you've put a 'U' in it.
You're saying: money, penny.

47
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,319
Move your tongue from laying flat to
moving upwards and it'll block the

48
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,400
passage of air a little bit to help you
go money.

49
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,640
Just listen to this:

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
"Tommy!"

51
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,320
It's complex but i'm sure with practice you'll get there.

52
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,879
Alright let's move on
to consonants.

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,200
Birmingham like a lot of accents in the
UK is non-rhotic. Now,

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,100
non-rhotic means you don't pronounce the 'R' if it comes after a vowel.

55
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,000
So for example the word 'first',
'first'. It's actually closer to what we

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,440
call a schwa.
Which is a neutral sound that requires

57
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,880
nothing going on in your mouth it's an
uh uh. So words like 'first',

58
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,440
is open. It's an open sound:
'first'.

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,320
It's not 'first'. It's not 'first', alright?
'First', it's open, 'first'.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,840
When you get words that end
in 'er',  like mother, father, however.

61
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,200
Instead of going 'uh' we actually release
it into more of an, 'ah'.

62
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,900
sound. Like you would say apple. Mother,
father, however.

63
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,880
And there's one more thing you need to know about the letter 'r'.

64
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,720
in a Birmingham accent, alright?

65
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:08,880
If an 'r' is followed by a vowel, so
if a vowel comes after an 'r',

66
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,320
a lot of the time people from Birmingham
will roll the 'r',

67
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,720
give it a bit of a tap. Now this might
seem strange in an accent from the

68
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,440
British Isles, but I promise you I'm
telling the truth.

69
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,080
I wouldn't say roll your 'r's on every
single 'r', you'll sound a bit ridiculous.

70
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,200
It wavers between being 'rrr' and just a tap.

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,240
For example, listen to that! For example.

72
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,240
I don't really say
'for example' you can if you want but if

73
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,360
you're proper Brummie:
'for example '.

74
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,958
So these 'r's need to have a bit of a tap and the way we do a tap is

75
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,420
our tongue, the tip of our tongue taps on what we call the alveol-

76
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,380
on what we call the alveolar-

77
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,380
it's very hard to say.

78
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,240
The alveolar ridge, alright?

79
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:06,000
So, tip of your tongue that's your alveolar. So your teeth are there, and that bit of skin,

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
above your teeth, that's the alveolar
ridge. So you want

81
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,240
up there, alright? So, alright.
It's like you're saying a 'd.'  It's like you're

82
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,479
saying 'd'.

83
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,160
Alright.

84
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,980
Okay so we've got that little bit of a
tap, alright? Now let's hear some examples from the boss:

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,620
"Alright boys, you're all here."

86
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:37,440
You're all here. It's not 'you're. all. here."
Birmingham is a tricky one to understand

87
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,280
because we do link our words quite a bit, alright?
You're all here.

88
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,360
You're all here.  It's not you're. all. here.
You're all here, alright? Notice that

89
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,340
that tapped 'r',  you're all here.

90
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,020
Sorry.

91
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,000
"Do anything to embarrass her,"

92
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,280
To embarrass her.
To embarrass. Embarrass.

93
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,240
Notice it's not a proper embarrass it's
just a little tap, alright?

94
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,440
Embarrass. It's like a little... It's like you're saying 'embaddess."

95
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,880
Last example:

96
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,100
"Your cousins, your horses,"

97
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,420
And that example leads me very well onto my next consonant which is 'H'.

98
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,840
And very often in Birmingham we drop
our 'H's, so we don't say them, alright?

99
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,720
So, notice in, 'your horses,"
we don't say your horses we say

100
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
your horses.
Almost like the word horse starts with

101
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,060
an 'O'. Okay final consonant the letter 't'.

102
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,599
You'll notice that 't's in the birmingham accent
are quite delicate

103
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,440
so for example if I said the words to you:
put.

104
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,479
Put. You'll notice that the 't' is quite
weak. Put. Bit. Bet.

105
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,240
It's like the the the teeth don't quite
close, in a way.

106
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,720
But. Bet. You know we actually make the
't' more with our tongue

107
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,080
rather than closing our teeth together
which is what a lot of people do.

108
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,639
So, but, pet, bit, bit.
There's a little gap in my teeth, alright?

109
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,479
And I'm tapping the alveolar ridge.
Bit. It's like it's a breathy 't'. Breathy.

110
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,440
It's kind of unvoiced, alright? Bit.
It's like you're whispering the end of

111
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,120
the word, okay?
Here's a very good example:

112
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,540
"Similar to the one described in that report,"

113
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,840
In that report.

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,700
It's like a whisper at the end of the
word. In that report.

115
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,780
Now let's talk about the tone, alright?

116
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,080
The tone.  Now in Birmingham we do tend to go down

117
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,839
at the end of our words quite a bit. So
most of our sentences

118
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,280
in Birmingham do end on a down, alright?
so we'll finish our sentence and end it on a down.

119
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,240
Okay I think I've taught you all I know

120
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,320
so, we're gonna do a practice sentence, alright?

121
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,800
Let's see how you do.
Our practice sentence goes like this:

122
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
This place is now under new management. By order of the

123
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,720
Peaky Blinders.
Let's go through it. This place

124
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,320
This, remember our 'Ih' sound when we've got an 'I',

125
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:16,400
This place. Place. Remember, place.
This place is now under

126
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,200
new management, alright? Pretty much the same. Under new management.

127
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,360
By order of, see how we link those words:

128
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,120
order of. Order of. With the little tapped. By order of the

129
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,279
Peaky Blinders. Have a go at practicing
that every now and again you should be

130
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,640
alright. Thank you very much for

Not me obviously it'll be the
other lady that

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,600
runs this Youtube channel. But it's
been a pleasure

135
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,040
and just remember there are lots of
accents in the UK

136
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
and Birmingham is only one of them. But
it's wonderful. Birmingham is a city that

137
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,240
extends far beyond the Peaky Blinders.
It is a vibrant, lively and down-to-earth

138
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,220
city.
So if you're ever in the UK, pay it a visit!

139
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,000
Tata!

140
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,680
(Take a shot for how many times I say 'alright' in this video."
