00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,120
- Hello, lovely students and welcome back
to English with Lucy. Before we start today's

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,090
lesson, I've got a question for you. Can you
understand what I'm saying and I really hope

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,270
you said yes because I often read comments
on my videos saying things like I can understand

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:24,060
you perfectly but I can't understand my coworkers.
Or why can I understand you but I have to

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,220
watch British series and films with subtitles.
Well, in today's lesson I'm going to explain

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,950
why you have so much difficulty understanding
native speakers and I'll give you some tips

7
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:41,310
to help you overcome these challenges. Now,
before we get started, don't forget to download

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:47,500

today's lesson. It's going to give you a detailed

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,190
explanation of each of today's points as well
as a quiz to test your understanding. We'll

10
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:58,931
also mark out some key vocabulary, so you
get a little vocab bonus there. If you would

16
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:35,740
started with the lesson. Tip number one, understand
that spoken English is different from textbook

17
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,750
or school English. This is a really important
concept to understand is going to help you

18
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:49,149
so much. Now, simply put the English that
native speakers use in everyday life is generally

19
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,280
very different to the English that you learn
at school. I'm talking about casual everyday

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,399
type English that you'd use in daily conversations.
Now, I'll admit it when I speak in my YouTube

21
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:08,090
and course videos, I do speak at a slightly
slower pace. I choose my words carefully and

22
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,480
I make sure that my register is suitable for
English learners. I want you to be able to

23
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,890
understand each word I say. But most native
speakers you meet on the street will not necessarily

24
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,090
have the same mindset. Or they might not be
as able to change their register to adapt

25
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,900
to learners of English. Take my mother for
example. Many years ago I had a Spanish boyfriend

26
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:35,561
who didn't speak English and watching my mother
try to talk to him was pretty hilarious. She

27
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:41,410
was using idioms, phrasal verbs, dropping
her Ts, messing around with the pronunciation

28
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,280
and the poor guy stood no chance for a number
of reasons and not just when it comes to understanding

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,560
my mother. Here are some examples of how spoken
English and textbook English might differ

30
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,540
from a grammar standpoint. There are certain
tenses and grammatical structures that are

31
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,140
far more commonly used in written English
than they are in spoken English, like the

32
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:10,130
passive voice which is a grammatical construction
used to emphasise the action or object rather

33
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:17,630
than the subject or doer. It's often preferred
in academic writing formal reports and professional

34
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,220
documents. For example, the decision was made
by the committee. Sticking on the topic of

35
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,989
grammar you may have been taught that you
shouldn't end sentences with prepositions.

36
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:33,849
Well I'm here to tell you that native speakers
do it all the time. It might be confusing

37
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:39,150
to hear a random preposition at the end of
a sentence, but trust me, it's really common.

38
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:46,069
Like in this example, who are you going with?
It honestly sounds way too proper to say With

39
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:51,060
whom are you going? Obviously, if you say
it without the accent with whom are you going

40
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,270
it sounds slightly less proper but it sounds
old fashioned at best. Another example, it

41
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,680
sounds way more natural to say she didn't
know who to give the gift to rather than the

42
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,750
textbook English version she didn't know to
whom to give the gift. I also want to point

43
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,650
out that we tend to bend other rules a bit
when speaking. For example, you might hear

44
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,790
someone say I haven't got any money which
is common in spoken British English. While

45
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,920
in school you're most likely taught to say
I don't have any money. Another example of

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,970
this is in the expression can't believe it,
where we drop the subject and utilise the

47
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,380
contraction of cannot. Obviously, you are
taught in school to always include a subject

48
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,990
like I cannot believe it but that doesn't
always happen in conversation. Tip number

49
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,639
two. Get feedback from trained, qualified
professionals. If you are serious about truly

50
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:54,550
mastering English there really is no better
way than one-on-one sessions with a qualified

51
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:01,170
professional. Trying to progress without feedback
is really bloody hard. There's no better place

52
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:07,300
to do this than LanguaTalk which is a company
that I think is so awesome. I decided to become

53
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,360
a part of it. So technically I'm sponsoring
myself here. LanguaTalk is an online language

54
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,110
tutor platform with incredibly high quality
teachers. Across all the languages they only

55
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:24,789
accept around 10% of applicants, but for English
it's much lower. Their standards are that

56
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:30,350
high. I'm currently using it to learn Italian.
My husband will uses it to learn Spanish and

57
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:36,450
you can join us and learn English there. The
teachers are top notch. Now, a little incentive.

58
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:42,250
I will give you $10 in lesson credit if you
sign up and take your first lesson after watching

59
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:47,419
this video. So as well as being able to log
in, look through all the teacher's profile

60
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:54,860
videos, book a 30 minute trial lesson for
free. You can also claim $10 towards lessons

61
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:01,380

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:07,270
from today onwards. The link is in the description
box. Have a look, have a browse, and find

63
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:14,729
your perfect fit for a tutor. Tip number three,
native speakers don't articulate. This is

64
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:19,520
the topic of connected speech. So one of the
things I'm sure you'll pick up on while listening

65
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,900
to British content or in conversations with
your LanguaTalk tutor or native English speaking

66
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:32,199
friends, is that we love to squish our words
together and get information out as quickly

67
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,979
and efficiently as possible, and this is known
as connected speech which refers to the way

68
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:44,090
words are linked together in natural fluent
speech. Now, there are several key aspects

69
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:48,500
of connected speech that you need to be aware
of. And I'm not going to go too deep into

70
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,310
this right now but I want you to be aware
of certain features you will definitely hear

71
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,699
in spoken British English. We'll start with
elision. Elision is the omission or leaving

72
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:04,690
out of certain sounds and speech often to
make pronunciation more efficient and fluid.

73
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:11,790
In British English, the most common example
is the dropping of the final t sound in words

74
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:19,280
like not, but and what. For example, I don't
know, might be pronounced as I don' know,

75
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,660
no t sound to be found there. Assimilation.
Assimilation occurs when a sound changes to

76
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,000
become more like a neighbouring sound. In
British English this often happens with the

77
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:42,780
t and d sounds when followed by a y sound
t and y often sounds like ch and d and y often

78
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:51,870
sounds like j. For example. Got you, go'chew.
Would you, wou'jew? Now, this one is really

79
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:59,130
fun. The intrusive r. In British English an
r sound is sometimes inserted between two

80
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:05,099
vow sounds to make the transition smoother
and this is particularly common in non-erotic

81
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:10,220
accents such as received pronunciation or
modern received pronunciation, my accent.

82
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:17,330
For example, law and order may be pronounced
as law-r-and order. I've inserted an Ur R

83
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,611
sound that isn't meant to be there but I've
put it there because it's easier for me. Now

84
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:26,990
as well as the intrusive r we also have the
linking r, and this is really similar but

85
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,779
it occurs when a word ending in the letter
r is followed by a word beginning with a vowel

86
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:40,279
sound. In non-erotic accents the r is pronounced
to connect the two words. For example far

87
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:48,200
away may be pronounced as fa-raway, fa-raway.
Far on its own no r sound, but when followed

88
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,089
by a word starting with a vowel sound fa-raway,
it's just natural to put it in there. And

89
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:59,029
let's look at weak forms. In connected speech,
certain words are often pronounced with a

90
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:06,510
reduced or weak form. And this is particularly
common with function words such as prepositions

91
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:14,800
articles and auxiliary verbs. For example,
two may be pronounced as t and and maybe pronounced

92
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,950
as n. So. That was a very quick overview.
We do have more videos on connected speech.

93
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,920
It is actually one of my favourite topics.
Understanding how frequently connected speech

94
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,920
is used will go a long way in improving your
comprehension skills. Let's move on to tip

95
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,100
four contractions and unique language features.
I feel like contractions go hand in hand with

96
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,730
connected speech. Contractions as I have talked
about in previous videos refer to the shortening

97
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:48,720
of words by combining two or more words, there
are sometimes triplets in there, together.

98
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,420
This process involves emitting certain letters
and replacing them with an apostrophe. In

99
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,560
spoken English native speakers pretty much
always use contractions. For example, we don't

100
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,190
say, I am from England. We say I'm from England,
I'm is the contraction there. Here are some

101
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:13,030
common contractions, but please be sure to
download today's PDF to see a full list. As

102
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:19,360
I said before, the link is in the description
box. We have, I'm, you're, we're, they're,

103
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:28,460
he's, she's, it's, I've, you've, we've, they've,
I'll, you'll, we'll, they'll, can't, didn't,

104
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:36,089
won't, coulda, woulda, shoulda let's, there's,
that's, I could go on forever about contractions

105
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,870
and maybe I should let me know if you want
a focused video on contractions. Now we also

106
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:47,010
have informal contractions which combine two
or more words into shorter words but they

107
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:52,920
are quite informal and they're used in very
casual conversations like in this sentence.

108
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,290
I hafta go to the shops if you wanna come
rather than I have to go to the shops if you

109
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:03,790
want to come. These kinds of informal contractions
are extremely popular and tend to cause a

110
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,120
lot of confusion for English learners so the
more familiar you become with them, the quicker

111
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,889
your listening skills will improve. Here we
have some very common ones like usta, kinda,

112
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:26,610
lotsa, coulda, Ida, sheeda, how'dja, and what'dja.
Final tip, learn idioms and slang. If you

113
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:31,910
want to understand native speakers this is
unavoidable. As English learners I'm sure

114
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:37,060
you were taught to speak in a very direct
form of English to say exactly what you mean.

115
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,589
But unfortunately native speakers don't often
speak in such a way. We tend to use a lot

116
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:48,130
of slang and idioms because it adds colour
and character to what we're trying to say

117
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,970
and I'm sure you do the same in your native
language. I know I said that connected speech

118
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,970
is one of my favourite things to teach, but
I actually think that idioms and slang is

119
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:03,980
too, I can't decide, so I won't. I'll just
enjoy them both. Slang and idioms are often

120
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,160
used to express ideas or emotions in a more
creative and nuanced way than standard direct

121
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,510
English but this also tends to make it challenging
for English learners to understand. Here are

122
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:22,500
some very common slang terms that you will
most likely encounter in daily conversation.

123
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:31,779
Grub. Food, particularly pub food or unhealthy
food food that fills you. Lurgy. An unspecified

124
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,610
mild illness or feeling unwell. It's like
a general call or I've got some sort of lurgy.

125
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:44,110
Dab hand. If you're a dab hand at something
you are skilled or proficient at something.

126
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:49,790
Fit, this is used to mean attractive rather
than just physically fit which which it means

127
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:55,320
a normal English and slang English. If I say
you are so fit, it means you are so attractive.

128
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:03,339
We also have merry or tipsy meaning slightly
drunk while wasted or pissed signifies being

129
00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:10,340
heavily intoxicated. Be careful because pissed
in British English means heavily drunk and

130
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:16,800
pissed in American English means angry. In
British English we tend to say pissed off,

131
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,839
a phrasal verb. One of my favourites, I use
this all the time, knackered, if you are knackered,

132
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:29,070
you are extremely tired. I also like to say
chuffed. Ah, which means very happy or pleased

133
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,730
or kind of smug and satisfied. I'm chuffed
with my exam result. Okay, I have put loads

134
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:41,339
more idioms and slang phrases in the pdf,
so don't forget to download that. If you enjoy

135
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:46,880
learning about slang and idioms let me know
and I can make a dedicated video for you.

136
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,370
It's something I enjoy teaching, so if you
like it and I like it, I mean we should get

137
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,880
together and and make a video. Right, that's
it from me. That's it for today's lesson.

138
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,699
I really hope these tips help you. Again,
don't forget about the PDF. The link is there.

139
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:05,740
It's designed to help you and don't forget
about that offer on LanguaTalk. It really

140
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,690
is an awesome platform. Otherwise, I wouldn't
have become a part of it. Use that code for

141
