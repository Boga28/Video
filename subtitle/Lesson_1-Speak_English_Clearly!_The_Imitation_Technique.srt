00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,660
Hello! Welcome to the very first video
training lesson for the imitation technique.

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,860
Thank you so much for signing up!
I know you are going to love this training.

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,540
Now, imitating something is
similar to copying something.

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:33,800
Usually, imitating is copying actions or words so
this technique is all about copying

5
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,340
something that a native speaker is
saying, exactly.

6
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:46,460
It teaches you to listen to the sounds and patterns of English and trains you to make those same

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:54,620
sounds yourself. You're training your mouth
with your ears.

8
00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:02,780
So you're listening to the sounds and you're not training your mouth with your eyes by reading and

9
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:10,060
guessing the pronunciation of words, you
are training your mouth with your ears.

10
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,520
By practising with this technique, you'll
reduce your accent and pronunciation

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,659
problems more quickly and become a
clearer and more confident English

12
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,930
speaker. Now, there are three steps that
you'll need to remember when you're

13
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:35,070
using the imitation technique. First,
you'll need to listen to me and read the

14
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:42,480
text at the same time. So when I talk on
this video you'll see the words come up

15
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,720
at the bottom of the screen. In the text,
the important stress has been marked so

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,760
you'll be able to hear the stresses in
my expression and read them as well.

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,180
Then, it will be your turn! So you're going to
hear me read each sentence again but

18
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:06,780
there will be a pause after each one and
this is where you'll need to copy

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,580
exactly what I've said.

20
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,260
Listen for my pronunciation,

21
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:19,360
the stress, the pause, the intonation and
then you'll need to copy it exactly.

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,020
You can do this step as many times as you
need to before you move on to step

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:32,550
number three. Then the bigger challenge
is for you to shadow me, which is to copy

24
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,700
everything that I'm saying again but
this time you won't have any text on the

25
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,340
screen, you're just listening to the
words that I'm saying.

26
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,960
Now it might be a little bit tricky, especially the first time, because you'll be listening to me

27
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,500
and speaking at the same time! So it
might take you a few times to get

28
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,020
comfortable doing it. And remember that
you might not understand everything

29
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,800
that's being said as I'm saying it, but
that's not the point of this training.

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,720
We're not testing your understanding of
English. We're testing and practising

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,780
your pronunciation and speaking skills.
So if you don't understand it, don't worry!

32
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,760
But do it again and again and
again until the sounds that you are

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,080
making sound very similar to the ones
that I'm making in the video.

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,360
And that's it! The imitation technique is simple yet so effective.

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:45,840
If you practise this technique regularly, soon you'll sound
more natural, more confident and more

36
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,880
relaxed when you're speaking English.
Let's try it!

37
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,720
I love to travel to different countries,
I love meeting new people and tasting

38
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,830
different foods (that's my favorite part!)
To date, I think I've visited about twenty-two

39
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,840
different countries but there are so
many more places on my list.

40
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:23,560
Almost every person that I know, who has a decent
income, does some sort of travel every year,

41
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,280
usually overseas. to a different
country. In my opinion, travelling overseas

42
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,120
and to different countries makes us more
accepting of each other's differences

43
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,080
and teaches us respect for different
cultures, traditions and beliefs.

44
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,320
It also helps me to tell some pretty interesting
stories about my adventures.

45
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,680
I love talking to people about places they've
visited and things that they've seen in

46
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,460
the world,. I think it's because I can
easily relate to them and it's easy for

47
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:04,250
me to share my stories and experiences
with them. Plus, I love getting

48
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:09,740
recommendations about places to visit. It
helps me to plan where my next holiday

49
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,760
is going to be.

50
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,200
Okay, now for step number
two. You're going to imitate exactly what

51
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,740
I say - the pronunciation, the stress, the
pause. And there will be a pause after

52
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,220
each sentence that will let you do that.
Ready?

53
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,480
I love to travel to different countries

54
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,680
I love meeting new people and tasting
different foods

55
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,580
(that's my favorite part!)

56
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,520
To date, I think I have visited about

57
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,500
twenty-two different countries

58
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,460
but there are so many more places on my
list.

59
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,060
Almost every person that I know,

60
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,880
who has a decent income,

61
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,100
does some sort of travel every year,

62
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,880
usually overseas, to a different country.

63
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,220
In my opinion, travelling overseas and to different

64
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,400
countries

65
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,360
makes us more accepting of each
other's differences

66
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,660
and teaches us

67
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,920
respect for different cultures,

68
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,860
traditions and beliefs.

69
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,520
It also helps me to

70
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,920
tell some pretty interesting stories
about my adventures.

71
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,980
I love talking to people about places
they've visited

72
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,880
and things that they have seen in the world.

73
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,600
I think it's because I can easily relate to them and

74
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,480
that's easy for me to share my stories

75
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,900
and experiences with them.

76
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,580
Plus, I love getting recommendations
about places to visit.

77
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,660
It helps me to plan where my next
holiday is going to be.

78
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:03,480
This is step three, where you're going to
shadow exactly what I've said,

79
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:11,760
as I'm saying it. So you'll be listening to me
and speaking at the same time.

80
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:20,840
Remember, it might take you a couple of goes to
get this right but that's OK! Ready?

81
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,740
I love to travel to different countries.
I love meeting new people and tasting

82
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:35,860
different foods (that's my favorite part).
To date, I think I've visited about twenty-two

83
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,740
different countries but there are so
many more places on my list.

84
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:49,180
Almost every person that I know, who has a decent
income, does some sort of travel every

85
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:56,520
year, usually overseas to a different
country. In my opinion, travelling overseas

86
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,060
and to different countries makes us more
accepting of each other's differences

87
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:08,860
and teaches us respect for different
cultures, traditions and beliefs.

88
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,540
It also helps me to tell some pretty interesting
stories about my adventures!

89
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,860
I love talking to people about places they've
visited and things that they've seen in

90
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,640
the world. I think it's because I can
easily relate to them and it's easy for

91
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,279
me to share my stories and experiences
with them. Plus, I love getting

92
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:35,769
recommendations about places to visit. It
helps me to plan where my next holiday

93
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,310
is going to be.

94
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,640
So that's it! Tomorrow I'm going to send
you a new lesson to practise with!

95
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,060
If you're watching this on YouTube and you
haven't signed up on my website yet, you

96
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,980
