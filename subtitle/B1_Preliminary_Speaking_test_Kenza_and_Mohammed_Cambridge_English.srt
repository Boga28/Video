Good afternoon. Good afternoon.

Where do you come from?

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,600
From Saudi Arabia.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,000
Thank you. Mohammed, do you

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,600
I work in a Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:47,040
Thank you. And Kenza, do you
work, or are you a student?

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,800
I was a student, but I have
finished at university.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,600
What do you do? Now

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,000
I have my own salon beauty.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,640
Thank you. Do you think that English will
be useful for you in the future?

18
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,640
Yes, I think that English is the most
useful language in all of the world

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,320
because its permit us to achieve our
objectives

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,280
and to go further than we think.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,800
Tell us about the people you live with.

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,720
I live with my family in my country,
and we are neighbours

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,640
and they are some of them
are cousin of us, of me.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,320
Kenza, how do you get to work every day?

25
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,640
I generally get to work by car.

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,920
What did you do yesterday evening,
Mohammed?

27
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
I've been rather gathering with my friends

28
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,840
and we go into one Middle East
restaurant here in Cambridge.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Thank you. Thank you.

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
Now, I'd like each of you to talk
on your own about something.

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,760
I'm going to give each of you a photograph

32
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,560
and I'd like you to talk about it.

33
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,080
Kenza, here is your photograph.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,880
It shows someone 
getting information about something.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,600
Mohammed, you just listen.

36
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,800
Kenza, please tell
us what you can see in the photograph.

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,680
I can see a lady which is maybe connecting
of a laptop

38
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,880
and reading on a book. He is

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,960
normally in a library or

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,160
I don't think she is at home.

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,960
Maybe she is preparing for an exam,
for getting more information.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,080
Maybe she is revising.

43
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
That's it.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,800
Talk about the place.

45
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,440
I can see that she is in a library

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,160
there are a lot of books,
and she is sitting alone.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:29,280
As I said before, she's maybe revising or
preparing for an exam or presentation or

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,920
Thank you.

49
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,480
Mohammed, here is your photograph.
It shows someone relaxing at home.

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,280
Kenza, you just listen.

51
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,280
Mohammed, please tell us
what you can see in the photograph.

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:57,080
Yeah, I see one man, he's relaxing in his
sofa, and he left his mobile on the floor

53
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,880
because he didn't want to
distract by his mobile.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,000
And maybe he's a musican
because there is one guitar

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
just next to him and

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,520
maybe he just come from outside and
he didn't take out his clothes.

57
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:25,760
He just start to eat and having one cup
of tea and relaxing in his home. And

58
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:35,360
maybe he's live alone because there's 
no-one with him and his home is very tidy.

59
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,320
There's no toys for his
children or something.

60
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,920
That's mean that really maybe live
alone in his flat.

61
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,200
And I think that the weather outside
is cold because he didn't-- Thank you.

62
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,520
Now, in this part of the test

63
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,280
you're going to talk about something
together for about two minutes.

64
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,280
I'm going to describe a situation to you.

65
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,120
A local football club is celebrating
its fiftieth anniversary

66
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,400
and wants to give its fans a gift. Here
are some gifts the club could give.

67
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,480
Talk together about the different things
it could give, and decide which

68
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,400
the fans would like best. All right?
Now, talk together.

69
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,520
I think the calendar is perfect or 
a t-shirt, because for me, the calendar

70
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,680
I can see my club every day when
I just checking the date.

71
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,840
I can see my club, and they are enjoying
by the fifth anniversary for the fourth

72
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,760
or fifth established for their club.

73
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,040
I think the t-shirt is the best idea. So

74
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,400
if he had the t-shirt with him, he
can always remember the team.

75
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,400
But sometime you can't wear
the same t-shirt every day.

76
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,320
But at least you have it at home and you 
can see it even if you don't wear it.

77
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,200
And for this football, I think no, because
I can't play football every day.

78
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,840
If there is some students
or from their friends

79
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,120
they can't play and keep it away from
their studying or something.

80
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,320
I think it would be a good idea
for the balloon football.

81
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:51,840
Yeah. And for this, there, no, because
all, they have a lot of children

82
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:00,280
and from their fans, they can give it to
their children. Yes. For a book or album.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,640
I think it's album for pictures.

84
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,840
For pictures. Yes.

85
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,680
Yes. It would be nice.

86
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,360
So that he can put all her pictures in
this album and he can watch pictures

87
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,360
whatever he wants.

88
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,880
And you keep remembering
your team by my, like, cover.

89
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,280
It's amazing. Yes. What about this bag?
What do you think about this bag?

90
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,640
I don't think that it's a good idea.

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
But it's useful nowadays.

92
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,080
You can use it for going to school
or for going to the gym.

93
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,800
You can put your toes.

94
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
Thank you.

95
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,920
Which sports do you like?

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,600
I prefer football. I love football.
My admire is football.

97
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,760
I watch it. I play it. I

98
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,640
am very interested about football. I
watch it from when I was child.

99
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,040
I rise with football. Yeah.

100
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,680
For me, is swimming. I love swimming.
I really enjoy swimming.

101
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,840
It doesn't matter if it will be
on summer or on springs.

102
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,640
I love swimming in the swimming pool,
but specially on the beach.

103
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,640
It's my favourite activity to do.

104
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:37,600
Yeah, swimming help me some time to relax.
Yeah. If I swim that I lose my weight

105
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,800
and like flying and, yeah, like
floating in the water.

106
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,560
Swimming permits us to be relaxed.

107
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Yeah.

108
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,560
Why do so many people like football?

109
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,760
Because everyone can watch it.

110
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:02,320
And if you have one team in your, like,
hometown or your country, he won

111
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,960
a lot of competitions, that make
a lot of supporters, we can

112
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:15,040
if they have the same admires and the
same ambition about their teams.

113
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,520
And for me, it's the best sport. Yeah.

114
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Do you agree?

115
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,320
Yes, I agree. I think that football is
an international sport in every country.

116
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:33,200
We can see that there is a lot of teams
which playing footballs. Yes, I agree.

117
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,240
Do you have a favourite sports team?

118
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,680
Yes, for me, it's the Algerian team.

119
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
Do you agree?

120
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,280
Yeah, for me, I have one football team.
It's from England. Manchester United.

121
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:55,680
I love this team. 
I go to Old Trafford two times.

122
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,760
It was amazing.

123
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,120
Is it a good idea to join a fan club?

124
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:14,480
Yeah. To take in ideas and to keep discuss
about our team with what we miss in

125
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:22,600
on some positions, or if we need to have
a new players, we discuss about

126
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,600
the gomers, if they have, like,
one player that they decide to

127
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,120
have a contract with him. If he good
for this position or no, yeah.

128
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,760
What do you think?
I'm not for this fan club. Why?

129
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,600
Because I think it's a waste of time
and I don't have enough time to study.

130
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,720
So, I can't go to this kind of activities.

131
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,160
Thank you. That is the end
of the test. Thank you.
