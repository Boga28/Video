1
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:03,433
Hi
there. Why am

2
00:00:03,433 --> 00:00:04,366
I
wearing this?

3
00:00:05,233 --> 00:00:06,700
Well, today
let's talk about

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,733
how cities
around the world

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:09,099
are

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:11,000
transforming
their streets

7
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:12,966
to
accommodate greater

8
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,099
numbers of

9
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,199
cyclists,
people on bikes.

10
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
The
hope is that

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,566
this
makes it a safer

12
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:21,333
and more

13
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:22,866
enjoyable
way to travel.

14
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,933
Just
imagine if your daily

15
00:00:24,933 --> 00:00:25,933
journey
to work

16
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:26,966
could help

17
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:28,600
improve
your health,

18
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,766
reduce your
carbon footprint,

19
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,266
and
either bring

20
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:33,833
you
closer to nature

21
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:34,966
so that
you can

22
00:00:34,966 --> 00:00:36,100
hear the
birds singing

23
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,466
or help
you take in the

24
00:00:38,466 --> 00:00:39,600
vibrant
culture

25
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,933
of a big city.

26
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,833
So today
I'm talking about

27
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,833
the
boom in cycling.

28
00:00:45,366 --> 00:00:47,500
Apparently
in London, bike

29
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,733
use is
up by 20%

30
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,899
in the
last few years.

31
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,133
And new
cycle lanes, that's

32
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:55,233
roads
and pathways

33
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:56,899
built
specifically for

34
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,933
bicycles,
are a

35
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,033
big part
of this.

36
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,799
Another
European city that I

37
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,000
love to
visit, Amsterdam.

38
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,833
I like
Amsterdam, I

39
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,900
love
its atmosphere.

40
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,200
But what's
really noticeable

41
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,933
to
someone like me

42
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,000
from
the UK when

43
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,133
I visit
Amsterdam,

44
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,733
the huge
numbers of cyclists.

45
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:19,166
My
memories of Amsterdam

46
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,033
include
nearly being run over

47
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:23,599
by cyclists on

48
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,799
several
occasions.

49
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:26,799
British
people forget

50
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,366
to look
for cyclists

51
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:29,533
when
crossing the road

52
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,133
because
we're just not used

53
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,633
to
seeing that many.

54
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:33,433
And I'm
sure the

55
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,933
Amsterdam
cyclists

56
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,133
curse
British tourists like

57
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:39,266
me for
those near misses.

58
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:40,533
But
today let's

59
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,633
look at
cycling

60
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,400
and at
whether it

61
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,533
might
be the solution

62
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:45,533
to some of our

63
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,333
environmental
problems.

64
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,299
There's
some great vocabulary

65
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:50,433
in this
podcast

66
00:01:50,666 --> 00:01:51,266
for English

67
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:52,200
language
learners.

68
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,000
And if you
listen right to

69
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
the end
of the podcast,

70
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:56,400
I'll
talk about

71
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,666
a
brilliant idea

72
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:59,000
that
might make

73
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,500
cycling
safe, popular,

74
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,966
and
accessible everywhere,

75
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,700
not just
in the big cities

76
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:07,533
and at
no extra cost.

77
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:27,733
Listen
to the end

78
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:28,699
to hear
that one.

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,166
Before I
get onto that,

80
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,099
please

95
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:57,666
People say to

96
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,099
us all
the time,

97
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:00,966
"Your

98
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,133
I'm
surprised you don't have

99
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:03,866
more
listeners."

100
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:05,266
We think
that too.

101
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,400
So
please help us out.

102
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,066
Thank you
for doing that.

103
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,199
So
vocabulary first of all,

104
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:12,633
the
words cycle,

105
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,699
bicycle,
and bike

106
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,800
all mean
the same thing,

107
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,633
that
two-wheeled vehicle that

108
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:20,066
most of
us learn to ride

109
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,900
as children.

110
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,233
And the
verbs for

111
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,800
this
topic are similar.

112
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:25,199
We
probably wouldn't talk

113
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,366
about
bicycling,

114
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:27,766
but we
would talk about

115
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:30,466
cycling
or biking.

116
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:31,800
So
that's the verb

117
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,333
to bike,
B I K E.

118
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:35,866
Both
forms are used.

119
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,366
And you'll
have heard me talk

120
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:38,599
in
previous podcasts

121
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,199
about
the move towards

122
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:42,933
electric
vehicles or EVs.

123
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,099
This is
most Western

124
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,699
governments'
response

125
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:48,800
to the
requirement to go

126
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,900
carbon
neutral.

127
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,199
I've
talked in previous

128
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:53,000
podcasts
also about

129
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,400
how the
current design of

130
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,900
electric
vehicles

131
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,300
isn't going to

132
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,766
serve
people's needs.

133
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,466
And
neither is there

134
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:02,533
infrastructure

135
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,366
to supply
the electricity

136
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,466
and the
charging

137
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,866
points
that we need.

138
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,266
Infrastructure,

139
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,566
I N F R A S T R U C T U R E.

140
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,500
That means
services, things

141
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,566
like
electricity and roads.

142
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,666
With
imposed deadlines in the

143
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:21,466
next
few years,

144
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,433
it's really
difficult to see

145
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,566
how
we're going to

146
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,966
arrive at
net zero.

147
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,866
And there
are other issues.

148
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:29,166
We're going to

149
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,333
struggle
to get away

150
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,300
from the
use of plastic,

151
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:35,000
P L A S T I C.

152
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,166
It's a big
by-product of the

153
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:39,000
petrochemical
industry,

154
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,666
but
it's one that we

155
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,733
absolutely
rely on.

156
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,933
Medical
supplies,

157
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:45,733
household
items,

158
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:48,000
the
interior of your car and

159
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,366
food
packaging.

160
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,000
What
would we do

161
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,266
without
plastic?

162
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,100
So we're
still reliant on

163
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,399
fossil
fuels for many things.

164
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:58,899
But
imagine a future where

165
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,199
our
streets are filled

166
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,500
with the
gentle hum of

167
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,100
bicycles
instead of cars,

168
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:06,166
much cleaner

169
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,266
air, for
one thing.

170
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,399
If more
and more of us are

171
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:10,699
going to be
living in cities

172
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,300
much
closer together,

173
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:14,800
cycling
could be the solution

174
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,066
to our
transport problems.

175
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,466
Could
more of our

176
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,300
journeys
be done by bike?

177
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:22,100
Once
you've bought a bike,

178
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,566
it's
very cheap to run.

179
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:25,300
There's
no fuel needed,

180
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,000
except for the

181
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,066
effort
you put in,

182
00:05:27,366 --> 00:05:28,366
the
calories that

183
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:29,833
you burn
cycling.

184
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,800
As long
as the air is

185
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,033
relatively
clean,

186
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,866
cycling
is good for your

187
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:35,933
health
and your

188
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:37,100
level of
fitness.

189
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,100
So back to
those statistics.

190
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,833
Cycling in
London is up by

191
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,100
20%
since 2019.

192
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,166
And it's
estimated that 1.26

193
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:49,166
million
journeys

194
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:50,733
are
made by bike

195
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,500
every
day in London.

196
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,300
1.26
million! That's a lot!

197
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,899
And
apparently the

198
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,800
number
of trips by car,

199
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,366
journeys
by car, has fallen

200
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:02,666
drastically in

201
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:03,666
the
same period.

202
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:05,066
And in
fact, the number of

203
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,100
journeys
by bike

204
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,533
has
quadrupled.

205
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,800
That means
it's gone up, it's

206
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,666
increased
by four times.

207
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:12,899
The
reasons for the

208
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:14,000
popularity of

209
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,899
cycling
are easy to see.

210
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,633
You've the
choice to drive,

211
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:18,666
but in London,

212
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,000
that
just means

213
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,133
sitting
in traffic

214
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,300
for long
periods of time,

215
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,233
very
frustrating.

216
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,066
The
roads in London are

217
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:28,000
extremely
congested

218
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:30,233
and
increasingly restricted.

219
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:30,966
There's the

220
00:06:30,966 --> 00:06:32,566
congestion
charge to pay,

221
00:06:33,066 --> 00:06:34,533
and
fewer and fewer of

222
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,366
London's
roads are

223
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:37,600
available
to cars.

224
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,866
Getting
anywhere in London by

225
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,899
car is
unsatisfactory.

226
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,399
I do
drive in London

227
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,100
sometimes
when I go

228
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,233
to
visit my daughter,

229
00:06:46,466 --> 00:06:47,399
but it's not a

230
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,366
pleasant
experience

231
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,633
and I do
try to avoid it and

232
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,000
go on
the tube instead.

233
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,533
And
public transport, the

234
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:53,899
London

235
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:55,300
Underground,
for instance,

236
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,433
the
tube that I

237
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:57,100
just
mentioned,

238
00:06:57,466 --> 00:06:58,666
that is
still the most

239
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,899
efficient
way to travel

240
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,666
around
London, but there are

241
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:02,866
strikes
and problems

242
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:04,266
with
certain tube lines.

243
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,166
So it's

244
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,166
understandable
that people prefer

245
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,500
to be
above ground, getting

246
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,433
their exercise

247
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,733
on
their way to work.

248
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:12,933
If you have a

249
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,100
busy
London life,

250
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,399
then
getting your exercise in

251
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,000
at the
same time

252
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:19,866
as your
commute to work,

253
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,633
well, that
just makes sense.

254
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:22,966
You're
'killing two

255
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:24,500
birds
with one stone'.

256
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,166
That
just means you're

257
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:26,899
'solving two

258
00:07:26,899 --> 00:07:28,533
problems
with one action'.

259
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:29,566
Here, the need

260
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:30,866
to
commute to work

261
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,500
and the
need to get your

262
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,600
daily
exercise.

263
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,866
So while
the number of

264
00:07:35,866 --> 00:07:37,399
journeys
by bike

265
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,300
in
London is rising,

266
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,600
they still
only represent 5%

267
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:44,933
of
journeys made each day.

268
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,666
Compare
that with the Danish

269
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,166
capital,
Copenhagen,

270
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,366
where
that figure

271
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:51,100
is
closer to 49%.

272
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:53,266
Half of
journeys

273
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:54,866
are made
by bike.

274
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,199
And another
way of measuring

275
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,233
the popularity

276
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,000
of
something like cycling -

277
00:08:00,433 --> 00:08:02,633
how many
bike trips are made

278
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,500
per
person per day

279
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:05,566
as an average?

280
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:06,600
Despite the

281
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,100
increase
I'm describing,

282
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,266
the number
of bike trips per

283
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,000
person
per day in London

284
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:15,533
is still
only 0.14.

285
00:08:15,866 --> 00:08:17,399
Compare
that to Amsterdam,

286
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,233
the
location of my near

287
00:08:19,233 --> 00:08:21,066
misses with
people on bikes.

288
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,166
Well, in
Amsterdam, the

289
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,199
number of bike

290
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,399
trips
per person

291
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:28,266
per day
is 0.9.

292
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,066
That's
really high, isn't it?

293
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,699
It means
that on average,

294
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,398
nearly
every single

295
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,000
person in
Amsterdam

296
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,433
makes a one

297
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,700
bike
trip per day.

298
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,399
The
problems with cycling?

299
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,266
Well,
the obvious ones -

300
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:43,232
it's much
more practical

301
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,633
where
the land is

302
00:08:44,633 --> 00:08:46,066
relatively
flat.

303
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,299
If you
live in a

304
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,766
place
with steep hills,

305
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:51,100
cycling is
only practical if

306
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
you're
very fit.

307
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,366
Or maybe
the other

308
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,266
way to
look at it,

309
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:55,966
the
population of such a

310
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:58,266
place
could become a fit

311
00:08:58,866 --> 00:09:00,433
by being
made to cycle more.

312
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,666
People
aren't going to like

313
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,566
that
though, are they?

314
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,533
And
cycling to work is fine

315
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,066
if you
have somewhere to

316
00:09:06,066 --> 00:09:08,100
shower
and get changed.

317
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,399
People who
must dress smart

318
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,533
for their work

319
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:13,166
may have
more of a

320
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,333
problem
with cycling.

321
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,766
'Cycle
helmet hair' is a

322
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,399
problem,
I can tell you!

323
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,266
But more
seriously,

324
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:21,100
the number
one problem with

325
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,266
cycling is
of course safety.

326
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,666
That's
S A F E T Y.

327
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,799
The
increase in

328
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,799
cycling
in London

329
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,100
has only come

330
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,766
alongside
a big increase

331
00:09:32,066 --> 00:09:33,399
in the
number of

332
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,433
cycle
lanes available.

333
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,533
Cycle
lanes or cycle paths

334
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:37,500
are pathways

335
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,966
specifically
for bikes.

336
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,266
London's roads

337
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:41,833
are
simply too busy

338
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,333
for it to
be safe cycling.

339
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,200
It's
dangerous for cyclists

340
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,033
to mix with
ordinary traffic.

341
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,066
And even
if you eventually

342
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,799
ban
most of the cars,

343
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,466
taxis,
buses, and vans

344
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,966
delivering
goods to shops

345
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:57,899
are
still going

346
00:09:57,899 --> 00:09:58,899
to be
necessary.

347
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:01,566
These
vehicles pose a threat

348
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:02,533
to the
safety of

349
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:03,566
cyclists
of course.

350
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:05,966
So
continuing to build cycle

351
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:07,866
lanes,
cycle paths

352
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,966
is
essential if we want to

353
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:11,366
see
cycling in London

354
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,666
as part of
the solution to

355
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:14,333
some of our

356
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,933
environmental
problems

357
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,866
and our
transport problems.

358
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,899
Outside big

359
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:20,033
cities
like London,

360
00:10:20,266 --> 00:10:22,366
how
practical is cycling as a

361
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:23,466
mode of
transport?

362
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:24,500
Well,
there are

363
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,899
certain
local journeys

364
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,266
that I
could make by

365
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:28,700
bike if
I needed to.

366
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:30,100
And it
would probably

367
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,799
increase my
level of fitness.

368
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,000
However,
the town I live in

369
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,066
has
hills, it's not flat.

370
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:36,966
There's one

371
00:10:36,966 --> 00:10:38,500
particular
one on the road

372
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,799
back up
to my house

373
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,899
that's
very steep.

374
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,066
It makes
me puff and pant.

375
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,166
That
means I get

376
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:45,399
very out
of breath

377
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,966
when I'm
cycling up there.

378
00:10:46,966 --> 00:10:48,100
So a
greater level

379
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,399
of
fitness is required

380
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
where
there are hills and

381
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,533
that might
be an obstacle.

382
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,899
There's
also a lack of cycle

383
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,533
lanes
outside of the capital.

384
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:58,200
There are
some, but they're

385
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,100
not
consistent.

386
00:10:59,566 --> 00:11:00,799
And
most of the time,

387
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:03,000
cyclists
are expected to ride

388
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:03,899
on the roads

389
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,266
alongside
the traffic.

390
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,633
There just
isn't the money to

391
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,266
build cycle
lanes everywhere.

392
00:11:09,533 --> 00:11:10,899
So
people are naturally

393
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,600
concerned
about safety.

394
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:13,899
And
indeed, my son

395
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:15,866
is just
15 years old.

396
00:11:16,466 --> 00:11:17,333
And only at

397
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,100
Christmas,
one of his friends

398
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,166
had a
serious accident when

399
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,266
he was
knocked off

400
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,566
his bike
by a car.

401
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:25,433
He had to
be hospitalised.

402
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:26,766
Fortunately,
the

403
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:27,866
friend
is better now,

404
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,000
but he was
very lucky not to

405
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,399
be more
seriously injured.

406
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:32,700
Cycling
on roads

407
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,200
carries a
big risk.

408
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,266
One
obvious solution to the

409
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:37,633
lack of
cycle lanes

410
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,766
outside of
the big cities,

411
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,000
cycling
on the pavement.

412
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,500
That's
'pavement',

413
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,600
P A V E M E N T.

414
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,200
That's
the pathway at the

415
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,100
side of
the road

416
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,766
intended
for people on foot,

417
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:52,799
or 'pedestrians'

418
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,166
as we
call them.

419
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:59,100
P E D E S T R I A N S,

420
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,600
'pedestrians'.

421
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:01,766
Currently
the situation in

422
00:12:01,766 --> 00:12:03,333
the UK,
at worst,

423
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,766
it would
be a £30

424
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,366
fine on
the spot.

425
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,433
But actually,

426
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,566
most of
the time,

427
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:10,666
the police
'turn a blind eye'

428
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:12,133
to cycling
on the pavement,

429
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,966
meaning
'they ignore it'.

430
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,000
The
pavements around where I

431
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,766
live are
generally empty.

432
00:12:18,266 --> 00:12:19,299
There
are hardly

433
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,666
any
pedestrians.

434
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,466
If
necessary to

435
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:23,666
make
this safer,

436
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:26,000
you could
increase the fines

437
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,766
for
dangerous cycling

438
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:30,266
and make
it a rule that

439
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:31,733
cyclists
on the pavement

440
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,000
give way
to pedestrians.

441
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:36,433
And
cyclists would be

442
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:38,100
responsible
for judging

443
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,899
whether or
not it's safe to

444
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,399
ride on
the pavement.

445
00:12:41,966 --> 00:12:43,200
Clearly
there are situations

446
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,399
where
it isn't.

447
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,366
Outside of
the big cities in

448
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,933
normal
towns and villages,

449
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,066
there
simply isn't the money

450
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,500
to build cycle

451
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
lanes
everywhere.

452
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,333
But
there are already

453
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,966
pavements
everywhere.

454
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,799
Relaxing
the rules to allow

455
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,366
cyclists

456
00:12:58,366 --> 00:12:59,600
outside
of the capital

457
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:01,266
to cycle
on the pavement

458
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,700
could be
a solution

459
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,166
without
endangering

460
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,399
pedestrians or

461
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,500
people
on foot.

462
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,100
And it
would make a

463
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,000
massive
difference.

464
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,766
I think
that could work.

465
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,966
What do
you think?

466
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,500
Do you
cycle to work?

467
00:13:13,866 --> 00:13:15,200
Do you
enjoy cycling?

468
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:16,866
Or is it
something that you

469
00:13:16,866 --> 00:13:17,666
would
never do?

470
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:18,566
Let us know.

471
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:19,566
Enough
for now.

472
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:20,600
Have a
lovely day.

473
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:22,233
Speak to
you again soon.

474
00:13:22,766 --> 00:13:22,966
Goodbye.
