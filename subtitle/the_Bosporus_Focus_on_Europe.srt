1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,800
This man looks like any other tourist – on
a ferry taking in the sights of Istanbul.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,920
But Yörük Isik is actually observing the
ships. Roughly 50,000 pass through the Bosporus

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:23,210
each year. Nothing special for most observers.
But for him each ship tells a story.

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,789
For example, freight ships like this one often
travel to the Crimean Peninsula that Russia

5
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,140
has annexed. I’m interested in what’s
going on. Are they really headed where they

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,039
say they are? Do they really have the cargo
they say have?

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,850
The Bosporus is one of the most important
straits in the world, connecting the Black

8
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,829
Sea with the Mediterranean. Its 30 kilometers
have always played an important role in the

9
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:59,410
push-and-pull between the world's great powers:
Access to the Black Sea is important to NATO,

10
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,229
and it’s also important for Russia to have
access to the West, to the Aegean and Mediterranean

11
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,680
Sea.
Just a few days later, Isik shows us an example.

12
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,860
When tensions last rose between Russia and
Ukraine, Russian warships passed through the

13
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,210
Bosporus on their way to the Black Sea. He
then discovered a cargo ship that he believes

14
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:27,950
was transporting NATO military equipment to
a Romanian port in the Black Sea.

15
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:35,770
When he returns home, he rushes to post his
discoveries and photos on Twitter. There is

16
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:43,280
a whole community of spotters around the world.
What they point out can be quite sensational

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,670
at times.
The fact that Russia was planning to intervene

18
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:56,350
in the Syrian conflict first became clear
from the increased number of naval ships in

19
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:02,150
the Bosporus. I was able to record just how
they were equipped on deck. Apart from the

20
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,830
Russian naval ships, there were also civilian
cargo ships. We were able to prove they were

21
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:18,370
transporting weapons to Syria.
Apart from arms smuggling, Isik – who runs

22
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,510
his own consultancy analyzing maritime activity
- has also observed shipments of illegal waste

23
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:32,230
or animals being transported in inhumane conditions.
He says it’s not spying, because the information

24
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:41,530
is freely accessible. He’s also not scared
of getting into trouble, at least not yet.

25
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,230
Turkey is going through a difficult phase
when it comes to freedom of opinion. I share

26
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:55,570
my observations openly on Twitter. But I try
to refrain from making any political judgment.

27
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:04,360
Of course, his apartment also has a view across
the Bosporus. And he stays in touch with other

28
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:13,690
spotters 24/7.
We don’t have to warn each other in advance.

29
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:20,230
If a ship sets sail somewhere, I know roughly
when it should arrive here. I know how fast

30
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:30,270
the different models travel.
And so, from his perch, Yörük Isik will

31
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,970
surely be watching the next time history unfolds
at his doorstep.
