1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,743
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,540
- Hello, lovely students,

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,740
and welcome back to English with Lucy.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,640
Today, we're going to talk
about a really annoying word,

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,077
a word that troubles
so many of my students,

6
00:00:22,077 --> 00:00:23,580
"would".

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,880
Ugh, isn't it annoying?

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,600
It's got so many uses.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,433
Well, don't you worry,

10
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,990
because today we are
going to be going through

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,010
the 10 uses of "would".

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,090
We are going to go
through, in immense detail,

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,000
with lots of examples,

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,850
and there will be lots
of exercises in the PDF.

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,890
You will leave this lesson

16
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,210
feeling more confident about
the ways you can use "would".

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,410
I'd like to remind you that, as always,

18
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,120
I have created a free PDF
that goes with this lesson.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,200
It will show you everything
we're going to talk about today,

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,940
in a nice, clear layout,

21
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,820
and it has lots of exercises,

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,810
so you can put what you learned today

23
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,370
into practise later on.

24
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,340

33
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,830
Right, let's get started with the lesson,

34
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,150
and firstly, I want to
do just a little focus

35
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,020
on the pronunciation.

36
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,730
Speakers of certain languages

37
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,100
really struggle with that "wo" sound.

38
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,470
They almost say, "gho",

39
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:44,163
you want to make your lips
nice and round, like this.

40
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,880
Almost as if you're going to kiss,

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,590
but with a little hole. (chuckles)

42
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,147
It's like, you're saying,
"Ooh", but it's even smaller.

43
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,170
"oo".

44
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,933
And then go straight into "ud",

45
00:01:56,933 --> 00:02:00,184
"oo-ud", "wud", "wood", "would"

46
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:02,540
I'm sure that some of
you didn't need that,

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,090
but I'm sure that some
of you did, actually.

48
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,290
Let's start with the first use of would.

49
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,810
We use "would" to make polite requests.

50
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,800
This is one of the most
common phrases using "would",

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,950
when we want to ask
for something politely,

52
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:19,767
we say, "I would like", or "I'd like".

53
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,990
"I'd like a cup of tea, please."

54
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,220
Or "I'd like the scones with jam."

55
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,040
There's a big fight in the UK

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,790
about how to pronounce "scone".

57
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,008
Some say "scone", some say "scon",

58
00:02:33,008 --> 00:02:35,690
scone like cone, scon like gone.

59
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,520
I've always said, "scon".

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,950
If you are a British or
a fan of British culture,

61
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,730
which do you say? "Scon"
or "scone", let me know.

62
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,170
We can also use "would like"

63
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,957
to request things for other people to.

64
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,150
"My husband would like a hot chocolate,

65
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,540
and the New York Times."

66
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,950
That is what he likes.

67
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,970
The first time we ever went
to a posh hotel together,

68
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,590
very early in our relationship,

69
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,250
they said, "What would
you like in the morning?

70
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,760
Which newspaper and hot drink."

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,770
And he just panicked and
said "A hot chocolate

72
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,800
and the New York Times." (laughs)

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,550
The structure of this is
"Subject + would like + object"

74
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,600
or "Subject + would like + to infinitive".

75
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,527
We can also use "would" to
make requests as a question.

76
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:18,640
"Would you close the curtains, please?"

77
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,990
Or "Would you buy me a newspaper?"

78
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,440
Preferably the New York Times,

79
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,570
with a hot chocolate.

80
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,670
Number two, we can use "would"

81
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,500
to make invitations and offers.

82
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,333
For example,

83
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:33,080
if you want to politely offer
someone some food or a drink,

84
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,187
you can say, "Would
you like a cup of tea?"

85
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:36,870
"Would you like a biscuit with that?"

86
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,240
If you want to invite somebody
to an event or a place,

87
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,127
you can say,

88
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,810
"Would you like to come to our
house tomorrow for dinner?"

89
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,340
Or "Would you like to come
with me to the party tonight?"

90
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,440
We can also use "would"
in reported speech.

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,210
I've made a video recently
on reported speech.

92
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:56,670
I'll leave it down there
in the description box.

93
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,720
It's very concise.

94
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,580
I'm sure it will help you,

95
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,190
if you want to look in more detail,

96
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,010
but just as a brief overview,

97
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,710
we can use "would" in reported speech.

98
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,247
In reported speech,

99
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,690
"would" is the past of "will".

100
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:10,407
In direct speech,

101
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:13,240
"I will help you move house." said Robert.

102
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,697
Transforming that into reported speech,

103
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:20,187
"Robert said that he
would help me move house."

104
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:21,779
"Will" changes to "would".

105
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,500
Whenever you see "will" in direct speech,

106
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,870
you can use "would" in reported speech.

107
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,207
Some more examples.

108
00:04:28,207 --> 00:04:29,537
"She said she would come."

109
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:32,517
"They told me they would
finish it by the next day."

110
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:34,820
"I said I would drive
them to the airport."

111
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,190
Number four.

112
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,550
Now this one is really important,

113
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,180
because often students
don't know about this,

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,880
but we use it a lot in speeches, natives.

115
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,150
My husband, Will, uses this all the time,

116
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,470
and it really annoyed me once,

117
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,160
because we filmed a
video for this channel,

118
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,920
and he used "would" all
the time, in this way,

119
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,470
and I think it really
confused some of the viewers.

120
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,080
So I'm really happy to be
talking about it today.

121
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,470
We use "would" to talk about
typical behaviour in the past.

122
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,420
If you didn't know this before,

123
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,910
this is going to make you think,

124
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,730
oh, I understand why they
said "would" all the time now.

125
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,570
We use "would" to talk about
repeated actions in the past.

126
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,267
Habits that we don't do anymore.

127
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,010
"When I was a child,

128
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,690
we would go to France for our holidays."

129
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,550
That was a repeated
action, typical behaviour,

130
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,840
but I'm not a child anymore.

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,857
I don't go to France
anymore for my holidays.

132
00:05:27,857 --> 00:05:30,010
"When Julian was at university,

133
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,960
he would eat ready meals
almost every night."

134
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,120
He doesn't do this anymore.
He's not a student,

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,130
but when he was a student,
this is what he "would" do.

136
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,610
Note that you can't use this
to talk about state verbs,

137
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,990
like "love", "hate", "want" or "have".

138
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,900
For states, we use the
structure "used to" instead.

139
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,560
We don't say, "When I was a
child, I would love chocolate."

140
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,940
We do say, "When I was a child,
I used to love chocolate."

141
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,210
Because "love" is a state verb,

142
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,747
so it doesn't go with "would".

143
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:02,450
"When I was a child, I
used to love chocolate,

144
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,170
but now I don't like it."

145
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,970
What a lie. What a lie.

146
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,100
Number five.

147
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,810
We use "would" to talk about
willingness in the past.

148
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,720
If you want to talk about how
willing or happy someone was

149
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,040
to do something in the
past, you can use "would".

150
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,290
Although we normally use
this in a negative way,

151
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,827
so it's more likely
that we use "wouldn't".

152
00:06:22,827 --> 00:06:25,290
"The shop wouldn't give me a refund,

153
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,340
even though my new phone
is obviously broken."

154
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,950
They weren't willing to,

155
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,560
or "Dave wouldn't carry
any of my boxes for me."

156
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,967
He wasn't willing to.

157
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:37,520
"My parents wouldn't lend me any money,

158
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,790
so I couldn't go out."

159
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,850
Number six,

160
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,820
we also use "would" in
hypothetical situations.

161
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,860
This is another really key one.

162
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,360
Hypothetical situations are situations

163
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,800
that we are imagining.

164
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,717
They're not real.

165
00:06:50,717 --> 00:06:53,479
"The restaurant would be too expensive,

166
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,107
so we won't go there."
(chuckles) Basically.

167
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:58,290
"I would like to live in Spain,

168
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:00,090
because the weather's beautiful."

169
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,937
But I live in England. So I can't.

170
00:07:01,937 --> 00:07:05,050
"I would get seasick
with those huge waves,

171
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,750
so I'm not going on the boat trip."

172
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,840
or "It would be great
to travel more often."

173
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,710
Number seven,

174
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,080
we use "would" in conditional sentences.

175
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,950
I have a full video on the conditionals.

176
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,070
We go into more detail in that video.

177
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,030
I've left a link for you
in the description box,

178
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,280
but just as an overview,
I'll go over it now,

179
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,400
relating to "would".

180
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,720
We use "would" in the second conditional

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,650
to talk about imaginary, impossible,

182
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,290
or very unlikely
situations in the present.

183
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,580
These are similar to the
hypothetical situations

184
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,120
that we spoke about just before,

185
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,040
but with the second
conditional, we use two clauses,

186
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,647
the "If clause" and the "Would clause".

187
00:07:42,647 --> 00:07:47,087
"If I moved to another country,
I would miss my parents."

188
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:49,770
"Claire would take a trip around the world

189
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,530
if she won the lottery."

190
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:53,640
Take a look at the structure
of these sentences,

191
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,110
but pay attention. Okay?

192
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,000
The structure is "If +
subject + past simple comma

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,250
subject + would + the
base form of the verb."

194
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,440
However, that's why I said pay attention.

195
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,690
That little comma, just there,

196
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,130
is only needed if the,
"If clause" comes first,

197
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,130
you can swap the clauses over,

198
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:17,350
and in that case, the comma isn't needed.

199
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,750
I know it seems like such a tiny thing,

200
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,460
but if you're in an exam,
it's really important.

201
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,280
Please also remember, even
though we're using past tenses,

202
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,520
we are imagining things in the present.

203
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,757
Some more examples.

204
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:31,190
"If my children ate all their vegetables,

205
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,720
they would get ice cream."

206
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,860
We're using a comma there,

207
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,597
because the "If clause" comes first.

208
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:38,500
"I would take Spanish
classes if I had time."

209
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,126
The "If clause" comes
second, so there's no comma.

210
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:44,420
"We'd get a Labrador if we
were allowed to get a dog."

211
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,787
I said "We'd", the contraction.
"We would", "We'd".

212
00:08:47,787 --> 00:08:50,930
"If they spoke English, they
would move to New Zealand."

213
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,000
Next up we have the third conditional,

214
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,450
and this is the conditional
that we use to talk about

215
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,150
hypothetical situations in the past.

216
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,780
We often use this structure
to imagine changing the past,

217
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,817
or imagining things happening differently.

218
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:08,370
"I would have called you if I
had known you were at home."

219
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,220
or "If she had helped us, we
would have finished earlier."

220
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,910
Let's look at the structure quickly.

221
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,307
The whole comma situation is very similar.

222
00:09:16,307 --> 00:09:20,700
"If + subject + past perfect comma

223
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,520
subject + would have + past participle."

224
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,700
If the "If clause" comes first,

225
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,780
we need a comma, if it
comes second, we do not.

226
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,567
Let's take a look at some examples.

227
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,210
"If he'd practised more,

228
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,327
he would have passed his driving test."

229
00:09:35,327 --> 00:09:37,460
"She wouldn't have missed her flight

230
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,317
if her alarm had gone off."

231
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,190
"If you'd bought a ticket,

232
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,320
you wouldn't have got a fine."

233
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,070
I said, "You'd", "You had".

234
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,320
Moving on to number eight.

235
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,360
We can use "would" with "wish".

236
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,790
We use "would" with "wish"

237
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,000
to talk about things that we
want people to do or not to do.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,120
We often use it when we're
annoyed by someone's habit

239
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,917
or something they do regularly.

240
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,457
"I wish you wouldn't
leave the door unlocked."

241
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:05,180
"He wishes his dad wouldn't smoke."

242
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,007
The structure is as follows,

243
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:11,447
"Subject + wish + subject + would

244
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:13,617
+ the base form of the verb.

245
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:15,647
"I wish you'd clean the house more often."

246
00:10:15,647 --> 00:10:17,927
"I wish you wouldn't borrow my clothes."

247
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:21,057
"They wish their neighbor's
dog wouldn't bark at night."

248
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,870
"We wish our grandparents
would move closer to us."

249
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,650
Number nine, we use "would"
to talk about preferences.

250
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,360
If we want to talk about what we

251
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,680
or what somebody else
prefers from several options,

252
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,250
we use the phrase "would rather".

253
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,660
This could be a real
situation in the present,

254
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,557
or a hypothetical situation.

255
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:43,190
"I'd rather get a takeaway
today, I'm too tired to cook."

256
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,730
or "Would you rather go to
the cinema or to the theatre?"

257
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,617
The structure is,

258
00:10:47,617 --> 00:10:52,320
"Subject + would rather +
the base form of the verb."

259
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,607
Some more examples,

260
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:55,670
"Would you rather have tea or coffee?"

261
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,800
or "They'd rather not come tonight

262
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,660
because they're not feeling well."

263
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,910
or "Tina would rather meet
us at the restaurant."

264
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,110
Finally, number 10,

265
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,040
we use "would" to give opinions.

266
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,600
When we want to give our
opinion about something,

267
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,440
but we're not sure we're correct

268
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,010
or we want to be really polite,

269
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,270
we can use "would" as
part of some set phrases.

270
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,217
We often say,

271
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:19,437
"I would think",

272
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:20,700
"I would imagine",

273
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,357
or "I would guess".

274
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:25,327
"I'd imagine it's been a
tough few days for him."

275
00:11:25,327 --> 00:11:27,257
"I'd guess he'd want to help."

276
00:11:27,257 --> 00:11:29,450
"I'd think we'd need
to talk to the manager

277
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,970
before we commit to this."

278
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,360
Right. That is it.

279
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,440
The 10 uses for "would".

280
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,250
Now it is time to test your understanding,

281
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,310
by taking the quiz in the PDF.

282
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,240
If you'd like to download that PDF,

283
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,340
the link is in the description box.

284
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,310
You enter your name
and your email address.

285
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,070

286
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,120
and the PDF comes directly to your inbox,

287
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,600
and then you're automatically
signed up to my mailing list.

288
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,710
You get all of my free PDFs each week,

289
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,760
plus all of my news,
offers and course updates.

290
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,060
Don't forget to connect with
me on all of my social media.

291
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,320
I've got my Instagram,

292
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,040
I've got my website,
englishwithlucy.co.uk.

293
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,140
I've got a pronunciation tool there.

294
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,930
Lots of lessons are there too.

295
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,050
If you would like to improve

296
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,550
your listening and vocabulary skills,

297
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,840
then I also have my vlogging channel,

298
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,890
where we document our life here
in the English countryside,

299
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,840
and every single vlog is fully subtitled,

300
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,210
so you can use them
for listening practise,

301
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,460
and to acquire more vocabulary.

302
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,644
I will see you soon for another lesson.

303
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:27,477
Mwah.
(kiss smacks)

304
00:12:27,477 --> 00:12:29,120
Let's look at the structure quickly.

305
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,370
The whole. 
(production cut beeps)

306
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:36,370
She wouldn't have missed her
flight, if her, ah (laughs)

307
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,653
This tiny, tiny lipstick.

308
00:12:40,524 --> 00:12:42,561
(production cut beeps)
Plus subject, plus past. 

309
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,860
(production cut beeps)
The stroke.

310
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:48,458
The structure is, if plus subject plus. 

311
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,291
(production cut beeps)

312
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,874
(upbeat music)
