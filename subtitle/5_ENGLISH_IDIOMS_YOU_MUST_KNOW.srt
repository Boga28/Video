Now, these idioms are right here.

5
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:23,535
We have a foot in the door, a shot in the
dark, allow the dust to settle barking up

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,715
the wrong tree and back against the wall.

7
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,875
Now, what do these idioms mean?

Trust me, you won't regret it.

19
00:01:02,565 --> 00:01:02,894
All right.

20
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,455
Now, let me ask you this.

21
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,425
Are you ready to get started.

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,479
Well, then I'm teacher
tiffani let's jump right in.

23
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,020
All right.

24
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,949
So let's get started with
our first idiom idiom.

25
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:20,960
Number one is a foot in the door after me.

26
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:23,735
A foot in the door.

27
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:25,835
Excellent job.

28
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:32,255
Now, a foot in the door just means
gives people an opportunity to start

29
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:38,405
doing something new, usually in an
area that is difficult to succeed.

30
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:43,605
So, for example, let's say there
was an individual that wanted to

31
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:49,095
get a great job at a very high
paying bank in New York city.

32
00:01:49,545 --> 00:01:56,145
Well, if that individual went to the
number one finance university in America,

33
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:03,184
He, or she would have a foot in the
door for that job because they went to

34
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:09,005
an amazing school and that gives them
a better opportunity to get a good job.

35
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:10,084
Kind of makes sense.

36
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:12,185
We say a foot in the door.

37
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:15,125
Now, let me show you some other
examples that will help you

38
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:17,825
understand how to use this idiom.

39
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:25,695
My internship allowed me to get
my foot in the door for my career.

40
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,765
Now, this is a true statement.

41
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:32,865
And at the end, during story time,
I'll tell you the full story.

42
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,725
Now don't go anywhere at the end.

43
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:36,165
I'll tell you a story about this.

44
00:02:36,195 --> 00:02:42,465
So having an internship helped this
individual, me, get a better job.

45
00:02:42,555 --> 00:02:45,285
All right, we say, get a foot in the door.

46
00:02:45,555 --> 00:02:45,975
Here we go.

47
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:53,565
Example, number two, this isn't
the job you hoped for, but it will

48
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:58,965
help you get a foot in the door,
meaning, Hey, the job you have right

49
00:02:58,965 --> 00:03:01,005
now, I know it's not what you want.

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,450
But it's a stepping stone to
the next job, the next level.

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,870
So we say a foot in the door.

52
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,250
Now what about sentence?

53
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:11,970
Number three?

54
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,150
I worked as a movie extra just
to get my foot in the door.

55
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,850
It gave this individual more
opportunities to get better jobs,

56
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,070
better acting jobs, make sense.

57
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,490
Right.

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:26,970
Okay.

59
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,940
So one more time after me, we have.

60
00:03:29,615 --> 00:03:31,985
A foot in the door.

61
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:33,845
Excellent.

62
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:36,005
All right, now let's go to idiom.

63
00:03:36,155 --> 00:03:37,805
Number two, here we go.

64
00:03:38,345 --> 00:03:40,895
A shot in the dark.

65
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:42,755
Excellent.

66
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:46,985
One more time after me a shot in the dark.

67
00:03:47,825 --> 00:03:48,545
Good job.

68
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:54,195
Now, a shot in the dark just
means an attempt that has very

69
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:56,954
little chance for success.

70
00:03:57,015 --> 00:04:01,214
Now, let me tell you a quick story
that will help you understand this.

71
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:04,935
So, you know, I am a woman.

72
00:04:04,964 --> 00:04:06,584
I look very young though.

73
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,855
I'm a woman that looks very
young, but I actually I'm a

74
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:10,995
little older than you think.

75
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:16,635
So one day I was hanging out with some
friends and there was a young man who was

76
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:19,724
very handsome, but he was in his twenties.

77
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:22,424
Now, he assumed I was in my twenties.

78
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,280
So he approached me and
kind of made a pass at me.

79
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,700
He was trying to say,
Hey, I'm interested now.

80
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,570
Here's the thing.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,030
I was not in my twenties.

82
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,800
I was well in my thirties.

83
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,920
So his attempt was a shot in the dark.

84
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:42,930
There was no way he would succeed in
dating me because he was too young.

85
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,860
Makes sense.

86
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,250
Right.

87
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,950
Again, it was a shot in the dark.

88
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,750
There's very little chance.

89
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:49,995
Honey.

90
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:51,225
You're too young for me.

91
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:53,205
That's the main idea you get it.

92
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:53,925
All right.

93
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:56,685
So we say a shot in the dark.

94
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:59,685
So let me tell you some example sentences.

95
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:00,255
Here we go.

96
00:05:00,855 --> 00:05:06,555
You can look for your key on the
beach, but that's a shot in the dark.

97
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:12,405
Very hard to find your keys in the midst
of all that sand, a shot in the dark.

98
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:14,355
It's starting to make sense, right?

99
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:14,955
Okay.

100
00:05:14,985 --> 00:05:15,885
Let's go to sentence.

101
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:16,305
Number two.

102
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:23,235
The figure he came up with
was really a shot in the dark.

103
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:28,575
Like, come on that that's not
realistic, a shot in the dark.

104
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:33,495
And finally sentence number
three, it was a shot in the dark.

105
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:35,594
I can't believe I was right.

106
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:39,375
So this person thought that
there were little chances of

107
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,295
them being correct or succeeding.

108
00:05:41,935 --> 00:05:42,925
Oh, my goodness.

109
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:43,705
They were right.

110
00:05:44,065 --> 00:05:48,265
So in English we say a shot in the dark.

111
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:52,465
So one more time after
me a shot in the dark.

112
00:05:53,515 --> 00:05:54,055
Excellent.

113
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:57,385
Now a quiz is coming, so
keep paying attention.

114
00:05:57,385 --> 00:05:59,965
I want you to ACE the quiz.

115
00:06:00,205 --> 00:06:00,745
Here we go.

116
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:07,495
Let's go to idiom number three,
allow the dust to settle.

117
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:12,284
Allow the dust to settle.

118
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:14,085
Excellent.

119
00:06:14,085 --> 00:06:18,855
Now you're probably wondering
teacher, what is this about dust?

120
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:19,815
Let me explain.

121
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:28,065
So allow the dust to settle means to
allow a situation to become normal again.

122
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:30,945
So this is what I want
you to imagine right now.

123
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:31,995
Close your eyes.

124
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,125
Just listen to my voice.

125
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,765
Imagine that there was
a rug on the ground.

126
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:41,054
And that rug was full of dust and dirt.

127
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:45,494
So you go and you walk up to the
rug and you pick it up and you

128
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:49,784
shake it to get the dust out of
the rug right now, what happens?

129
00:06:49,905 --> 00:06:55,664
The dust gets all in the air and now it's
hard to see and you have to pause and

130
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:59,294
wait a minute for the dust to settle.

131
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,854
You have to wait for the
situation to become normal again.

132
00:07:04,229 --> 00:07:05,429
It makes sense, right?

133
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,989
You kind of visualize now.

134
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,460
Oh yes.

135
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,659
The dust in the air.

136
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:12,539
You need to wait for it to leave the air.

137
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,739
So the same idea goes for this
idiom, allow the dust to settle.

138
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:20,099
So let's look at some examples
sentences that will help you

139
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,989
understand this a little bit more.

140
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,609
First one, I'm going to
allow the dust to settle.

141
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:32,170
Before I try talking to her again,
that means something happened.

142
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:36,039
There was a challenge or an issue,
and now things are a little bit

143
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,710
strange, like that dust in the air.

144
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,800
And you want things to go back to normal.

145
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:48,840
Hey, I'm going to let the dust settle
before I tried talking to her again.

146
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,680
Makes sense, right?.

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,390
You're seeing it now, even visually.

148
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,810
Right.

149
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,380
. All right, so let's check
out sentence number two here.

150
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,340
My mom said I needed to
allow the dust to settle.

151
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,670
Before I ask my dad to adopt a dog.

152
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,140
Makes sense.

153
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,850
Ooh, wait a second.

154
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,490
Let things go back to normal.

155
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:12,010
Before you ask your dad for a dog.

156
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,360
All right, here we go.

157
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,050
Sentence.

158
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:18,580
Number three, she waited
for the dust to settle.

159
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,780
Then began to express her feelings to her.

160
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,740
Fiance.

161
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:28,540
Makes sense again, waiting
until things go back to normal.

162
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,434
Before you do something in English,
the idiom is allow the dust to settle.

163
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:35,694
Make sense?

164
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:36,864
You're smart.

165
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:37,434
Here we go.

166
00:08:37,614 --> 00:08:41,304
Let's keep going to idiom number four.

167
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:44,034
So again, we had idiom number three.

168
00:08:44,214 --> 00:08:46,224
Let's move on to idiom.

169
00:08:46,435 --> 00:08:47,844
Number four, here we go.

170
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,000
Back against the wall.

171
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,240
Wait a minute, teacher, what does that
mean to have your back against the wall?

172
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:03,600
Now this means to be in a very
bad situation or position,

173
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,460
a very bad situation.

174
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,200
So let me tell you really quickly when
I had my back against the wall, you see

175
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,940
I've been teaching for a long time, but
at the very beginning of my business,

176
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,830
when I started, I didn't have any.

177
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,310
My credit card was maxed out.

178
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,550
So my back was against the wall.

179
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,670
I had to figure out how
to bring in more money.

180
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,150
Again, I had my back against the wall.

181
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,070
I was in a bad situation.

182
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,480
Makes sense, right?

183
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,970
Maybe you've been in a bad situation.

184
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:40,120
You had your back against the wall.

185
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,140
Make sense?

186
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:41,680
All right.

187
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,530
Let's check out some example sentences.

188
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,190
Here we go.

189
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,099
The lawsuit had him with
his back against the wall.

190
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,329
Makes sense.

191
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,290
All right.

192
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,620
Sentence, number two, we had
our backs against the wall, but

193
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,410
somehow we managed to win the game.

194
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,360
Makes sense.

195
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,810
Right?

196
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,920
All right, here we go.

197
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,530
Now again, all of these
examples you can find.

198
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,610
If you go to my website,
SpeakEnglishWithTiffani.com and go to

199
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,680
the section that has the YouTube lesson.

200
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,340
So don't worry.

201
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,440
You can see all of these
examples sentences.

202
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,280
Here we go.

203
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:26,020
I was in a foreign country without a
phone and my back was against the wall.

204
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,045
It makes sense, right?

205
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:32,185
That's a horrible situation
to be in overseas in a foreign

206
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:34,495
country without a phone.

207
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:37,854
Your back will be against the wall.

208
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:38,905
Makes sense.

209
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:39,984
You're smart.

210
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:43,435
All right, now let's go to our next idiom.

211
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:43,915
Here we go.

212
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:44,814
Let's go to idiom.

213
00:10:44,964 --> 00:10:45,834
Number five.

214
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,574
Remember your quiz is coming up.

215
00:10:47,574 --> 00:10:50,035
So I hope you are paying attention.

216
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:50,755
Here we go.

217
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:51,295
Idiom.

218
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:54,775
Number five, barking up the wrong tree.

219
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:01,060
Good one more time after me
barking up the wrong tree.

220
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,830
Excellent.

221
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:10,030
Now this just means to pursue, to
move forward on a mistaken line

222
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,180
of thought or course of action.

223
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,000
It's like, Ooh, I don't think that's the
way you want to go or I don't think that's

224
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,160
the direction we're trying to go in.

225
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,340
You are barking up the wrong tree.

226
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:24,880
All right.

227
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,590
Now again, these idioms.

228
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,400
Oh my goodness.

229
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,840
We use them all the time.

230
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,400
So I get excited because I want you to
sound more like a native English speaker.

231
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:34,150
So here we go.

232
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:37,750
Let's look at some example,
sentences, sentence.

233
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:38,740
Number one.

234
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,130
If he thinks I'm paying for him,
he's barking up the wrong tree.

235
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,010
Now this is something that a
woman can say on the first date.

236
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,439
You know, they'd go out to dinner.

237
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,950
Candle light, beautiful restaurant.

238
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,380
The meal comes, oh, it looks delicious.

239
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:02,080
And when the meal is over, the bill
comes and the guy looks at her and

240
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,180
she looks at the guy and she says,
oh, he thinks I'm paying for him.

241
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:07,870
No, no.

242
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,330
He's barking up the wrong tree.

243
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,680
Makes sense.

244
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,040
Right?

245
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,050
Oh, that's the wrong train of thought.

246
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,180
That's the wrong idea.

247
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:18,564
We say barking up the wrong tree.

248
00:12:18,865 --> 00:12:21,015
I think some ladies understood that one.

249
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:21,535
Here we go.

250
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:22,495
Sentence.

251
00:12:22,495 --> 00:12:26,035
Number two, she's barking
up the wrong tree.

252
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:31,944
If she thinks that will solve the
problem, she has the wrong idea.

253
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:34,074
That's not going to solve anything.

254
00:12:34,074 --> 00:12:37,645
She's barking up the wrong tree.

255
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:38,305
Makes sense.

256
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:38,725
Right?

257
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:41,064
I know you're taking notes
and I'm so proud of you.

258
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:41,485
Here we go.

259
00:12:41,785 --> 00:12:43,074
Last example, sentence.

260
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,640
The investors kept
barking up the wrong tree.

261
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,110
Hey guys, come on.

262
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,150
This is not the right direction.

263
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,470
You guys are barking up.

264
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,490
The wrong tree.

265
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,930
Makes sense, right.

266
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,690
Again, barking up the wrong tree.

267
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,790
All right now real quick.

268
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,830
Before we have our quiz, I want
to go over them real quick.

269
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,700
Before our quiz.

270
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,970
I want you to ACE the quiz foot in
the door, giving an opportunity.

271
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:18,670
Number two shot in the dark and attempt
that has little chance of success.

272
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:22,300
Number three, allow the dust to settle.

273
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,020
Remember that one, let
things go back to normal.

274
00:13:26,499 --> 00:13:33,729
Number four, back against the wall to
be in a very bad situation and number

275
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,550
five, barking up the wrong tree.

276
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,989
Hey, that's a mistake.

277
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,489
That's not the right way to think.

278
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,350
Are you ready?

279
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,890
It's time for your quiz.

280
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,220
Now you are going to have five
seconds for each question.

281
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,030
I hope you're ready.

282
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,540
I'm going to give you the
question you need to fill in the

283
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,700
blank with the correct idiom.

284
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,300
Remember you've learned them,
you know them, you can sound

285
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:00,340
like a native English speaker.

286
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,120
Here we go.

287
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,850
Question number one,
you have five seconds.

288
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,230
Here we go.

289
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:13,960
She doesn't like guys with long hair,
so I think you may be time starts now.

290
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,100
Time.

291
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:18,610
All right.

292
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,810
What's the answer.

293
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,200
Come on.

294
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,310
You know it what's the answer.

295
00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:22,780
Yes.

296
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,630
Barking up the wrong tree.

297
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,650
Excellent job.

298
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,490
Very good.

299
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,050
All right, now let's go
to question number two.

300
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,430
Again, you have five seconds.

301
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,910
Here we go.

302
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,800
Question number two.

303
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:43,765
Her "blank" after she
lost her biggest client.

304
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:45,535
Woo.

305
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:47,845
Her blank.

306
00:14:49,095 --> 00:14:51,945
She lost her biggest client.

307
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:53,295
This one is tricky.

308
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:53,865
You ready?

309
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:54,405
Here we go.

310
00:14:54,405 --> 00:14:54,975
Five seconds.

311
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:00,015
All right.

312
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:01,155
What's the answer?

313
00:15:01,155 --> 00:15:02,115
This one was tricky.

314
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,515
Her yes.

315
00:15:04,665 --> 00:15:09,225
Back was against the wall after
she lost her biggest client.

316
00:15:09,285 --> 00:15:09,825
Excellent.

317
00:15:09,855 --> 00:15:10,575
All right, here we go.

318
00:15:10,845 --> 00:15:11,445
Number three.

319
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:13,885
Now remember you have five seconds.

320
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:16,825
My mother was furious.

321
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:23,065
So I decided to, before I asked
for a new phone, what idiom goes

322
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:24,745
here, which idiom did we learn?

323
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:26,454
That matches this one, five seconds.

324
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:27,675
Here we go.

325
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:33,194
All right.

326
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:33,944
What's the answer?

327
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:34,305
Come on.

328
00:15:34,305 --> 00:15:34,964
I know you know it.

329
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:35,895
What's the answer?

330
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:36,555
Yes.

331
00:15:37,349 --> 00:15:39,790
Allow the dust to settle.

332
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:40,780
Excellent job.

333
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,530
Here we go.

334
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:49,119
Question number four, the project
was hopeless, so his suggestion

335
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,569
was really five seconds.

336
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,200
Here we go.

337
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:57,819
Time.

338
00:15:57,849 --> 00:15:58,150
All right.

339
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,810
What's the answer.

340
00:15:58,810 --> 00:15:59,200
Come on.

341
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,349
I know, you know it a shot in the dark.

342
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,069
Excellent.

343
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:04,329
Very good man.

344
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:07,329
You learned these idioms so fast.

345
00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:07,960
All right, here we go.

346
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:16,420
And number five, last one who I
think this conference will really

347
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,260
help you get your five seconds.

348
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,040
Here we go.

349
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:21,910
Five seconds

350
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:26,980
Time!

351
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,230
What's the answer?

352
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:29,490
Yes!

353
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,470
Your foot in the door, man.

354
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,240
You are awesome.

355
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,980
Excellent job.

356
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:39,040
You did such an amazing job.

357

374
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:34,784
you still.

375
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,129
You know what time it is.

376
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,030
Here we go.

377
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,660
It's story time.

378
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,020
Hey, I said it's story time.

379
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,860
All right.

380
00:17:48,129 --> 00:17:52,030
Now I promised you guys that I
would tell you the story about how

381
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:59,080
my internship helped me get a foot
in the door for my job at NASA.

382
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,680
All right.

383
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,250
Now.

384
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,910
So what happened was when I
was in university again, I was

385
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,470
a very hardworking student.

386
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,720
I actually paid my way through school.

387
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,590
I had three jobs when I was in
university because I didn't want my

388
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,330
parents to have to pay for anything.

389
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:19,150
So one of the jobs that I had when
I was in university was actually an

390
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,420
internship and it was connected to.

391
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:23,750
That's right.

392
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,450
My internship was with NASA and one of
their contractors, great internship.

393
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,590
I learned a lot.

394
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,270
Gained a  lot of experience.

395
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:38,240
So I, again, thought to myself, Hey, this
internship is going to help me get my foot

396
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,399
in the door so that I can get a great job.

397
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,159
So fast forward my senior year,
last year of university, and

398
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,500
we're moving closer to graduation.

399
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,240
But I hadn't gotten a job offer yet.

400
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,310
So I was getting a little nervous again.

401
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,630
I had worked so hard.

402
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:59,080
I thought I had done well
in my internship, but I

403
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,700
wasn't getting any emails.

404
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:04,510
I wasn't getting any messages
related to job offers.

405
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:09,670
So graduation day came, I graduated still.

406
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,910
No offers packed my things.

407
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,950
My parents came down to my university.

408
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,550
It was an Alabama.

409
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:22,420
Hacked my stuff, put it in the cars and
we drove back up to Maryland weeks, went

410
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:27,820
by about, well, two weeks went by still,
no offers, no emails, no phone calls.

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,390
And I was starting to get a little
bit nervous because I had worked

412
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,810
so hard at the internship, but
they weren't offering me a job.

413
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:38,754
So I said, okay, Lord, you know,
as you guys know, I'm a Christian.

414
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:39,834
I started praying a lot.

415
00:19:39,834 --> 00:19:42,745
I said, maybe I have to look
for a job somewhere else.

416
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:48,534
So I started looking for other jobs and
I remember this, like it was yesterday.

417
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:53,605
I was walking in my house and the
phone rang; our house phone rang.

418
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:59,725
I walked into my parents room where the
house phone was and I sat on their bed.

419
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:00,804
I said, hello?

420
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:04,175
I said, hi, can we speak
to Tiffani Claiborne?

421
00:20:04,465 --> 00:20:05,545
I said, okay, sure.

422
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:06,385
You know, it's me.

423
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,495
And they said, how are you?

424
00:20:09,075 --> 00:20:10,014
I'm fine.

425
00:20:10,045 --> 00:20:12,774
They said, you know, how did
you enjoy your internship?

426
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,925
And that's when I realized it
was connected to the internship.

427
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:18,055
So I got a little bit nervous again.

428
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:23,754
I still remember this, even though this
was literally 17 years ago, I was sitting

429
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:25,465
on the bed and my heart started to race.

430
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:27,835
I said, I really enjoyed the internship.

431
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:29,455
They said, yes, you
actually did pretty well.

432
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:30,595
I said, oh, thank you so much.

433
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,325
And I waited and I waited.

434
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:37,915
They said, well, Tiffani, um, did
you enjoy your time there a lot?

435
00:20:37,915 --> 00:20:38,995
I said, yeah, I really did.

436
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:41,815
I enjoyed my coworkers and
what I learned and what I did.

437
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:46,705
I said, okay, would you like
to keep working with us now?

438
00:20:46,735 --> 00:20:49,355
I didn't want to scream on
the phone, but I was excited.

439
00:20:49,355 --> 00:20:53,275
I said yes, that that would be amazing.

440
00:20:53,305 --> 00:20:55,015
I would appreciate that opportunity.

441
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:57,355
You know, when you're on the
phone for a professional call,

442
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:58,275
you know, you have to change.

443
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,160
That would be awesome.

444
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,820
I would really appreciate if you
all gave me that opportunity.

445
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,980
Meanwhile, inside my heart, I
was like, Jesus, come on now,

446
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,450
but I didn't want to do all that.

447
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:12,715
So I said, yes, that would be amazing.

448
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:13,765
Thank you so much.

449
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:15,405
So the phone call continued.

450
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:15,985
They said, okay.

451
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:20,665
So what we're going to do is we're going
to send you an offer via email and you

452
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:23,185
please let us know if that offer is okay.

453
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:25,615
They're talking about the month,
you know, the money amount of money.

454
00:21:25,645 --> 00:21:27,975
My, uh, my I'm salary.

455
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:29,575
So I got off the phone.

456
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,615
Of course I immediately called my parents.

457
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:37,135
So of course I got a job offer again
with your family, you can be honest,

458
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,185
you know, the way you want to speak.

459
00:21:38,215 --> 00:21:38,545
Right.

460
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:43,255
So I talked to my parents and then I
got the email and the offer amount.

461
00:21:43,255 --> 00:21:47,005
I said, yes, Lord, the salary was good.

462
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,135
It was comparable for my experience.

463
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:51,265
It matched where I was going to be living.

464
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:52,825
It was amazing.

465
00:21:52,975 --> 00:21:57,534
And then that moment I realized,
man, That internship really

466
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:59,395
did give me a foot in the door.

467
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:04,194
I now had a job with NASA
because of the internship I

468
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:05,834
had while I was in university.

469
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:08,685
I will never forget
the day the offer came.

470
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:12,135
I will never forget that day because
there were so many weeks and months

471
00:22:12,284 --> 00:22:16,274
prior to that, that I just didn't
think I was going to get a job offer.

472
00:22:16,665 --> 00:22:18,524
Maybe you've experienced
something similar.

473
00:22:18,794 --> 00:22:20,264
You're waiting for a call.

474
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:23,024
Or maybe you did something that
you thought would get your foot

475
00:22:23,024 --> 00:22:24,554
in the door for a specific job.

476
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,504
Then there was this period of waiting.

477
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:28,044
Now.

478
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:31,675
I appreciated everything that
happened during my time at NASA.

479
00:22:31,675 --> 00:22:35,995
I loved the job, but as you all know, I
left and I became an English teacher, but

480
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:37,915
yes, hopefully you understood the story.

481
00:22:37,915 --> 00:22:38,905
Hopefully you liked it.

482
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:43,399
And hopefully now you even
mastered get your foot in the door.

483
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,290
All right, guys, I will see you next week.

484
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,600

100 English idioms right here.
