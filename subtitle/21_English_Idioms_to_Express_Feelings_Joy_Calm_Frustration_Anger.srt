1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,240
With English, idioms, you can
precisely express your feelings.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,400
You can even add finesse or nuance,

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,039
no matter whether you're feeling
joyful, calm, or frustrated. Now,

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,920
of course you can use
the words, joy, calm,

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,870
and frustration to describe
how you're feeling. However,

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,230
in this lesson today,

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,750
I'm going to share with you 21
English idioms to help bring

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,670
sharp accuracy to how you express
the way you're feeling in English.

9
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:32,770
Moreover,

10
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,390
it will allow you to increase the level
of sophistication in your vocabulary.

Confident English lessons.

22
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:34,709
Now let's get back to those 21 English
idioms to help you express your feelings

23
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,543
in English.

24
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,830
What makes idiom so exciting
is that they allow us to

25
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,390
describe something in a precise
and creative way. Not only that,

26
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,950
but idioms also help
us to be concise in our

27
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:50,790
communication.

28
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,100
The right idiom can help us describe
an extremely complicated emotion

29
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,060
in just a few words. For example,

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,420
if I say that I'm feeling
frustrated that word doesn't fully

31
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:09,340
express whether something is
simply under my skin or whether

32
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:14,050
I'm nearly ready to flip my
lid. These are two idioms.

33
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:15,650
You're going to learn more about today.

34
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,610
Recently members in my Confident Women
Community explored more than 30 idioms

35
00:02:21,611 --> 00:02:26,450
that help us to express feelings
of joy, calm, frustration,

36
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,760
and even anger. And for
you in this lesson today,

37
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:34,480
I've refined that list to
21 English idioms together.

38
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,760
We're going to explore how these English
idioms can be useful to you as you

39
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,800
describe your feelings and we'll
discover their subtlies as well as we go

40
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:44,840
through this lesson together.

41
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,910
If you begin to wonder how you can
remember all of these idioms and

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,510
use them effectively in
English conversations,

43
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:57,030
be sure to stick with me because I'll
share my top strategies to learn.

44
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,760
And remember at the end of this lesson,

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,040
let's start today with four idioms that
are used to describe a general state

46
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:09,080
of positivity. The
first one to feel sunny,

47
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,440
if you're feeling sunny, it means to
be outwardly cheerful and optimistic.

48
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,990
This typically happens when things
in our life line up in a way

49
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,910
that make us feel pleased
and hopeful. For example,

50
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,830
you might be the kind of
person who loves to brainstorm.

51
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,870
You love sharing ideas and exploring
possibilities. If that sounds like you,

52
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:35,590
then this sentence might be
a great example to follow.

53
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,540
Hannah felt sunny as
she brainstormed ideas,

54
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,780
similar to feeling sunny.

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,620
You might describe yourself as
feeling upbeat when you're feeling

56
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,220
upbeat. It means that you're feeling
full of hope, optimism, and joy.

57
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,570
Now, as I said, this is very
similar to the idiom to feel sunny,

58
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,450
but there is just a slight difference.

59
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,530
A person can feel sunny,

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,010
feel generally optimistic and not
draw a lot of attention to themselves.

61
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,330
It might be a general feeling of
joy that they have internally.

62
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,080
However, when we describe
ourselves as feeling upbeat,

63
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,240
it typically means that we are
exhibiting our hope, our joy,

64
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:26,839
our optimism in a lively
expressive way. For example,

65
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,880
if you hear your favorite song, come
on the radio while you're driving,

66
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,630
you might turn it up and say, oh,
this song always makes me feel upbeat.

67
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,110
And when you do that,

68
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,710
it's likely that there's going to be
some outward sign of that upbeat feeling.

69
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,630
Our third idiom for general
positivity is to be in good spirits

70
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,589
when you're in good spirits,

71
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,580
it means to feel lighthearted
or cheerful while maintaining

72
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:54,339
balance. For example,

73
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,180
you may be working on a difficult
project at work and with any project,

74
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,580
there are bound to be moments of
stress or missed deadlines. However,

75
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,260
despite those potential obstacles,

76
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,210
you still feel that overall
sense of cheerfulness.

77
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:17,130
So a great example sentence you could
use might be the team was in good

78
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,210
spirits as they approached
the project deadline.

79
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,450
And number four for general
positivity is to be in good humor.

80
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:25,920
Once again,

81
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,600
this means to have a general
sense of cheerfulness or to be

82
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:32,640
amicable, to be agreeable.

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:37,760
You'll often hear this idiom used
when someone is feeling particularly

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,800
cheerful after a difficult
or stressful situation.

85
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,029
For example, if someone, you know,

86
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,230
recently had a major operation,

87
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,220
if they come through that operation
and go through their recovery process,

88
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,240
feeling cheerful and
optimistic, you might say,

89
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,120
my mother seemed to be in good humor.

90
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,000
As we stroll through the
garden after her surgery.

91
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,839
Now let's continue to our next section
where we'll focus on five idioms that we

92
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,720
typically use to describe feelings of joy.

93
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,029
When you feel so happy that
you nearly jump into the air,

94
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,029
or maybe you actually
do jump into the air,

95
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,510
you can use the idiom to leap
or jump for joy. For example,

96
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,310
she couldn't help, but leap for
joy when they offered her the job.

97
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,180
Can you think of the last time you felt
so happy that you were ready to jump

98
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,540
into the air? How would you use
that idiom to describe that moment,

99
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,660
write down an example
sentence. And if you want,

100
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,740
you can share it with me
in the comments as well.

101
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,820
Our second idiom for describing
feelings of joy is to

102
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,410
burst with joy. Let's talk about that.

103
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,450
Verb burst for a moment.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,250
Imagine a balloon that is full of air.

105
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,130
What's going to happen to that balloon.

106
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,850
If you take a small pin or
needle and you poke the balloon,

107
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,090
it's going to burst, right?

108
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,720
This idiom figuratively describes
that feeling of having so

109
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,480
much happiness, so much joy that
you feel that you're about to burst.

110
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,973
For example,

111
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:27,080
my niece was bursting with joy as
she got ready for her first day of

112
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:30,870
school, the next one to weep for joy.

113
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,030
This means to cry out of
pure happiness. For example,

114
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,790
if you haven't seen a family member
for a particularly long time,

115
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,950
that first moment, when
you see your family member,

116
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,630
when you're able to give them a hug,

117
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:52,180
you might be overwhelmed with joy
to the point that you start crying

118
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,330
to cry for joy. For example,

119
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,690
it was hard not to weep for joy.

120
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,210
When I saw my brother for the
first time, after four years,

121
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,600
our fourth idiom to describe feelings
of joy is to be over the moon.

122
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,400
Simply put this means
to be extremely pleased.

123
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,120
For example, we were over the moon. When
we found out we were moving to France,

124
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,040
similar to feeling over the
moon is to be on cloud nine.

125
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,190
When you're on cloud nine,

126
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:28,910
it means to be overwhelmed
with feelings of happiness,

127
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,670
satisfaction and excitement. For example,

128
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:38,070
Rachel felt like she was on cloud nine.
When she finally bought her dream house.

129
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,620
Our next three idioms are focused
specifically on feelings of

130
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:45,340
calm or tranquility.

131
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,820
And the first one is to be
even keeled when you're even

132
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,800
keeled, you're balanced
well adjusted and calm.

133
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,760
Think for a moment about a coworker
or maybe a boss that you've had,

134
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,000
who always stays calm and logical,

135
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,360
no matter how stressful a
situation might be at work.

136
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,429
You could always describe that
person as having an even keeled

137
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,910
manner or an even keeled characteristic.

138
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:22,950
And if you want an example
sentence, you might say my coworker,

139
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,750
Susan is always even keeled,

140
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:29,630
no matter how stressful the
situation might be in our office.

141
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,300
The second idiom that we can use to
describe feelings of calm is to be as

142
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,980
cool as a cucumber.

143
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,020
Have you ever gone to a spa and
had slices of cool cucumbers

144
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,300
placed over your eyes?
Why do they do that?

145
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,980
It brings an immediate
sense of coolness and calm.

146
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:53,010
And this is a wonderful idiom to use.

147
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:57,450
When you want to describe
someone as being perfectly calm,

148
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,570
perfectly composed.
Despite the circumstances,

149
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,650
for example, as she got ready to
go on stage for her presentation,

150
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,360
Carrie was as cool as a cucumber
and our third idiom for describing

151
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:18,080
those moments of staying
calm is to keep one's cool.

152
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,280
I love this idiom to keep
one's cool means to stay calm

153
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,520
in a difficult situation.

154
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,429
This is particularly important for anyone
in the customer service industry and

155
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,910
a great example sentence. You
could use what this idiom might be.

156
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,270
I felt frustrated by the
constant questioning,

157
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,230
but I kept my cool all the same. Okay.

158
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,980
So far we've had idioms to
describe general feelings of

159
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:48,814
positivity,

160
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,420
idioms to describe feeling
joyful and idioms for feeling

161
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,483
calm.

162
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,820
Now we're going to transition into idioms
that we might use to describe moments

163
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,540
of frustration or even anger.

164
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,850
Let's start with three English idioms
we can use to describe those moments

165
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,650
of irritation, annoyance,

166
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:15,850
or frustration when things get difficult
or don't go the way we expected.

167
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,809
The first one is to get under one's skin.

168
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,920
This is one that I use at the very
beginning of this lesson today.

169
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,200
If something gets under your skin,

170
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,600
it means that you are annoyed
by someone's behavior or

171
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:35,640
their communication.
Here's an example sentence,

172
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,400
despite trying to stay calm,

173
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,070
her teenage daughter's behavior
got under Elaine's skin.

174
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,270
Think for a moment
about behaviors at work.

175
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,670
Is there anything that someone
does that irritates you that

176
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,120
annoys you? If so,

177
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,000
try using this idiom to describe it,

178
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,520
describe what happens and how
you feel using the idiom to

179
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:08,440
get under your skin after you do that,
share it with me in the comments below.

180
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,990
And now let's go onto the second
idiom to describe frustration

181
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,550
to push one's buttons. If
someone pushes your buttons,

182
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,670
it means that they do something or
say something in a way that aims

183
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,470
to get some kind of a strong
reaction or an emotional response.

184
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,980
Typically negative. For
example, when I was younger,

185
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,460
my brother knew exactly how to push
my buttons and get me in trouble

186
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,020
with our parents. And number three,

187
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,700
to be on edge earlier,

188
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,780
I used an example of someone
remaining as cool as a cucumber just

189
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,570
before they go on stage
to give a presentation.

190
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,210
The opposite of that
might be to be on edge.

191
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,090
When you're feeling on edge, it
means that you're feeling nervous,

192
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,490
anxious, irritated, or frustrated.

193
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,120
And usually this is exhibited
in some kind of behavior like

194
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,280
pacing back and forth.

195
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,480
So just like I use the idiom cool as
a cucumber to describe how someone

196
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,559
appeared just before
giving a presentation,

197
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,160
I could use this one as well
as she prepared to go on stage

198
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,230
and give her presentation.

199
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,710
Carrie appeared to be on edge
as she paced back and forth.

200
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,950
Now that you have idioms to describe
feelings of frustration in English,

201
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,150
let's move on to what you might say.

202
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,140
When those feelings of
frustration, transition into anger,

203
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,900
we have three idioms. We're going
to learn focused on feeling anger.

204
00:13:50,901 --> 00:13:55,500
And then we're going to move further
with three idioms that we use to describe

205
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,740
uncontrollable anger. So when
things really reach their limit,

206
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,370
our first English idiom to
describe feeling angry is to

207
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,250
lose one's temper or simply to lose it.

208
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,210
If you lose your temper,

209
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,929
it means you lose your
composure and you visibly show

210
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,520
anger. You're no longer able
to keep it inside. For example,

211
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,120
my mom lost it. When she
found out I failed my test.

212
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,160
Can you think of a moment when
you lost it? In other words,

213
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,880
you lost your composure.

214
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,280
You are no longer able to
keep your cool and instead

215
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:42,630
you showed your anger. If
you've had a moment like that,

216
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,270
try using that idiom in an
example, sentence of your own.

217
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,640
Our second idiom for describing
feelings of anger doesn't necessarily

218
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,160
mean that you exhibit anger.
You don't necessarily show it,

219
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:01,360
but you do take some kind of
action to help you stop those

220
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:02,400
feelings of anger.

221
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:08,040
The idiom is to be triggered
and we use this to describe our

222
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,070
emotional response to
something disturbing.

223
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:16,430
It might be something disturbing that
we see on media or at a social event.

224
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,230
It could also be something that
brings back a negative memory

225
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,323
or experience.

226
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,140
So the moment that disturbing
image comes on the computer screen,

227
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,380
or the moment that we
hear something disturbing,

228
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,580
we have this immediate angry
response. And as a result,

229
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,660
we might walk away from the situation
or turn off the TV or stop watching a

230
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:43,100
movie. For example,

231
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,890
watching the movie triggered me
and I couldn't finish the rest.

232
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,770
I had to turn it off English idiom.

233
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:55,250
Number three for describing
feelings of anger is to lash out.

234
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,010
This means to suddenly attack someone,

235
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,090
either physically or verbally
out of anger. For example,

236
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,480
she lashed out when she
found out she lost her job.

237
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,720
Before we get into a few final tips,

238
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,160
I'd like to share with you on how you
can learn and remember these English

239
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:20,520
idioms so that you're able
to easily use them in English

240
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,354
conversations.

241
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,190
I want to finish with three more
idioms and here we're going to the very

242
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,110
extreme of strong anger.

243
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,990
And the first idiom we'll
use here is to blow a fuse.

244
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,710
This simply means to
become extremely angry.

245
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:40,323
For example,

246
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:45,900
Jamie's aunt blew a fuse when she
found out the family wasn't coming

247
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:50,700
over for Thanksgiving this year. Now,
before I share my final two idioms,

248
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:55,700
I want to pause here for a moment
and reflect again on why idioms

249
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:00,420
are so helpful at the beginning of
this lesson. I highlighted that, yes,

250
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:04,210
we can use the words joyful, angry,

251
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,090
or frustrated to describe
our feelings. However, again,

252
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:13,089
if I use the word frustration,
I felt frustrated at work today.

253
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,290
It doesn't really tell you
the extent of my frustration

254
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,280
was I mildly frustrated and mildly angry,

255
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,080
maybe something got under my skin a bit,

256
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,840
or was I frustrated enough
that I became so angry

257
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,320
to blow a fuse.

258
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,670
This is where idioms become
particularly helpful.

259
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:42,070
Adding that sophistication
and nuance to our speech.

260
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,390
Now let's finish up with our last two
idioms and some tips on how to remember

261
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:50,760
these easily. So you can use them
in your English conversations.

262
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,359
The next idiom is to go ballistic.

263
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:59,800
This one is quite strong and
even has this violent feeling to

264
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:00,634
it.

265
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,080
It means to become extremely angry and

266
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,109
to show signs of rage. For example,

267
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,230
fans went ballistic when they found
out their favorite player was cut

268
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,270
from the team. And finally,

269
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,750
our last idiom for today is to flip a lid.

270
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:26,619
I love the imagery of this idiom,
even though it's quite negative.

271
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,420
I want you to imagine a pot of
boiling water with a lid on it,

272
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:36,500
and then imagine that
pot becoming so hot that

273
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,420
the steam and the boiling water result
in flipping the lid off that pot.

274
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,570
Now think about that in terms of the
kind of anger we might feel inside

275
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,050
to flip one's lid means to
become angry in an uncontrolled

276
00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:54,530
way. For example,

277
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,050
my supervisor flipped his lid
when we didn't meet our sales

278
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:00,884
target.

279
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,000
Now that you have 21 English
idioms to describe feelings of joy,

280
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,680
calm, and frustration,

281
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,280
let's quickly talk about how you can
remember these and use them naturally

282
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,720
in your English conversations.

283
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,920
If you've been following me for a while
and you've watched some of my other

284
00:19:18,921 --> 00:19:21,359
lessons on learning vocabulary in English,

285
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,150
these steps will be familiar to you.

286
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,590
The first thing I want you to do is
to choose two or three new idioms

287
00:19:29,591 --> 00:19:33,150
from this list today, I recommend
choosing only two or three,

288
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,150
it's important to limit how many
idioms or expressions you try

289
00:19:38,151 --> 00:19:42,820
to learn at any given time in time
select the two or three that are most

290
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,420
interesting or helpful to you.

291
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,580
And then I want you to immediately think
about how you would use those in your

292
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,180
own example, sentences apply
those idioms to your real life.

293
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:59,650
Doing this will help you to remember
how to use them in a practical way.

294
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,730
Now, the next step is I want you
to do the same thing with the

295
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,810
same two or three idioms
for an entire week.

296
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,930
I know that seems like
a long period of time,

297
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:17,680
but the key to learning something
and remembering it is repetition.

298
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,960
And this is the biggest
mistake I see students make.

299
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,800
They learn something one time,

300
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,800
they practice it one time and then
they move on giving yourself the

301
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,240
opportunity to repeat using
the same key vocabulary.

302
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:37,710
Over a short period of time will help
you lock it into your active vocabulary.

303
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,470
So I want you to have your two or
three idioms from today's list.

304
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,070
Give yourself time to make
an example sentence today,

305
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,040
and then tomorrow do the same
thing. Create an example sentence,

306
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,160
or maybe even try to use that idiom in a
conversation that you have with someone

307
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,200
else over the next week.

308
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,560
I want you to go back to the same
two or three idioms again and again,

309
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:02,400
using them as often as you can,

310
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:08,270
this will help you to remember
them so that in two months or

311
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,230
six months or a year from now,

312
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:13,510
you're able to use that idiom accurately.

313
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,230
You haven't forgotten it as always.
If you have example sentences,

314
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,430
you can share them with me.

315
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,900
I would love for you to do that in the
comment section below while you're there.

316
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,900
Take time to review examples
from other students as well.

317
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,380
This will give you ideas of how to
use these idioms in your own life.

318
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,940
If you found today's lesson helpful
to you, I would love to know,

319
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,980
make sure that you give this lesson a
thumbs up here on YouTube and don't forget

320
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:44,010
to subscribe. So you never
miss one of these lessons.

321
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,330
Thank you so much for joining me. And
I look forward to seeing you next time.
