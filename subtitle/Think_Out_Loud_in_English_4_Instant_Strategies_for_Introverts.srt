1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,800
How many times have you worried that
your English just isn't good enough?

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,880
Because when someone asks you a
question in a business meeting,

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,500
you struggle with expressing
your ideas clearly in English,

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,370
or maybe it's hard to find the
exact words you want to use.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,410
Even after years of studying
and using English at work,

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,660
it's still a challenge to express
your ideas out loud. Recently,

7
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,070
a group of my students had a conversation
on this exact area of struggle

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,820
and in the conversation, an
interesting question came up.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,960
One student asked "when
we face obstacles at work,

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,850
or when we struggle to express
our ideas in English right away.

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,310
Is it about our English or is
it our personality?" What a

12
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,840
fascinating question.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,310
And I want to tell you exactly why this
question came up and why it's important,

14
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:59,010
but first, if you don't already know,

15
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,440
I'm Annemarie with
Speak Confident English,

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,910
everything I do here is designed to
help you get the confidence you want for

17
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:07,680
your life and work in English.

18
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,580
And now let's go back to
why that question was asked.

19
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:16,440
Why was my student curious if
the problem or the difficulty

20
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:19,560
was her English or her personality?

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,870
In that particular conversation,

22
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:26,490
my students and I were discussing
introversion as a personality trait.

23
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,080
If you are a fellow introvert like
myself and many of my students,

24
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,370
you know,

25
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,230
that you prefer to think before you speak,

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,840
you naturally like to have all
your ideas fully formed before you

27
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:46,560
share them out loud. That is
simply how your brain works.

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,420
It's how you prefer to communicate in
English and in your native language as

29
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,110
well.

30
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,490
This is very similar to how many of us
prefer to communicate in a second or

31
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,500
third language. Again,

32
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:02,100
we prefer to have time
to think before we speak,

33
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,260
there are so many different things
we need to work through. In our mind,

34
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:11,820
we're thinking about grammar,
structures, rules, pronunciation,

35
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,990
vocabulary.

36
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,300
We want time to put all those
puzzle pieces together before we

37
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:20,040
express ourselves. The challenge is,

38
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:24,360
we don't always get that
luxury. For example,

39
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,770
if you're in a job interview,

40
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,720
or if you're in a quick 10-minute
brainstorming session with your team

41
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:33,720
members to solve an
immediate problem at work,

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:39,030
you don't always get the time
that you would prefer or like to

43
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:41,970
have before you share your ideas.

44
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,300
You have to respond to
questions immediately.

45
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,220
If thinking out loud in English
is a struggle for you either

46
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:53,730
because your brain is actively
working through grammar rules,

47
00:02:53,731 --> 00:02:55,260
pronunciation vocabulary,

48
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,890
or if you also struggle
with thinking out loud,

49
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:04,840
because you naturally prefer to think
before you speak as an introvert

50
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,550
today's lesson is for you.

51
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:11,620
I want to help you feel comfortable
with that process of thinking as

52
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:13,810
you speak when you need to.

53
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,240
And this means you may also need
to share your ideas before they are

54
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:23,260
fully formed as introverts.
That's a real challenge.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,630
So today's lesson is all about
four instantly effective strategies

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,060
to help you think out loud in English.

57
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,850
[Inaudible].

58
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,130
Before we dive into the first strategy,

59
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,090
I want to talk a little bit more
about why this is so important.

60
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,320
Why do you need to learn how
to think while you speak?

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,550
Again, if you're using English
as a second or third language,

62
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,260
or if you're naturally introverted,

63
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:57,880
you prefer to have everything
clear in your mind and prepared

64
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,590
before you say them out loud.

65
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,450
This is opposite to the think out loud

66
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,070
communication style that is
preferred by extroverts. In fact,

67
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,040
just as you need a lot of alone,

68
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,570
quiet time to think carefully about
what you want to say and form those

69
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,410
ideas.

70
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,660
An extrovert actually
needs to speak out loud to

71
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,580
put those puzzle pieces together.

72
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,830
That is how they think most
clearly we could even say

73
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,470
they speak in order to think.

74
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,850
The reason this is a challenge
is in many workplaces,

75
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:39,220
particularly in the United States,

76
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,820
an extroverted communication
style is preferred,

77
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,790
and it may even be expected.

78
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,350
It may be expected that you're
able to communicate your ideas

79
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:54,220
quickly. Even if you're not
ready. Several weeks ago,

80
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:58,510
I did a lesson on the topic of
how to brainstorm in English,

81
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,600
particularly if you're a
naturally shy and introverted.

82
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,790
One of the recommendations I made
in that lesson was to learn how to

83
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,540
think out loud, how to
express your thoughts,

84
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,580
even when they're not fully formed.

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,360
This lesson today is the
continuation of that.

86
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,400
And we're going to focus a hundred
percent on how you can begin

87
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,390
to practice thinking out loud
so that when you need to,

88
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,310
you're able to do it successfully.

89
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,240
Strategy number one is when
you're in a conversation

90
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:35,380
and you're asked to speak in the moment
with little time to put your thoughts

91
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:36,214
together,

92
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,900
verify relevance and ensure
that you're on the right track.

93
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's unpack that a little bit.

94
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,990
Sometimes when you're trying to put
your thoughts and ideas together,

95
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:51,610
it's like looking for different pieces
of a puzzle and putting them in different

96
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:56,170
places to see if they fit. There's
a lot of internal thinking going on.

97
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,470
So while your team members
may be having a conversation,

98
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:04,280
you might start to get
lost in the conversation.

99
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,100
You're not focused on what they're saying.

100
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,770
You're more focused on what
you're thinking internally.

101
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,960
This might be because you're processing
everything in English. Again,

102
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:17,990
trying to find the right grammar
structure and vocabulary.

103
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,000
It might also be because it's your
natural preferred communication

104
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:24,770
style as an introvert.

105
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,080
So if someone suddenly asks you a question
and you're expected to respond in the

106
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:34,100
moment, it might come as a surprise or
a shock to you, and you might think,

107
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,620
I don't really know what
everybody was saying.

108
00:06:36,621 --> 00:06:40,820
I'm not prepared to say what
I want to say in that moment.

109
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,980
You can do a couple of things to ensure
that you're on the right track and

110
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,000
buy yourself a little bit more
time to get your thoughts together.

111
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,350
First,

112
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,270
you can ensure that your ideas or
what you might say are relevant.

113
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,160
This is a great way to double
check whether something
has already been mentioned

114
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:04,760
or discussed. For
example, just to clarify,

115
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,580
have we discussed to clarify,

116
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:12,500
have we already reviewed the data from
last August when we experienced a similar

117
00:07:12,501 --> 00:07:15,560
downturn in the market?
When I asked that question,

118
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:20,570
I'm making sure that my
thoughts are relevant to the

119
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,860
current conversation.

120
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,360
I'm also giving myself a little
bit more time to think. Now,

121
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,410
if you're afraid that you've totally
missed part of the conversation and you

122
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:35,210
want to get filled in on the details
and buy yourself a little bit of a

123
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:39,680
time, here are a few more questions you
can ask to make sure that your thoughts,

124
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,510
your ideas are on track for the
conversation. Sorry, before I answer that,

125
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:49,220
I'd like to circle back to the
details you shared on data from last

126
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:52,190
August or before I answer that,

127
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:56,930
could we briefly recap the details or
the main points of the discussion so far

128
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,750
once more and asking these questions,

129
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,590
you're ensuring that whatever
thoughts you had internally,

130
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:08,390
whatever ideas you're considering
to share are appropriate

131
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,890
or relevant to the current conversation.
And now strategy number two,

132
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,880
this strategy is particularly
helpful. If like me,

133
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:21,500
you're a fellow introvert and
prefer to have your ideas fully

134
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,450
formed before you share them.

135
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,740
You like to have the whole puzzle put
together or the whole picture ready.

136
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,560
But again, we don't
always get that luxury.

137
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,050
So to help you feel more comfortable,

138
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,820
you can preface what you're going
to say to let others know that your

139
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:40,280
idea is not fully formed.

140
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,990
It can reduce some of that anxiety
that we feel when we have to

141
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:48,380
communicate ideas that we
don't feel ready to share.

142
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,540
This is also helpful when you're in a
conversation where everyone is expected to

143
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,500
bounce ideas off one another.

144
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,330
And I also like to remind my introverted
students that when you share an

145
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,770
idea in a brainstorming session,
you're not married to it.

146
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,900
You don't have to fully commit to it.
It's okay to change your mind later,

147
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,970
especially when you're in a brainstorming
conversation where everyone is sharing

148
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,390
initial ideas that aren't fully formed.

149
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,430
So here's how you could preface some of
your statements. This is just a thought,

150
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:26,880
but what if we, I'm just
thinking out loud here,

151
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:30,480
but I'm still thinking
this through. However,

152
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:33,720
let me give you a full example
of what that might sound like.

153
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,420
I'm still thinking this through, however,

154
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:41,550
would it be possible to have everyone
on a rotating schedule so that all of

155
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:46,410
us are back in the office,
but on different days by
starting with the preface,

156
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm still thinking this through,
or I'm just thinking out loud.

157
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm letting others know that
my idea is not fully ready

158
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,950
and it helps take the
pressure off me as well.

159
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,740
Here are three more ways
that you can do that.

160
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,900
I haven't figured out the logistics,

161
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:07,710
but I'm just brainstorming here, but,

162
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,650
and I'm still putting the pieces together,

163
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,420
but here's another example. I'm
still putting the pieces together,

164
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:18,810
but one option may be
to reschedule the event.

165
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,550
I know it may require more work upfront
because we've already reserved the venue

166
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:25,140
and sent out invitations,

167
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,850
but rescheduling might allow us
to have much better attendance.

168
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,990
Those particular sentence starters
are some of my favorites to use,

169
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:38,640
especially when I'm feeling anxious
or feeling pressure to share something

170
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:43,290
that I just don't think is ready.
And now let's move on to strategy.

171
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:47,910
Number three of how you can get
more comfortable with sharing your

172
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:52,410
ideas out loud, invite others
to share their mindscapes.

173
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,520
I love that word mindscape
and it might be new to you.

174
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,170
A mindscape is a mental
scene or an area of the

175
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:05,340
imagination. When you invite
someone into your mindscape,

176
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,360
you're inviting them into your
imagination. And of course,

177
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:13,350
in our imagination, we're just
thinking of all the possibilities.

178
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,410
The possibilities are limitless,

179
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,090
inviting others into that conversation
can be a really fun discussion.

180
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,880
And again, there's no pressure.

181
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,890
There's not an expectation
that the ideas are fully formed

182
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:30,660
and ready as a result,

183
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:35,490
it can reduce your anxiety and
create more mental space for

184
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:40,350
ideas that are in the works.
If an idea is in the works,

185
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,150
it means it's still in process. You're
still thinking it through or forming it.

186
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,100
So if you'd like to take a discussion
into another direction and invite

187
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,310
others into your mindscape, here
are a different ways to do that.

188
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,670
For this sake of exploring
a different perspective.

189
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,880
How about those are great ideas,

190
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,430
but what are your thoughts on exploring?

191
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,380
Let's explore some alternatives
together. What if we, and finally,

192
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,160
I'm pondering whether this will
work, but what's your opinion on,

193
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,900
did you notice that in many of those
examples, I use the word explore,

194
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,300
which is perfect. When we want to look
at alternatives, other perspectives,

195
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,560
and really get into
imaginative thinking again,

196
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,270
where our ideas are not fully
formed. Let me give you an example,

197
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:34,420
sentence of how I might
use one of those phrases.

198
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,160
Those are great ideas, but what
are your thoughts on exploring,

199
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:41,890
switching to a totally new platform?

200
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,200
When I say that I'm simply
introducing one of my own ideas

201
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,650
and my idea might not be
fully formed. In fact,

202
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:55,420
maybe I don't even want my company or
our team to switch to a new platform,

203
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,280
but I'm just introducing it
to the conversation so that
we can consider it as an

204
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:01,114
option.

205
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,890
And now our final strategy for today
on how to confidently think out loud in

206
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:08,050
English, whether you're struggling,

207
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,710
because you're trying to put all
those English pieces together,

208
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,530
or it's a challenge because
you're naturally introverted.

209
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,600
Our strategy is piggyback
with confidence in a

210
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,130
brainstorming conversation.

211
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:25,840
You'll often hear others
piggyback on each other's ideas to

212
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:30,730
piggyback on someone else's
idea means to use their existing

213
00:13:30,731 --> 00:13:35,230
idea as the basis or
foundation for your own in

214
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,430
brainstorming. This is fantastic.
When you hear someone else's idea,

215
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,290
you want to say that you agree with
it and you want to add to it in

216
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:49,030
doing so that also alleviates some
of the pressure you might feel

217
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,310
of needing to share a completely
formed idea instead of sharing

218
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:54,940
your own.

219
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:59,710
You're simply adding to someone else's
here are four great ways that you can do

220
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:03,940
that. I'd like to explore
Susan's idea further.

221
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,360
What if we, Susan made a great point.

222
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,710
I wonder if I agree with
Susan and how about,

223
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,940
and finally I like
Susan's idea and we could,

224
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,110
let me give you an example of what it
would sound like using one of these in a

225
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:20,950
sentence.

226
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,110
I like Susan's idea of each team
member focusing on their own project

227
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,830
rather than splitting up
tasks within a project.

228
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,240
And we could look into using a project
management tool to make sure that

229
00:14:34,241 --> 00:14:38,620
everyone's on track with
that you have four instantly

230
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:43,600
effective strategies to help you think
out loud in English with confidence so

231
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:48,220
that you don't have to worry
about sharing unfinished ideas.

232
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,850
Let me do a quick recap of the
four strategies. Number one,

233
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,170
verify relevance and ensure
you're on track. Number two,

234
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,580
preface your ideas when you don't
feel that they're ready. Number three,

235
00:15:01,581 --> 00:15:05,270
invite others into your
mindscape and number four,

236
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:09,500
piggyback on other's ideas
with confidence to finish up.

237
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,630
I have one simple question for you.

238
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,420
If you struggle with sharing your
ideas out loud or thinking out

239
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:20,330
loud, particularly when you
don't feel that they're ready,

240
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,320
either because you're struggling with
putting all the pieces together in your

241
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,650
English skills or because
you're naturally introverted.

242
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,810
I would love to know which of these
strategies you're most excited

243
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:36,410
about. Which one did
you hear and think, yes,

244
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:40,490
I'm going to try to use that in my
next business meeting or my next

245
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,020
brainstorming conversation.

246
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,830
I would love to know which
one really fit with you.

247
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,000
And I'd like you to try
using one of the example,

248
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:54,410
phrases that you learned today. You
can use it in a real life example.

249
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,250
Think about a conversation you've had
recently where you had to share one of

250
00:15:58,251 --> 00:15:59,150
your ideas.

251
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,160
How could you have used one of
these phrases to help you do that?

252
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,210
You can share your example
with me in the comments below.

253
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,530
