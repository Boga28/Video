00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,000
hey everyone i'm alex thanks for clicking and 
welcome to this lesson on 30 common imperatives  

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,960
that you can use in your daily life so for this 
video i wanted to focus on the short phrases we  

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:25,040
hear everywhere so these are phrases you will 
hear at the bank at the grocery store in your  

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:34,240
own home in movies on television anywhere you 
can think of we use these short brief imperatives  

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:42,480
now before i begin i want to mention this is 
different than the 30 phrasal verb commands  

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,960
video that i made in the past if you enjoy this 
video and you want to hear some other imperatives  

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,640
some other commands that you can use in english 
but which are a little more challenging because  

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:02,800
they have an idiomatic element to it check out the 
link attached to this video for 30 phrasal verb  

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,000
commands this is 30 imperatives for daily life 
there will be very little idiomatic language in  

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:18,880
this it's very clear what each word means okay so 
let's start let's do it let's go ah those are two  

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:27,280
of the first imperatives so let's do it why not 
let's go so you know what this means if you're  

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:35,760
leaving on a trip someone will say come on let's 
go or let's do it do you guys want to go for lunch  

13
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:44,640
yeah let's do it so let's is like let us it's 
inviting everyone right it's making a suggestion  

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:53,840
to let's do it let's go let's leave um 
let's make this happen next come here  

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,960
now this obviously you can use in a lot of 
different contexts specifically with children  

16
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,280
or with people in your daily life other 
adults other teenagers other 20 somethings  

17
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,680
so you can say hey come here right you're 
there i want you to come this way so come here  

18
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,760
next if you're at a restaurant the person 
who you meet at this at the entrance to the  

19
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:31,120
restaurant or the server might say follow me it 
means like come with me now they might also say  

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,280
come this way please or come right this way 
you can you don't have to say come in this  

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,080
situation necessarily you could say come this 
way or come right this way but you can also say  

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,640
or you might also hear this way 
please the implication is follow me  

23
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,760
or write this way which means come this way 
come follow me all right so next time you're  

24
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,000
at a restaurant and you hear right this way you 
won't feel confused right or you hear this way  

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,240
please or follow me you will know what it means 
it means come in this direction with me next  

26
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,480
keep doing what you're doing okay so if someone is 
working on something and they're doing a good job  

27
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:32,160
on it you want to encourage them or you want them 
to continue in the same manner in the same way  

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,640
you can say yeah just keep doing what you're 
doing okay next keep going this means again  

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,280
continue just continue moving forward keep going 
so this could be you know you're telling a person  

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
if who is driving and you're in the passenger 
seat and they say do i turn left do i turn right  

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,960
and you say no no keep going keep going 
okay like continue driving straight okay  

32
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:10,240
next wait okay so wait this just means stop where 
you are and you can say wait here uh wait there  

33
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,800
you might hear this in a doctor's office or 
a dentist's office probably with a please  

34
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,480
at the end of it or at the beginning of 
it so please wait here wait here please  

35
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:32,800
uh please wait over there okay or please wait 
you know in that room next hold it okay so hold  

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,320
it has i put an asterisk because it has a couple 
of different contexts one hold it can mean whoa  

37
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:50,480
stop wait hold it i don't understand what's 
going on or i'm confused or ah what you said  

38
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:57,440
is really like shocking to me or interesting 
and you say whoa whoa hold it wait stop okay  

39
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,800
now hold it can also mean literally like here hold 
this hold that means like if you have a phone and  

40
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,520
you say oh hold on a sec i need to do something 
and you can say can you hold this for a second  

41
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,880
hold this hold it or hold the elevator this means 
like you know the person is coming and they might  

42
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:29,840
say hold the elevator and say okay i'm going to 
hold the elevator for the person next stay still

43
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,040
stand still

44
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:44,480
don't move stay right there these are 
all different ways to say don't move  

45
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,840
okay so like stay still maybe you're in a 
situation where you're on safari and you're  

46
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,160
trying to see an animal or you're in a forest and 
you see a bird and you don't want the bird to fly  

47
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,480
away so you tell your friend who's with you 
you're you have a camera you say stand still  

48
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:12,160
stay still don't move you will scare the bird away 
i want to get a good picture or stay right there  

49
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:21,760
okay so you're telling people commanding people to 
just stop moving in this situation next try again  

50
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,840
why don't you try again okay or try one 
more time so maybe you're sending an email  

51
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,320
and for some reason the email bounces back or the 
email doesn't you know doesn't get sent properly  

52
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,400
you might tell your friend something is wrong with 
the wi-fi just try again maybe it will work now  

53
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:50,560
try one more time you can also say stop 
right there so this is similar to again  

54
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,640
don't move but if someone's coming your way 
you say whoa whoa whoa stop right there okay  

55
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:06,560
next uh how about try it right so you can you 
can tell someone who you know there's a new  

56
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,680
food or something and you just want to want 
to tell them to sample it you can say try it  

57
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,360
why not right it might be good you might like it 
you can also use try it to talk about activities  

58
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:26,560
try it help me help is a very useful imperative 
right so if you're carrying something heavy  

59
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,320
can you help me or help me please all right 
or help him help her if you're a teacher  

60
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,880
you could say to one student oh you're 
done uh vanessa help him please or  

61
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,120
help katie please right so you hear this all 
the time help that person help her help me  

62
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:56,640
give it to me give it to her give it to him so 
this means pass what you have to someone else  

63
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,280
so maybe i need a pencil and you say okay you have 
a pencil okay give it to me give it to me right  

64
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,360
it's my turn or it's i'm next i need what you 
have give it to me please or please give it to me  

65
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:19,840
okay next click tap or scroll so this is on your 
phone um on your laptop on your desktop computer  

66
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,720
uh depending on if it's touch or not right you 
can say click here oh click there uh tap here  

67
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,360
uh scroll there okay so uh scroll you can also use 
you know scroll left scroll right scroll up scroll  

68
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:44,400
down um another one is swipe right so swipe is i 
don't have it written here but it's a bonus s w  

69
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:53,840
i p e swipe right swipe right swipe 
left etc so in the middle we have  

70
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:05,120
be quiet right so you want people to turn 
down the volume in the room be quiet stop that  

71
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,240
stop it right uh so this is some something 
that i say to my children very frequently  

72
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,040
um if they are misbehaving or if they are fighting 
or arguing with each other like girls stop that  

73
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,840
stop it okay so a very common uh imperative 
that you might hear and in addition to stop that  

74
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:35,680
and say uh don't do that okay or don't do it so 
here you're trying to discourage people from doing  

75
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,840
something don't do that right stop walking up the 
stairs you're well they probably don't understand  

76
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,720
you maybe if they're a year and a half old 
they're a baby all right don't do that stop that  

77
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,400
okay very common be careful it's like 
you're walking somewhere and maybe the road  

78
00:09:54,400 --> 00:10:00,480
is not very steady is not very stable and you 
know this road and you know this sidewalk that  

79
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,400
you're walking with your friend you 
tell your friend hey be careful here  

80
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,920
okay so be careful means pay attention which is 
next right pay attention focus your attention look  

81
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:21,040
around identify any danger around you right so 
pay attention don't lose your focus next we have

82
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:32,800
ask him ask her ask them ask your teacher right 
so why don't you ask that person if you are in a  

83
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,480
theme park right or you're in a grocery store 
and you don't know where something is you say  

84
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,720
hey where is that big monster ride or whatever 
roller coaster that i'm looking for and you see  

85
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,680
someone who works in the park and say excuse 
me where is that your friend will tell you oh  

86
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,400
ask him he knows he knows where that is or maybe 
she knows where that is right so ask very useful  

87
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:05,680
next let go let go of that let go of it let go 
means to release something so something is like  

88
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,800
you know clenched in your hand or you're holding 
something and the person someone else will say  

89
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,840
let go let go of it let go of that right so you're 
holding something and your friend wants it someone  

90
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:28,560
in your family wants it and they say come on 
let go let go of that let go of it leave it okay  

91
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:36,960
so this means don't touch it um you can say leave 
it here leave it there leave it on the table all  

92
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,960
right so you can have a bottle say uh just leave 
it there or if a friend comes to your house  

93
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,960
and they're carrying a big bag and they say oh 
where can i put this and you say uh just leave  

94
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:56,160
it there put it in the corner right so leave it 
in the corner and speaking of put it's right here  

95
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:04,000
put right so put is the act of like transporting 
the object into the place leave just means like  

96
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:13,200
let it rest in that area okay so leave it put it 
here put it there etc now the little difference  

97
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:19,120
the grammatical difference between leave it and 
put it leave it can stand on its own you can  

98
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:27,600
say just leave it don't touch it you can also say 
leave it here leave it there etc put it you can't  

99
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:36,160
just say put it you have to tell the person where 
to put it right so put it here put it there put it  

100
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:47,040
on the top shelf wherever it may be so those were
