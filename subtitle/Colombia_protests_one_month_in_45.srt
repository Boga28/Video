00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,880
Colombia is marking one month since a wave 
of deadly protests began. They started as an  

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,520
outcry against a controversial tax reform but soon 
turned into a national uprising against growing  

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,080
poverty and inequality. Weeks of negotiations 
to end the unrest have failed to bear fruit.  

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,000
And the prospect of a peaceful solution seemed to 
slip even further on Friday, when President Ivan  

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,600
Duque announced he was deploying the military 
after more people died in demonstrations. 

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,080
Plumes of smoke tower above the city of 
Popayan - like monuments to the resistance. 

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,720
A month of protests has turned streets across the  

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,800
country into smoldering battle-scars from 
what they see as their fight for justice. 

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,360
"The message we want to deliver is that we are 
tired of so much injustice from this corrupt  

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,880
government, of so much inequality. 
We are not asking for any handouts.  

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,560
We are not asking them to give us anything. 
We're only asking for an opportunity to grow,  

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,680
for equality - not only for the 
rich, but also for the poor." 

13
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,840
The protests erupted when President Ivan Duque 
sought to raise taxes to pay for the pandemic.  

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,520
The blowback forced him to kill the bill. 
But the outcry continued - in outrage over  

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:40,000
the government's handling of a crisis that's 
seen unemployment double and inequality surge. 

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,440
Attempts to broker an end to the 
standoff have so far proven futile. 

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,120
According to official figures, more than 45 people 
have been killed, dozens more disappeared and  

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:57,440
thousands on both sides wounded. But human rights 
groups say the real toll is likely much higher. 

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
And it's only likely to get 
worse in the days ahead. 

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,400
On Friday, President Duque said he's 
deploying the army to epicenter of the unrest: 

21
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,280
Cali, where at least three people 
were killed in the last 24 hours. 

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,840
"Let me be absolutely clear: As of tonight, 
we begin the maximum deployment of military  

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
assistance in the city of Cali 
and (the department of) El Valle.  

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
Islands of anarchy do not 
have a place in our country." 

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,680
Meeting with Colombia's Vice President on Friday, 
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his  

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,520
concern over the deepening crisis in the country - 
backing the peoples' right to protest peacefully. 

27
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:03,840
For now, though, the deadly cat-and-mouse 
game on the streets of Colombia continues.
