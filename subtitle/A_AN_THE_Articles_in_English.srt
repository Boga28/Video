00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Articles

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,760
Learning article in short

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:03,880
Hello

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,840
And welcome to the next video

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,020
Today I'm going to teach you about

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,400
a very difficult

7
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,820
confusing

8
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,440
fun

9
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,280
maybe

10
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,500
grammar point

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,200
called articles

12
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:18,700
*wink*

13
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,840
Oh, really ? Yeah

14
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,400
Articles are confusing

15
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,300
there are many many rules

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,320
in english about articles

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,280
I do not have the time

18
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,500
the energy

19
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,180
to teach you all of them

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,400
but I'll do my best

21
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,160
Okay?

22
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:36,960
And

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,800
What are articles first of all ?

24
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,140
Articles are

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,500
A

26
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,820
AN

27
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,580
and THE

28
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,460
Articles come before a noun

29
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,160
A noun is : a person

30
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,860
a place

31
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,000
or a thing

32
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:57,980
So

33
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,960
I'm going to generalise here

34
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,880
and say that

35
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,460
before most nouns in english

36
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,600
you have to use an article

37
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,920
Of course there are millions of exceptions

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,480
to what I've just said

39
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,200
Sometimes we do not use an article with a noun

40
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,160
That's a whole other lesson

41
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,580
Hold the time warp for your brain

42
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,420
we're gonna stick to these ones

43
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,840
When to use A

44
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,540
AN

45
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,340
and THE

46
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,780
before a noun in a proper english sentence

47
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,500
We use these

48
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,620
when we speak

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,800
when we write

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,040
and they're very important in grammar

51
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,120
So

52
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,680
There's no way to avoid these

53
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,780
I'll help you don't worry

54
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,000
The first one is AN

55
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,680
AN's easy

56
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,240
It's the easiest we'll do this one first

57
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,220
AN

58
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,360
is a singular noun

59
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,940
huh

60
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,640
is used in the singular nouns

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,160
it's in article

62
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,240
and

63
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,860
we use it before

64
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,060
the noun that starts with a vowel

65
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,580
now

66
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,360
the pronunciation of this word

67
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,180
sounds like

68
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,220
va-will

69
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,780
the vowels in english we have five vowels in english

70
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,480
they are

71
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,260
A

72
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,520
E

73
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,540
I

74
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,260
O

75
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,540
and U

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,500
now

77
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,900
Everyone who speaks spanish

78
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,840
portuguese

79
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,680
italian

80
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,400
any of our latin american friends

81
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,740
or latin language speakers

82
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,020
you're gonna mix up these two vowels E and I

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,760
Let me teach you one thing that will help you

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
If you can remember

85
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,440
that you have to dot your I

86
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,980
you're gonna get the pronunciation of this word

87
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,340
so this word

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,940
or this letter sorry

89
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,340
When you write this letter

90
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,540
You always have to put a *ping* a dot

91
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,440
in the middle of the word

92
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,120
so you're going to remember that

93
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,180
this I

94
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
you can make a nice little EYE here

95
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,060
to help you

96
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,560
So, I

97
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,300
When you write this word

98
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,780
by itself you have to use a capital

99
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,020
so this would only be in the middle of a word

100
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,160
but the pronunciation is the same

101
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,180
I

102
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,400
So

103
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,800
If you have a vowel

104
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,340
A, E, I, O, U

105
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,300
that begins

106
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
the noun

107
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,380
you have to use AN

108
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,460
for example

109
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,160
"eye"

110
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,280
yey

111
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,560
We have to say

112
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,020
"an eye"

113
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,080
because the word eye begins with a vowel

114
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,900
If the word begins with

115
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,120
this word

116
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,480
with this letter I

117
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,580
for example "ice cream" yey

118
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,540
We have to say "I'd like AN ice cream"

119
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,380
Do you like ice cream ?

120
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,400
Or

121
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,940
If the word begins with a vowel sound

122
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:08,020
How can, what is a vowel sound Ronnie ?

123
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,340
A vowel sound is usually always

124
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,380
the letter H

125
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,420
for example

126
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,500
the word

127
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:15,940
"hour"

128
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,320
We do not even say the H word

129
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,100
it sounds like we're saying "our"

130
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,300
So

131
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,720
Because this word "hour"

132
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,420
sounds like a vowel because the H

133
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,260
is silent

134
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,460
We have to say

135
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,560
"an hour"

136
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,320
Ok, you got it? You with me?

137
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,320
"an hour" so

138
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,360
AN

139
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,660
We use before

140
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,960
a vowel

141
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,220
or

142
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,640
before a vowel sound

143
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,740
usually

144
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,740
a noun that begins with an H

145
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,320
The next one is A

146
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,420
The very first letter of our alphabet

147
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,380
A

148
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,080
is a vowel

149
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,320
Don't let that confuse you

150
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,560
A

151
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:08,760
We use

152
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,920
for again a singular noun

153
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,820
All of these are going to be used with singular nouns

154
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,640
If the noun is plural

155
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,680
if the noun has an S

156
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,000
Do not use an article

157
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,580
So

158
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,800
A

159
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,300
We use for a singular noun

160
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,100
in a general form

161
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,120
You can think of this

162
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,200
easier as

163
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,960
using, replacing it with the word "any"

164
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,000
So

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,720
If you go

166
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,520
to

167
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,120
a coffee shop

168
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,860
and they have

169
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,700
five muffins

170
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,540
and they're all the same muffin

171
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,080
You're going to say to the person that works at the coffee shop

172
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,200
"Hello"

173
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,220
"I'd like A muffin"

174
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,840
You do not get to choose

175
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
or pick

176
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,520
what muffin you get

177
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,700
You can choose the flavor

178
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,000
but you cannot specifically choose

179
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,220
which muffin you would like

180
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,480
It's the same

181
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,160
as saying "any"

182
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,680
It's like saying

183
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,080
"I'd like any muffin"

184
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,100
"Just get me a muffin"

185
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,240
"I want a muffin"

186
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,340
"I'd like anything"

187
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,440
"Just give me something"

188
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,260
Okay ?

189
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,080
It's used for when you don't care which one it is

190
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,740
You just want one of something

191
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,320
A

192
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,320
If my nose was stuffy and I had to blow my nose

193
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,180
I would ask someone

194
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,280
"Do you have A Kleenex ?"

195
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,120
I don't

196
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,860
have to go through the box

197
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,820
of Kleenexes

198
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,860
"No, I don't want that one"

199
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,740
"No, yes, this, no"

200
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,620
You're just gonna get A Kleenex and you're gonna blow your nose

201
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,400
Okay ?

202
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,520
So

203
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,420
A and AN

204
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,240
the only difference is

205
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,440
AN you use before a vowel

206
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,860
as an example

207
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,980
You can say

208
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,280
"I'd like

209
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,100
a

210
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,700
cookie"

211
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
I was going to write coffee maybe I want a coffee right now

212
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,980
but I would definitely rather have

213
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,160
a cookie

214
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,060
I don't care which cookie you give me

215
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,900
Just give me a cookie

216
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,260
I'm the cookie monster

217
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,760
Okay ?

218
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,340
So

219
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,440
"I'd like a cookie"

220
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,260
I'd like any cookie

221
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,460
The next

222
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:29,880
is

223
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,520
THE

224
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,280
THE next is THE

225
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,520
THE

226
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,620
is opposite to A

227
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,520
THE

228
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,900
means something very very very specific

229
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,520
general and specific are opposite

230
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,100
this means

231
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,940
you actually choose

232
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,020
which one

233
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,740
you are going to get

234
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,740
Think about this when you go shopping

235
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,060
You do not walk into a store and go

236
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,700
"Hi, could I have a shirt ?"

237
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,820
"I don't care what it looks like I don't care how much it is

238
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,700
"Just gimme a shirt"

239
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,000
This never happens

240
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:07,980
Ladies

241
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,340
When you go shopping for shoes

242
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,200
You just don't go into the shoe store and say

243
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,760
"Just a pair of shoes please"

244
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,560
"Just a pair of shoes"

245
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,200
"Don't care"

246
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,960
"Size 8, fine, anything"

247
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,720
No

248
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,960
We want to go though all of the shoes

249
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,700
We want to try them all on

250
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,080
We want to get a handbag and match them

251
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,980
with our shoes

252
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,400
and choose

253
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,920
the shoes of our dreams

254
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,459
So you're not going to say "A pair of shoes"

255
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,840
You're gonna say "THE"

256
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,640
shoes

257
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
Another very confusing thing

258
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,800
about THE

259
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:46,980
is

260
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,620
the second time

261
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:50,820
you talk

262
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,980
about the same noun

263
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,980
in a phrase

264
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,620
you have to put

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,600
the second noun with THE

266
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,220
for example

267
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,860
This is a little more difficult

268
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,000
"I bought

269
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,280
some fruit"

270
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,140
Okay ?

271
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,080
"Fruit"

272
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,440
is an uncountable noun

273
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,060
If the noun is uncountable

274
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,100
we do not use an article

275
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,900
"I bought some fruit"

276
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,600
"THE fruit

277
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:21,920
was bad"

278
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,980
But Ronnie you just said

279
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,980
if it's an uncountable noun

280
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,080
we don't use an article

281
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,280
What are you doing ?

282
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,840
Have you lost your mind ?

283
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,040
No

284
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,860
This is a grammar rule

285
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,440
The first time I talk about the fruit

286
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,580
I use no article

287
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,240
because it's uncountable

288
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,740
but

289
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,300
the second time I'm talking about the same noun

290
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,000
I have to

291
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,600
I don't know why I just have to it's a rule

292
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,020
So I have to say "THE fruit"

293
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,340
"THE fruit was bad"

294
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,520
The third point

295
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,780
when we use the article THE

296
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,720
the article THE

297
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,180
I'm using articles all the time

298
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,680
is

299
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,340
when the speaker

300
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,780
and the listener

301
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,060
or the reader

302
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,040
whatever, if you're reading or listening

303
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,340
know

304
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,840
they both know

305
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,140
which

306
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,540
noun you are talking about

307
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,520
for example

308
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,240
If you and your friends

309
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,100
go to the same school

310
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,280
you have to say "THE school"

311
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,940
If I were talking to my friend on the phone and I said

312
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,400
"Hey, yeah, hum

313
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, I left my book at the school"

314
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,100
My friend and I both know

315
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,660
what school I am talking about

316
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,880
In my city there are 2,5 million schools

317
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,220
There's a lot of schools in Toronto

318
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,940
There are 2,5 million people

319
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,440
and a lot of people go to different schools

320
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,780
but because my friend and I go to the same school

321
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,380
I have to say "THE school"

322
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,620
"I'm going to go

323
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,860
to THE school tomorrow"

324
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,460
You and I both know we're talking about the same one

325
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,320
Okay ?

326
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,100
The next one is

327
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
we use with countries

328
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,300
but only 1% of the countries of the world

329
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,620
So I ask you

330
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,720
What country are you from ?

331
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,880
I am from Canada

332
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,020
We have listeners from all over the world

333
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
I would guarantee that 99% of you

334
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,620
would not use an article with your country name

335
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,640
I come from Canada

336
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,980
Below Canada there's a country

337
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,420
it's a big country called

338
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,080
anyone know?

339
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,180
Below Canada ? Geography time

340
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,220
The United States of America

341
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,000
or, shorter

342
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,220
the USA

343
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,600
A lot of people, their ancestors

344
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,360
in Canada came from a country

345
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,080
a group of countries called the United Kingdom

346
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,960
THE United Kingdom

347
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:12,880
hum

348
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,620
There's a country in the middle east called

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,280
the United Arab Emirates

350
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,520
If anyone from there ?

351
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,140
I went there once in an airplane

352
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,980
It's cool

353
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,000
The United States

354
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,000
The United Kingdom

355
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,540
The United Arab Emirates

356
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,720
All of these three countries

357
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,420
we have to use THE

358
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:34,880
because

359
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,440
there is the word "united" in the title

360
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:40,980
of the country

361
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,140
I do not say "the" Canada

362
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,560
I do not say "the" Japan

363
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,380
If the word has "united" in it I say "the"

364
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,860
The second one is

365
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,240
if the country has more than two words

366
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,320
in the name

367
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,740
you're gonna say "the"

368
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
for example "New Zealand"

369
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,600
New Zealand only has two words

370
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,940
I do not say 'the' New Zealand

371
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,920
If it has more than two words

372
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,160
I have to put "the"

373
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,500
in front of the country

374
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,620
The last one is the most difficult

375
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,780
If you are like me and did not do well in geography class

376
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,540
this one's hard

377
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,760
we have to use THE

378
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,940
if the country is comprised of

379
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,820
tiny or small islands

380
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:27,600
I do not expect everyone in the world to know

381
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,960
which countries are made of small islands

382
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,440
but to help you out

383
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,440
off the top of my head

384
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,760
the Philippines

385
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,180
if you look at a map

386
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,060
The Philippines has many tiny little islands

387
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,800
that make one country

388
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,040
another example would be The West Indies

389
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,740
The Canary Islands

390
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,440
these are all places

391
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,780
that have small islands that

392
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,220
form one country

393
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,420
So

394
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,660
If you look at Japan for example

395
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,800
Japan has

396
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,060
maybe five or more islands

397
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,180
but there are quite large

398
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,080
so we cannot use this as "the Japan"

399
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,020
They have to be very small islands

400
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,640
I hope you understand this

401
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,960
If you have a question please leave me a comment

402
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
if you need more help with this

403
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,240
please ask me

404
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,260
bye
