00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,639
hey guys welcome to lingua marina let's

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,840
talk about

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,000
english students least favorite tense

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,520
which is present perfect

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,400
because it is so confusing i was taught

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,639
at school that present perfect is a past

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,280
tense which is not because if we look at

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,720
its name it says

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
present perfect which means that yes

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,160
we're talking about our actions in the

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,039
past

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,640
but their result is still here with us

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,359
in the present this is why it's present

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,000
perfect it's

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,679
a present tense and it's really

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,680
important not to mix it up with the past

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,160
tense

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,160
it's really important to use it in the

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,000
right way so today we're gonna talk

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,399
about

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,160
present perfect one of the most

22
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,440
important things to remember about

23
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,680
present perfect is that we don't really

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,480
care

25
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,520
when exactly something happened

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
for example i say i've lost my keys i

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,760
don't really care if i lost them

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,680
yesterday i don't really care if i lost

29
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,640
them a week ago

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,800
i care about the result i've lost my

31
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,480
keys and i can't

32
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,440
get into my house this is the result and

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,400
so it doesn't matter when exactly

34
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,560
the action happened it matters that the

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
result is still here

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
it's my present i can't get into my

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,960
house

38
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,960
the way we form this tense is that we

39
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,080
use either have

40
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,360
or has i have you have

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,799
they have we have it she

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,159
he has after that we use

43
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,439
our verb in the third form

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
and here please pay attention we have

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,280
regular verbs

46
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,040
where the third form is the same as

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,520
second and is easily formed

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
by adding ed play played played stop

49
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,520
stop

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
stopped and we have irregular verbs that

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,159
you have to learn

52
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,200
run run run

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
bring broad broad rise rose risen

54
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,079
so we use the third form and please

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
remember that some regular verbs

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,640
actually change the way they're written

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,000
so for example

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
say sad sad we get rid of y in the

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,399
second and third form

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,439
and we add i d study

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,479
studied studied so just pay attention to

62
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,120
the spelling of those words so we have

63
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,640
has or have

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,760
we have a verb in the third form and if

65
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,599
it's a regular verb we add ed

66
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,000
if it's irregular verb we just learn the

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,959
third form

68
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,080
and very often we have

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,400
a word that tells us that we have to use

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,319
present perfect ever never since already

71
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,120
yet

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,599
remember what i told you we don't really

73
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,560
care

74
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,040
about the exact timing of an action so

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
whenever you have

76
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,680
a year ago in 1990

77
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
in march 2015 that means that you would

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,879
probably need to use past simple because

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,640
again in present perfect

80
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,760
we don't care about the exact

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,239
point at time we don't care about the

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,000
exact day or exact year

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,920
we just care about the result so i have

84
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,360
never eaten pizza in my life

85
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,920
okay the result if i try pizza it's

86
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
gonna be something new for me

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,599
i've never eaten a taco i've been to

88
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,120
great britain once

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,720
that means if i go now it wouldn't be a

90
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,159
new country for me

91
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,840
but it doesn't really matter whether

92
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
i've been in great britain in

93
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,040
2015 or 2020 in this case would use past

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,159
simple sim i've been to italy many times

95
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,560
also when you are taking your toefl test

96
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,159

97
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,720

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,120

103

this is formal academic english

104
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,599
and this is what's required from you

105
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,519

contractions

123
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,240
when you are taking an academic test the

124
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280
negative form

125
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,320
in this tense is formed by adding not i

126
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,720
have

127
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,280
not done this i have not seen this

128
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,639
before

129
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
or if you want to make it shorter you

130
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
can say i haven't done this before i

131
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,479
haven't seen this before

132
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,400
when you're forming a question in

133
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,240
present perfect this half

134
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
goes into the beginning of the sentence

135
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
have you ever been to the united states

136
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,720
if you want to add wh question your wh

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,000
word comes first

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,400
who what when whatever what have you

139
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,039
done today

140
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,120
this wh comes first and then you have

141
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,080
your have or

142
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,720
has and then you have your verb or how

143
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,800
many times have you been to the uk

144
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,080
again your question comes first then you

145
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,639
have has

146
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,280
a have and then you have your verb it is

147
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,280
really important to learn the word

148
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
order because when you are speaking to a

149
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,800
native speaker

150
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,479
and when your intonation isn't right

151
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,880
when your word order is not right

152
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,720
people might not understand you at all

153
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
because when you are talking to native

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,960
speakers

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,880
they are used to talking to other native

156
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,000
speakers and

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
it might be a little hard for them to

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
understand you if you have an accent or

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,440
if you're mixing up word order

160
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,960
this is why whenever you're learning

161
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,479
something please make sure you're

162
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,600
learning everything

163
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
accent word order pronunciation that's

164
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
really important in any language

165
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,240
okay when do we use present perfect we

166
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,440
use present perfect

167
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,600
to talk about actions that started in

168
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,520
the past or happened in the past

169
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,840
and still have effect on our present

170
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,759
i've lost my keys i can't enter the

171
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,400
house

172
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,319
they've missed the bus that means they

173
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,520
will be late

174
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,160
i've already eaten means i'm not hungry

175
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
so we don't care about

176
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,840
when exactly the action happened we care

177
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
about the result

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
in present i've lost my money i've lost

179
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,039
my club and now i've lost my guests

180
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
we also use present perfect when we talk

181
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
about our life experiences

182
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,120
i've been to the uk i've studied in

183
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,919
germany

184
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,080
i've done this so many times before when

185
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
you talk about your experiences

186
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
about things you've done before you use

187
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,960
present perfect

188
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,360
i've never driven before also if you

189
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,800
have an unfinished

190
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,520
time word for example this year this

191
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,080
week

192
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
today and want to talk about actions

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,440
that have happened

194
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,240
in the period that is still ongoing you

195
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
use present perfect

196
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,280
let me give you a couple of examples

197
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,560
we've already

198
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,919
prepared our car twice this year

199
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,080
oh my god and there might be another

200
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
repair coming up

201
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,280
you've already done so many things today

202
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,199
you've accomplished so much during this

203
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,479
day and you

204
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,400
still have time to do something else

205
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,160
you've already slept

206
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,360
for five hours today stop sleeping come

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:11,840
on

208
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
time to work so whenever we have this

209
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,000
ongoing time stamp

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,479
we use present perfect i've already seen

211
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,599
someone cry today

212
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,440
also quick difference between present

213
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,199
perfect and past simple

214
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,599
if you say i worked here for five years

215
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,599
that means you're still working here

216
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,000
if you say i worked here for five years

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,800
that means you're

218
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,960
no longer working here you see the

219
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,919
subtle difference

220
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,639
in using of tenses makes everything

221
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,400
completely different and gives a

222
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,479
completely different context to a person

223
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:41,599
you're talking to

224
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,680
and let me give you a quick exercise he

225
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,039
hungry in 1990

226
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,319
which tense would you use here

227
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,800
another example he

228
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,800
hungry two times

229
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,599
so in the first example you have past

230
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,240
simple

231
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
because it has a time stamp 1990. he

232
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
visited hungary in 1990 but in the

233
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,599
second sentence you don't have a

234
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,400
timestamp

235
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,160
you just have a number of times he has

236
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,680
visited hungary so

237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,879
he has visited hungary two times

238
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,879

239
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
