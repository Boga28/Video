00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm a forensic artist, worked for the San JosÃ© Police Department from 1995 to 2011.   

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,000
I showed up to a place I've never been and there was a guy with a drafting board.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
 We couldn't see them, they couldn't see us.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,500
Tell me about your hair

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,300
I didn't know what he was doing, but then I could tell after several questions that he was drawing me.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
Tell me about your chin.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,900
It kind that protrudes a little bit. Especially when I smile.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Your jaw?

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
My mom told me I had a big jaw.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,500
What would be your most prominent feature.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,700
Kinda have fat, rounded face.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,300
The older I've gotten the most freckles I've gotten. 

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,300
I would say I have a pretty big forehead.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Once I get a sketch, I say "thank you very much" and then they leave. I don't see them.

15
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,700
All I have been told before the sketch was to get friendly with this other woman: Chloe.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,300
Today I'm gonna ask you some questions about the person you met earlier and I'm gonna ask you some general questions about their face.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,600
She was thin, so you can see her cheek bones. And her chin was a nice, thin chin.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,500
She had nice eyes. They lit up when she spoke.

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,400
Cute nose.

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
She had blue eyes. Very nice blue eyes.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ok...

22
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:38,000
So here we are. This is the sketch you helped me create. And that's a sketch that somebody described of you.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yeah, that's.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She looks closed off and fatter. Sadder too. The second one looks more open. Friendly and happy.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,800
I should be more grateful of my natural beauty. It impacts the choices in friends that we make, the jobs we apply for, how we treat our children 

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,800
It impacts everything. It couldn't be more critical to your happiness.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Do you think you're more beautiful then you say?

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah. yeah.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,700
We spend a lot of time as woman analyzing and trying to fix the things that aren't quite right 

30
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,500
and should spend more time appreciating the things we do like.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
YOU ARE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU THINK.

32
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:55,000
