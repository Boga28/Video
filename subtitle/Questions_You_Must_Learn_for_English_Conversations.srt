1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,590
So, how are things with you?

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,430
That question, "So, how
are things with you?"

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,730
was a very common question that I heard

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,270
this past weekend when I was
at a little family gathering.

5
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:13,630
I tried to keep track of all the questions

6
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,820
that I heard English speakers use

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,870
when they started
conversations with each other,

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,617
and I think that one was the most common.

9
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:22,787
"So, how are things with
you?" or the shorter version,

10
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:24,430
"So, how are things?"

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,330
So in this English lesson, I
thought I would share with you

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,410
all of the different types of questions

13
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,500
that I heard at the family
gathering I was just at.

14
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,690
All of the questions that
native English speakers used

15
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:38,700
when they were starting
conversations with each other.

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,867
(gentle upbeat music)

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,190
Well, hello and welcome
to this English lesson

18
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:48,160
where I'm going to help you
learn some questions you can use

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,990
when you're having an
English conversation.

20
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,120
Before we get started, though,

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,770
if this is your first time here,

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,240
don't forget to click that red
subscribe button over there,

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,770
and give me a thumbs up if
this video helps you learn

24
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,380
just a little bit more English.

25
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,230
So the questions I'm
going to teach you today

26
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,150
are not questions you would
use with people you work with

27
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,960
or classmates at school.

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,480
You wouldn't use these questions

29
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,790
with people who you see every day,

30
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,750
these are questions you would
use to start conversations

31
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,610
with people who you
haven't seen for a few days

32
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,630
or a couple of weeks or a few months,

33
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,140
or even more than a year.

34
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,020
So these are questions that you can use

35
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,920
when you go to a family gathering.

36
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,310
They're questions you can use

37
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,850
when you see a friend who
you haven't seen for awhile.

38
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,320
And they're great questions to
use to start a conversation,

39
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,290
but they're also great questions to use

40
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,070
during the conversation.

41
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,640
So let's get started.

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,027
The first question I wanted
to teach you is the question,

43
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:40,750
"How have you been?"

44
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,427
Or we sometimes add the
word so in front and we say,

45
00:01:43,427 --> 00:01:45,190
"So, how have you been?"

46
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,230
But I'm saying it kind of slowly.

47
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,270
Here's how I would ask that
question at normal speed.

48
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,520
I would say, "So, how have you been?"

49
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,510
I kind of mush all the words together

50
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,930
at the beginning of the question.

51
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,740
So, how have you been?

52
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,230
This is a question we ask

53
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,820
when we wanna know about
someone's well-being.

54
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,400
We wanna know if they've been healthy,

55
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,350
we wanna know if they've
been enjoying life,

56
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,220
we wanna know if they've been happy.

57
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,047
So the first question you could ask is,

58
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,430
"So, how have you been?"

59
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,180
The second question I wanted to teach you

60
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,220
is the question, "What's new?"

61
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,920
Or there's actually a longer version,

62
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,690
we sometimes say, "So,
what's new with you?"

63
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,840
And again, I should say
it at full speed, right?

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,370
So, what's new with you?

65
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,390
This is a question we ask
because life continually changes.

66
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,210
If you haven't seen someone for a week,

67
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,480
or two weeks, or a month,
there's probably new things

68
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,960
that have happened in their life.

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,710
And this is a great question to ask

70
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,110
if you want to know about them.

71
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,460
So you say things like,
"Hey, so what's new?"

72
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,370
Or, "So, what's new with you?"

73
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,520
And then they might tell
you about a new car,

74
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,330
they might tell you about a new job,

75
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:47,000
they might tell you about a new baby

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,830
that's been born in their family.

77
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,370
But it's a great question to ask

78
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,870
to find out if anything new
has happened in their life.

79
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,800
The third question you could ask someone

80
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,530
to start an English conversation,

81
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,337
or even during an English
conversation, is this,

82
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:02,830
"What have you been up to lately?"

83
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,850
I actually heard this question
a lot this past weekend.

84
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,750
People would say, "Hey,
it's good to see you.

85
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,660
What have you been up to lately?"

86
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,790
Life is full of activities.

87
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,090
People have hobbies, people have jobs.

88
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,440
There are things that people do every day

89
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,520
and sometimes those things change.

90
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,770
So it was really fun to be
able to ask this question.

91
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,470
And it was fun that people
asked me this question,

92
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,840
because then you can talk about

93
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,040
the new things that
you've been doing lately.

94
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,257
So the third question you can ask,

95
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:32,180
"What have you been up to lately?"

96
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,330
And I should say it at
full speed, shouldn't I?

97
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,070
What have you been up to lately?

98
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,470
That was still a little bit slow.

99
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,960
What have you been up to lately?

100
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,680
That's how I would say it at normal speed.

101
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,670
What have you been up to lately?

102
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,360
The fourth question you can
ask is, "How are things?"

103
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,910
That's kind of the short version.

104
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,580
You could say, "So, how are things?"

105
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,840
Or, "So how are things with you?"

106
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,470
That's actually the question I used

107
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,030
when I started this video.

108
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:59,420
This is a nice general question.
It's a very broad question.

109
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,070
When you say to someone, "So,
how are things with you?"

110
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,220
they can answer by talking about work,

111
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,890
they can talk about their family,

112
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,360
they can talk about a
new car that they bought.

113
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,570
It's a really good way to
start an English conversation

114
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,320
because it allows the
person you are talking to

115
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,067
to answer in a variety of ways.

116
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:19,870
"So, how are things with
you?" Or, "So how are things?"

117
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,630
Often when talking to
a friend or a relative,

118
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,080
there are things about their life

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,490
that you already know about,

120
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,640
but you want to inquire about them,

121
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
you wanna ask questions about them.

122
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,050
And we often do this by
combining the word how with is

123
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,100
to make the contraction how's.

124
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,530
We ask questions like
this. "How's the family?

125
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,070
How's the new car? How's work?"

126
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,750
These are all questions where
you kind of need to know

127
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,650
a little bit about the person's life.

128
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,460
And you can ask these questions

129
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,720
and then they can kind
of give you an update.

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,640
I just used a question like
this this past weekend.

131
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,060
My brother-in-law, I knew
he had bought a new truck,

132
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,700
and when he was here, I
said, "How's the new truck?"

133
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,750
So you can combine how with is
to make the contraction how's

134
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,810
and ask questions about things

135
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,280
you already know a little bit about,

136
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,990
but you want to know more.

137
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,240
A sixth way to ask questions
during an English conversation

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,710
is to use the word how and was

139
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,950
to ask questions about the past.

140
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,940
You could ask questions like
this. "How was your trip?

141
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,810
How was your drive? How was your weekend?

142
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,450
How was your day off?"

143
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,310
So we use again, the
question word how with was

144
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,640
in order to ask questions

145
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,977
about things we know already happened.

146
00:05:29,977 --> 00:05:31,780
"How was your trip?"

147
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,760
Life is full of changes.

148
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,600
Maybe someone has retired,
maybe they got married,

149
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,420
maybe they had a baby,
maybe they started a new job

150
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,220
or went to university.

151
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,510
And there's a fun way of asking a question

152
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,860
about things like that.

153
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,330
You add the phrase treating
you to the end of the question.

154
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,167
So you can ask questions like this.

155
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:52,960
"How's fatherhood treating you?
How's marriage treating you?

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,530
How's that new job treating you?

157
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,410
How's retirement treating you?"

158
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,610
It's just a fun way to ask someone

159
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,850
about the change that's
happened in their life,

160
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,080
and it gives them an
opportunity to kind of explain

161
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,220
how that change has made
their life different.

162
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,600
So you can ask questions just like that.

163
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,750
I could even ask that question to you

164
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,830
about learning English.

165
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,290
I could say, "How's learning
English treating you?"

166
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,700
and you could tell me what it's like

167
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,450
to be an English student.

168
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:19,630
Well, hey, thanks for
watching this English lesson

169
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,680
where I helped you learn some
new questions you can use

170
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,060
when you have your next
English conversation.

171
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,570

174
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,010
just a little bit more English.

175
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,430
And if you have the time,
