1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,199
Score!

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,799
You just found this lesson, and this lesson
is on "score".

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,900
And you're probably confused: Why did I just
say: "Score"?

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,330
Because I say it all the time.

5
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,640
I use this when I find something that's cool
or good.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,550
So, for example, if I am walking down the
street and I see-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-20 dollars,

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,400
I go: "Score!" because I found something.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,540
"Score" is a word that has many meanings,
and I'm going to teach you what they mean

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:40,320
in slang-yes-and also what they mean in regular,
everyday language.

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,500
But slang is more fun, so let's start with
the regular, everyday language first of "score".

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,620
There's a really famous guy; he had a big
beard, a big hat.

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,970
Why do you wear such a big hat?

13
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,530
I don't know.

14
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:58,240
And his name was Abraham Lincoln or Abe Lincoln.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,280
He was a famous guy in America.

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,099
He was a president and stuff.

17
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,149
To shorten his name, we say: "Abe".

18
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:11,409
And we don't say the name like: "Linc-lon";
we say: "Lincoln", which I'm still trying

19
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,479
to work out.

20
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,209
So, Abe Lincoln said this famous quote; he
said: "Four score and seven years ago."

21
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:25,810
And maybe you know "score" means to get a
point or get a goal, and you're wondering

22
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,740
why there's four goals and then seven years.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,060
But actually, "score" meaning number one,
means 20.

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,390
So, yes, I have to do math again, but this
time I can do it.

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,979
So, if you say: "Four score", that means 20
times four, which is-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-80.

26
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,939
So-haha-four times 20 is 80.

27
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,289
So, basically, "score" means 20 of something.

28
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:59,159
You can get a score of apples, which means
20 apples.

29
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:07,250
"Four score and seven years ago"-a very famous
quote-actually means 87 years ago.

30
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:09,860
I didn't do the math, obviously.

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,090
Thanks to Josh for doing that.

32
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,090
Unh-huh.

33
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:18,560
You might know "score" if you watch sports.

34
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:27,000
So, if you watch hockey, or baseball, or any
sports, they score a goal; and this means:

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,880
When you score a goal, you get a point.

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,530
So, as a sentence, you can say: "The team
scored 10 points."

37
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,519
So they got 10 points.

38
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:37,530
Score!

39
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,439
Sometimes when people watch hockey, they'll
all of a sudden go: "Score!"

40
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,140
Right now, if you're hearing a little bit
of noise, it's because there's a hockey game

41
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,599
going on and people are going to yell.

42
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,260
Or maybe they're just crazy people.

43
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,829
Another way that we use the word "score" as
a noun is a piece of music.

44
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:06,500
There is a really fantastic movie, I think,
called Pee-wee's Big Adventure, and the soundtrack...

45
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,390
"This movie's score was written by Danny Elfman."

46
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:18,430
So, Danny Elfman is a very famous composer,
and he wrote the music or the score for Pee-wee's

47
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,810
Big Adventure.

48
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,829
Do you know that movie?

49
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:26,629
If you've never seen the movie, go; it's so
funny.

50
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,269
Don't go; Google it, look at it on your computer.

51
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:36,129
If you go to the movies, there's no movies
anymore of Pee-wee's Big Adventure; I'm sorry.

52
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,670
So it's something you're going to have to
do by yourself.

53
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,880
So, the movie's score (the movie's music)
was written by Danny Elfman.

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,170
Now that song is in my head.

55
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,849
Ding-ding-ding-ding.

56
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,170
Another thing you can do is you can score
music.

57
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,950
This means that you arrange or change the
music.

58
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,790
As an example, as a composer, I would take...

59
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:06,909
I have written music for only a violin, and
a viola, and a cello, which would be three

60
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:12,299
people playing it; but I want to make it a
quartet which has four people, so I'm going

61
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,719
to score the music to include a flute.

62
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:23,130
So: "The quartet"-which means four-"was scored
for the flute, violin, viola, and piano."

63
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:30,230
This means the music was changed or rearranged
to include another instrument.

64
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,680
Do you play an instrument?

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,590
Do you play the flute?

66
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,290
Oh.

67
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:44,600
Another way we use this is in cooking or not
in cooking, but most commonly in cooking,

68
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,690
is you make a cut or a mark on something.

69
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,360
So, you will hear maybe on cooking shows:
"She scored the roast."

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:03,190
So, a lot of the times you cut the fat of
the meat so it doesn't explode and it's delicious.

71
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:07,020
So, you can cut or mark the surface of something.

72
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,850
So, your roast looks like this, you've got
a layer of fat, and you score it.

73
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:20,830
The next one is also a verb, and... to draw
a line through writing.

74
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,650
So, maybe you have a teacher and your teacher
doesn't like what you've written, so they

75
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:31,830
get out their red pen (or in this case, a
blue pen) and they do this.

76
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,830
This is called "score".

77
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,300
So, they score out the words.

78
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,530
Now we're getting into the slang; this is
where the fun happens.

79
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:49,030
I told you that I say this a lot, and "score"
means you find something that's good.

80
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,030
Okay?

81
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,280
So if I'm walking down the street and I see
dog poo, I'm not going to yell: "Score!"

82
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,560
I'm going to say: "Ew.

83
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,720
Somebody didn't clean up their dog poo, and
this is disgusting".

84
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,370
"Score" is only if you find something that
you are excited about or that you like.

85
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,240
If you like dog poo, that's cool; just I wouldn't
really say...

86
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Whatever.

87
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,550
Please use this word to your discretion.

88
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:20,830
So, you can find money, you can find an earring,
you can find something that you've lost, you

89
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,710
can help someone find something; you say:
"Score!

90
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,710
I got it!

91
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,710
Woo-hoo!"

92
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,820
"Score" also means to have sex.

93
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,820
What?

94
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:36,330
There is a really famous American cartoon
called Beavis and Butt-Head.

95
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,330
Ha-ha.

96
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,130
I don't know if you've seen this, but they
are silly.

97
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:44,890
I think they're kind of stupid, actually,
but that's my personal opinion.

98
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,890
But they always say: "Ha-ha, you're going
to score tonight.

99
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,210
I scored last night."

100
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:56,430
So, when they say that and they say it like
this: "You are gonna", which means "going

101
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,430
to"...

102
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,960
"You're gonna score tonight!"

103
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,890
This means one of them is going to-woo-hoo-have
sex.

104
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,390
Also, you can use this in the past tense.

105
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,400
Maybe your friend says: "Yeah!

106
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:17,820
I scored last night!" and you think: "You
weren't playing baseball or hockey.

107
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,820
You weren't...

108
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,820
I...

109
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,230
I saw you yesterday, and you were hanging
out with a lovely la-...

110
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,230
Oh.

111
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,230
Oh.

112
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,750
Ah, you scored.

113
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,750
Okay."

114
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,020
You're not playing hockey.

115
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:38,550
The last meaning in the slang era is when
you get drugs.

116
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,490
So, normally if you get a prescription, you
go to the pharmacy, and you're not going to

117
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,490
say: "Score!"

118
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,890
This is for illegal street drugs.

119
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:51,020
So, you will hear people in movies: "Where
can I score some crack?"

120
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,020
Or...

121
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,170
They're saying: "Where can I get some drugs?"

122
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:57,690
You'll hear people, like: "Yeah, we scored
last night.

123
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,380
We scored weed last night."

124
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,820
Or: "We scored"...

125
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,900
I don't know; whatever you guys...

126
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,000
Whatever drugs people do.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,090
You'll hear people say: "I scored some dope,
yo".

128
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,720
"Dope" has two meanings.

129
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,550
One, it means marijuana; it also means heroin.

130
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,860
So, I don't know where that went.

131
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
That...

132
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,500
Well, it's crazy.

133
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:23,980
So, if your buddy says: "Oh, I scored last
night", you've got three options.

134
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,880
Did they get drugs?

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,870
Did they have sex?

136
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,210
Did they find something?

137
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,309
Or were they actually playing a game?

138
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,129
Video game; they scored a goal.

139
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,120
