1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,780
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,700
And terrors don't prey on innocent victims

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,980
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

4
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,340
It's been a loveless year, I'm a man of three fears

5
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,220
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:49,460
Trust me, darlin', trust me, darlin'

7
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:02,920
So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise tearing at the seams

8
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:12,960
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
I wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

9
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:23,760
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know

10
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:35,180
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

11
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:42,200
All my dreams never mean one thing

12
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,360
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?

13
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:56,560
Oh, I've been askin' for
Oh, I've been askin' for problems
Problems, problems

14
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,520
I wage my war on the world inside

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,920
take my gun to the enemy's side

16
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:18,340
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darlin')
Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darlin') for problems
Problems, problems

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:29,240
So look me in the eyes, tell me what you see
Perfect paradise tearing at the seams

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:39,380
I wish I could escape it, I don't wanna fake it
I wish I could erase it, make your heart believe

19
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:49,980
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know

20
00:02:50,020 --> 00:03:01,180
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

21
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:14,780
I can't breathe, I can't be
I can't be what you want me to be

22
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:22,600
Believe me this one time
Believe me

23
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:33,260
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know

24
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:44,340
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

25
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:57,320
Oh-oh-oh

26
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Oh Please believe me
Please believe me

27
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,270
Thank you so much for watching. I hope that you enjoyed this new cover

28
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,680
This song has been requested a lot and both me and David just fell in love with it

29
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:35,360
We kept hearing it on the radio and everywhere we went and it was just meant to be.

30
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,200

the next one

33
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,250
Some of you might have noticed the difference of sound in the piano

34
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,560
It's because I'm playing on my own grand piano that I received as a birthday gift from amazing amazing angel Alan.

35
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:03,180
