Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from  

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:10,160
SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Are you ready to have 
amazing English conversations? Yes, let's do it.  

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,280
Imagine this. You're at a party where you don't 
know anyone. Everyone's having conversations  

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,720
in English, but you don't feel super comfortable 
speaking with just anyone in English yet. Someone  

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,120
walks up to you, smiles, introduces themselves, 
and start speaking with you in English.  

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,400
They're friendly and seem genuinely interested in 
what you have to say. Before you know it, you're  

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,560
having a comfortable conversation in English. You 
may not be saying everything perfectly, but your  

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,080
new friend is encouraging you and you're saying 
things that you didn't even know that you knew  

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:01,600
how to say. You leave the party feeling happy and 
confident and proud of yourself for having such  

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,320
an amazing conversation. If you had not gone to 
that party, or if you had hidden in the bathroom,  

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,480
you would have missed out on such an amazing time.
There's a famous quote by Maya Angelou, and she  

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,560
says, "I've learned that people will forget 
what you said, people will forget what you did,  

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,520
but people will never forget how you made them 
feel." This is great news because you don't have  

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,040
to have perfect grammar, perfect vocabulary, 
perfect pronunciation when you speak. When you  

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,880
make other people feel good, you are automatically 
great at having amazing conversations. Today, I'm  

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,320
going to teach you four tips and several phrases 
so that you can make other people feel awesome  

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,000
while you're speaking with them, which also 
grows your confidence in speaking in English. 

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Tip number one for amazing conversations, is to 
compliment other people. This doesn't mean that  

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,360
you tell everyone, "You're so beautiful. You're 
handsome. Your hair is amazing. Your eyes are  

20
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,520
great." No, this doesn't mean that you are 
complementing their physical appearance.  

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,280
This means that you are showing genuine interest 
in what other people have to say. A way that you  

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,880
can show other people that you're interested in 
what they have to say, and you're saying, "Yes,  

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,400
what you're saying is interesting. I want 
to hear more about that," is by using some  

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,600
positive interjections in conversations. 
Advanced English speakers use these all the  

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,080
time and you should too. I want to teach you some 
of these positive interjections that you can use  

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,520
that tell the other person, "Hey, you're awesome. 
I want to hear more about what you have to say." 

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,800
I'm going to say each positive interjection 
two times. The first time I want you to listen,  

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,680
and the second time I want you to say it 
out loud. Imagine that you're at that party,  

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
talking with someone else who you want to 
become friends with, who you're interested in,  

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,320
and you want to show them, I'm interested in 
you. How can you compliment them with your  

31
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,640
ears? Listening to them with these interjections. 
Let's give it a try. Wow, that's so cool.  

32
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:24,720
Say it with me. Wow, that's so cool. That's 
great. That's great. I love that. I love that.  

33
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:34,080
No way, that's awesome. No way, that's awesome. 
Oh my gosh, how fun is that? Oh my gosh,  

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:44,240
how fun is that? Oh, really? Oh, really? For real, 
that's too funny. For real, that's too funny. 

35
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:51,120
Can you get the sense from all of these positive 
interjections that you're making that other person  

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,760
feel like I'm saying something that that person 
really cares about. When they say, "For real,  

37
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,480
that's too funny." It shows you're listening. It 
shows that you think they're funny and they're  

38
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,120
going to feel so good about themselves. 
You are complementing what they're saying. 

39
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:15,520
My second tip for having amazing conversations is 
to have a mindset shift. I want you to shift your  

40
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:22,880
mindset into thinking that every person you speak 
with has something interesting to say, and you  

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,920
can't wait to find out what that is. Be interested 
in other people. If you only speak about yourself,  

42
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,000
you're not a great conversationalist. If someone 
says that their car broke down and you immediately  

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,680
say, "Oh yeah, my car broke down last week too." 
How do you think that makes that other person  

44
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,400
feel? Makes them feel like, did you even hear what 
I said? Do you care about me, that my car broke  

45
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:56,240
down? Take a step back and to be interested 
in their story, be interested in their life. 

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
Have you ever been telling someone something that 
you are really excited about? Maybe you said, "Oh,  

47
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,120
I just interviewed for a new job last week 
at Google." And then the other person says,  

48
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,880
"Oh yeah, I thought about interviewing for 
there too." Well, how does that make you feel?  

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,160
Feels like they're not willing to share your 
excitement because they only want to talk  

50
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,440
about themselves. "Oh yeah. I interviewed 
there too." Well, you don't want to be that  

51
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,320
kind of person. You want to take interest 
in what other people have to say and think,  

52
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,520
well, other people have something that I am 
curious about and I can't wait to learn more. 

53
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,200
I'd like to give you some phrases 
that you can use to show that you're  

54
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,640
genuinely interested in what other people have to 
say. Like before, I'm going to say them two times,  

55
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,840
first time you can listen, and the second time say 
it with me. Speak out loud. How did that happen?  

56
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:55,040
How did that happen? What was that like? What 
was that like? What do you think will happen?  

57
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,080
What do you think will happen? What made you want 
to do that? What made you want to do that? Have  

58
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,240
you always been interested in that? Have you 
always been interested in that? Great, these  

59
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,760
phrases show that you are genuinely interested in 
what the other person has to say. Great. You're  

60
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:20,720
on your way to having amazing conversations.
Tip number three for having amazing conversations  

61
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:28,000
is to listen actively. Listen actively, but 
listening is usually a passive thing, you're just  

62
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,400
taking in input. But really active listening means 
that you are either guessing the emotion of the  

63
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,480
other person or you're mirroring their words. This 
is actually excellent for learning English because  

64
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,640
you're taking their words and you're restating 
it so you might be growing some new vocabulary,  

65
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,520
growing some new grammar based on what the other 
person said. Let me give you a couple examples.  

66
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:02,160
If you work in customer service and someone calls 
your customer service line and says, "This product  

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,280
broke, I can't believe it." You might say, 
"Oh, I'm sorry. You must be really frustrated."  

68
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,080
But they say, "No, I'm just disappointed 
because I thought that it would work." 

69
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,120
Well. What word did they use that you didn't 
use? You said, "You must be frustrated," and  

70
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,880
they said, "No, I'm just disappointed." 
Great chance for active listening.  

71
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,960
You can say, "I'm sorry that you're so 
disappointed. Let me do what I can to  

72
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,880
make it right." You're mirroring their word and it 
makes them feel heard. You're actively listening  

73
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,360
to the words that they're using and you're able 
to use it yourself to reflect their feelings.  

74
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,280
This is a great type of listening and phrasing 
to use. When someone's telling you something that  

75
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,240
there's a lot of emotion behind, it could be 
positive emotion, it could be something they're  

76
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,520
worried or fearful about, this type of negative 
emotion. Here are some sample phrases that you  

77
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,000
can use so that you show that you're listening 
actively to someone else. That other person feels  

78
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,960
good that you really heard what they had to say.
You can say, "You must be feeling," and then add  

79
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,840
some kind of emotion. You must be feeling 
really excited about that job interview.  

80
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,320
You must be feeling really nervous to approach 
your boss. You must be feeling really upset that  

81
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,000
that happened. Oh, well maybe they didn't 
say specifically excited, worried, upset,  

82
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,120
but you are guessing their emotion. Maybe they'll 
correct you and say, "Ah, actually I just feel  

83
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,120
hesitant. I feel really disappointed." Okay. 
That's all right. You can mirror that back. "Yeah.  

84
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,160
That's so disappointing." But when you are trying 
to actively listen and pull out their emotion,  

85
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:57,520
excellent, you are a wonderful conversationalist.
Let me give you some phrases. That must be really  

86
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,840
nerve wracking. That must be really exciting. 
That must be really awful. That must be... Can  

87
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:12,640
you practice that with me? That must be really 
wracking. That must be really exciting. That  

88
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,920
must be really awful. Our final phrase for active 
listening is, that sounds really nerve wracking.  

89
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:29,040
That sounds really exciting. That sounds really 
awful. Here you're trying to pull that emotion  

90
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,240
out of it and connect with the other person. 
Can you say that with me? That sounds really  

91
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,800
nerve wracking. That sounds really exciting. 
Oh, that sounds really awful. Excellent work. 

92
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,920
A little bonus tip, this works very well with 
children. If you have young kids, I guess any  

93
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,440
kids, if you work with kids, you see kids, you 
know that kids exist. I recommend this book, How  

94
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,880
To Talk So Kids Will Listen, How To Listen So Kids 
Will Talk. They also have a teenage version as  

95
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,600
well, I think. It's a great way to be able to use 
active listening at an age appropriate level so  

96
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,160
that your kids feel heard. Also so that your kids 
hear you and hear you in the way that you want  

97
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:17,600
them to hear. Great book, great recommendation.
Okay. Let's go to our fourth and final tip  

98
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:25,920
for amazing English conversations. Tip number four 
for amazing conversations is body language. You  

99
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,320
can have all the right words, all the right 
things to say, but if your body is like,  

100
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:41,040
well, you know what that tells the other person. I 
don't really care what you have to say. Yeah. I'm  

101
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,040
just kind of bored. So instead as you are 
having a conversation with someone else,  

102
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:55,200
I want you to remember NOSE. Your nose? No. 
Instead, this is an acronym, N-O-S-E. We'll  

103
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,160
talk about it in just a second. Remember 
NOSE as you are speaking with someone else. 

104
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,200
N is nodding. Nodding. If you're speaking and 
someone just stands there and doesn't move,  

105
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,720
it seems a little robotic, a little bit like 
they're not listening or they don't care.  

106
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,880
Makes you feel a little uncomfortable. So if 
you just nod while someone else is speaking,  

107
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,040
oh, it shows that you're listening. It doesn't 
mean you always agree with them, but it shows  

108
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:31,040
that you're listening. You're nodding. What 
about O? O is for open posture. Which one feels  

109
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,240
better to you? Me with my arms crossed maybe 
turned away from you or me with my arms down  

110
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:45,360
and just listening to you? When your body is 
open, you don't need to be very open or like this.  

111
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,080
Instead, just having an open posture, your 
shoulders back, and you're facing someone.  

112
00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:00,640
This shows that care and that you're listening.
The S of NOSE is smile. Did you know that our  

113
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:06,320
brains can tell if a smile is real 
or not? When you smile like this?  

114
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,440
Yes, my mouth is making a smiling face, but it's 
not real. Could you tell? Could you tell that I  

115
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,480
wasn't really smiling? I was just fake smiling. 
Well, the reason why we can tell is because my  

116
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,760
eyes are not doing anything. A real smile goes 
all the way up to your eyes. If I smile like this,  

117
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,440
do you see how my eyes are crinkling a little 
bit, maybe even completely crinkling. That  

118
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,200
means that it is a real smile, that we are really 
interested. So as someone is speaking, you can be  

119
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,080
completely, really interested in what they have 
to say. Not just, it feels like a robot, right?  

120
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,880
But when you're really interested in what someone 
has to say, oh, yeah, your eyes crinkle a little  

121
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:09,520
bit and you smile all the way up to your eyes.
The final E of NOSE is eye contact. In English,  

122
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:17,200
in the US it is common and important to maintain 
eye contact with someone when you're speaking.  

123
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,680
You don't need to stare at them the whole time 
and never look away. But if you avoid eye contact,  

124
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,960
as someone's speaking, it makes them feel like 
you don't want to be there, you don't want to  

125
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:35,360
talk with them. So instead, if you look them in 
the eyes and you smile and you nod and you have  

126
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,000
open posture, you are a welcoming and inviting 
person who anyone would want to speak with. 

127
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,840
So maintain some eye contact. Maybe if that's 
tough for you, you can focus here or focus on  

128
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:54,000
one eye over the other. You don't need to stress 
yourself out too much, but having that kind of  

129
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,560
nodding, genuine smile, open posture and 
maintaining eye contact, that is a great way  

130
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,920
to have excellent conversations. Well, now, 
when you compliment others, having mindset  

131
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,480
shift that other people have interesting things 
to say, and you listen actively and have great  

132
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,880
body language, well, congratulations, you 
have the power to have amazing conversations,  

133
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,240
great relationships and confidence in 
yourself. Pretty good for a free YouTube video.

00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:43,440

man, he's a great conversationalist. No, 
she is great at having conversations,

Now I have a question for you. I'd like to give  

140
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,840
you a little scenario. Imagine that I told you, 
"I can't wait, I get to see my grandma next week  

141
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:11,360
for the first time in a year." What would you say 
to me? Can you use any of these phrases, maybe an  

142
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,760
active listening phrase, you must be feeling 
or one of the other phrases so that you can  

143
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,440
be a great conversationalist? Let me know in the 
comments how you would respond to me. If I said,  

144
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,800
"I get to see my grandma next week after a 
full year of not seeing her." Let me know in  

145
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,160
the comments what you would say, use what you've 
learned and I'll see you again next Friday for a
