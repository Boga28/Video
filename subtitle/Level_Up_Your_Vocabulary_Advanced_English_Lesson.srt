00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:04,960
Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,350
Are you ready to level up your English?

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,850
Let's do it.

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,380
Drum roll.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,280
Come away with me and fly to amazing English
land today.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,140
Have you ever felt like you use the same English
phrases again and again and again, or have

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,410
you ever watched an English movie or TV show
and thought, "Man, I would love to speak English

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,410
like that."

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,850
Well, never fear.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,300
Today, I'm going to help you level up your
English by changing some common English phrases

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,649
into more advanced wonderful English idioms
that native English speakers often use in

12
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,219
daily conversation, but I don't often hear
English learners use.

13
00:00:55,219 --> 00:00:58,239
So you will be able to use them in this lesson.

14
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,149
And to help you understand all of these expressions
and continue to remember them so that you

15
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,479
can use them when you go out into the real
world, I've created a free PDF worksheet for

16
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,479
you.

17
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,749
In this worksheet, you can learn the more
common phrases changed into advanced beautiful

18
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:19,119
phrases and also some sample sentences.

You can click on the link in the description
to download the free worksheet, put it under

21
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,719
your pillow as you sleep, and soak in English.

22
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:32,719
All right.

23
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:38,389
Are you ready to get started learning these
wonderful English phrases, including one that

24
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,999
apparently I've been using wrong my whole
life?

25
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:44,630
And I just found it out as I was making this
lesson.

26
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,049
All right, let's get started.

27
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:51,740
The conversation was confusing.

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,289
The conversation was all over the map.

29
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,740
Oh, much better.

30
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:04,119
This idiom, "all over the map" means that
there is no logic, no flow, it jumps from

31
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,189
one idea to the other.

32
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:08,519
It is all over the map.

33
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:11,390
It's pretty confusing and difficult to understand.

34
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,060
Man, that conversation was all over the map.

35
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,260
I'm learning about these English idioms.

36
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,860
I'm trying to get the hang of it.

37
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,840
Oh, much better.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,650
This idiom, "to get the hang of it" means
that you're learning something new and you're

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,810
trying to become more comfortable with it.

40
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,980
When you're going from beginner to intermediate
to advanced, well, you are trying to get the

41
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,730
hang of English so that you can speak comfortably.

42
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,730
Excellent.

43
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,170
Get the hang of it.

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,110
Summer is almost over.

45
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,170
Before you know it, it will be fall.

46
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,170
Ooh.

47
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:59,109
Before you know it, this is an excellent English
idiom and it means something will happen soon

48
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:01,239
or almost immediately.

49
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,550
Before you know it.

50
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:08,299
Oh, it's going to happen so soon that I won't
even have time to think about it.

51
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:09,299
You know what?

52
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,900
Before you know it, you are going to be speaking
English confidently.

53
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,230
One day you'll just keep practicing and practicing
and then, "Oh, I didn't even realize it, but

54
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,299
my confidence has been growing."

55
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:24,060
Before you know it, you will be speaking English
confidently.

56
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,019
Wow, they really like each other.

57
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:32,620
Wow, they are head over heels for each other.

58
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,019
This is a fun English idiom that means you
are completely in love with someone.

59
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,840
To be head over heels.

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,569
We can imagine when you fall in love, your
head and your heels are switching positions.

61
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:54,340
So they are head over heels for each other.

62
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,340
Completely in love.

63
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,939
What a wonderful phrase.

64
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:02,050
Let me know if your plans change.

65
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,420
Keep me posted.

66
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,110
Keep me in the loop.

67
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,480
All those are great phrases.

68
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,330
Keep me posted.

69
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:16,320
We can imagine a poster with some announcement
on it or keep me in the loop.

70
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,180
Here we have a circle and there is some important
information inside that circle, that's kind

71
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,470
of the literal meaning of this figurative
idiom.

72
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,160
Can you imagine it means to get some updates
about something, to make sure that I have

73
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,710
the most recent information.

74
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:41,630
We often use this for events, maybe for someone's
health condition, if your friend just had

75
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,470
a baby and you say, "Hey, I'm going to bring
you some food so that you have dinner tonight,

76
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,210
but keep me posted and let me know if you
need anything else."

77
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,210
Okay.

78
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,620
Keep me posted.

79
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,910
They're not going to send you a poster, but
it means they'll just text you with some updates.

80
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,050
"Hey, could you come over and hold my baby
while I take a shower?"

81
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,050
Oh, this is great.

82
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,930
This is an update about what's going on or
we could just exchange it with the other phrase.

83
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,789
"Hey, can you keep me in the loop?

84
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:11,940
Just keep me in the loop.

85
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,740
Let me know if you need anything and make
sure I have some updates."

86
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,740
Excellent.

87
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,500
The students didn't get in trouble.

88
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,349
The teacher let them off the hook.

89
00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:31,379
Ooh, this fun English idiom, "let someone
off the hook," we can imagine a fish.

90
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,289
You caught a fish and it doesn't seem like
good news for that fish, right?

91
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:38,139
He's about to be eaten.

92
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:44,289
But if you let him off the hook, if you take
him off the hook and throw him back into the

93
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,370
water, he's free.

94
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,300
And this is the same idea here.

95
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,990
The students did something not so great and
the teacher did not punish them.

96
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,690
Instead, the teacher let them off the hook.

97
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:05,990
Oh, what a wonderful English idiom that means
you don't get in trouble.

98
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,639
The consequences are less than you thought.

99
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:15,270
Oh, I didn't think they would let me off the
hook, but I'm free.

100
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,360
Excellent.

101
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,740
How are you doing?

102
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,270
I'm having a pretty good day today.

103
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,800
How are you doing today?

104
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
So far so good.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,680
Oh, that's a great expression.

106
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,680
When someone asks you, "How are you doing?"

107
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,780
You can say, "So far so good."

108
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,740
This is a great way to respond to this common
question.

109
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,980
And in fact, it's a little bit funny too,
because it kind of implies that everything

110
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:47,750
is going well so far, but at any time something
bad could happen.

111
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,410
So it's not a perfectly optimistic phrase.

112
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,169
It's kind of a realistic phrase with a little
bit of humor.

113
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,599
How are you doing?

114
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,680
So far so good.

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Great.

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,150
At any time something terrible could happen,
but right now everything is great.

117
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,400
So far so good.

118
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Excellent.

119
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,599
I hope you can use this in your daily conversations.

120
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,260
Oh, hey, I was just talking about you.

121
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,470
Speak of the devil.

122
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,370
Oh, much better.

123
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:23,280
This phrase, "speak of the devil" is used
when you're talking about someone and then

124
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,650
they walk in the room.

125
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,160
Oh, speak of the devil.

126
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,710
Are you calling your friend the devil?

127
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,230
No, you are not implying that they are bad
or evil.

128
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,530
This is just an idiom that shows we were talking
about you and then there you are.

129
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,830
It's kind of like magic.

130
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,919
All of a sudden he appears.

131
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,910
So I would recommend using this in casual
situations with friends.

132
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,750
And usually if you say this, they will wonder,
"What were they saying about me?"

133
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,590
So if you are saying something secretive about
that person, maybe don't use this phrase.

134
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,560
You don't want them to know that you were
talking about them.

135
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,819
But if you say, "Oh, speak of the devil, there
he is."

136
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:11,930
Well, you might need to explain, "Oh, we were
talking about your birthday party last week

137
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,240
and how much fun it was."

138
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,210
You're going to need to explain a little bit
what you were talking about.

139
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,669
But you know what?

140
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:27,479
Sometimes this phrase is said "speaking of
the devil" and this phrase I found out is

141
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:31,389
technically wrong, but that's what I say.

142
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:37,179
I say "speaking of the devil" and actually
that's what my son says too because that's

143
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,709
what I say.

144
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:44,910
So one time I heard my four year old son say,
"Speaking of the devil," and I thought, "What?

145
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:47,190
How did he learn that phrase?"

146
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,040
And then I realized, "Oh, that's what I say."

147
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,230
So when I say this phrase, I add I-N-G, speaking
of the devil.

148
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:02,250
But as I was doing a little bit of research
about this, I realized I'm wrong.

149
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:08,900
So instead it should be "speak of the devil",
but you will hear people say, "speaking of

150
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,450
the devil".

151
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,940
Technically it's incorrect, but you will hear
people say that like me and you know what?

152
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,320
It's okay.

153
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,340
We get the same meaning and you know what?

154
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,950
Let's just roll with it.

155
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,370
Speak of the devil.

156
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,150
Speaking of the devil, there he is.

157
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,620
That's true, I agree.

158
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,260
You could say that again.

159
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,320
Oh, what a great phrase.

160
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,080
You could say say that again.

161
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,380
This is a rhetorical statement.

162
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,080
You're not actually asking someone to repeat
themselves.

163
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,850
Instead, you are emphasizing that you absolutely
agree with them.

164
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,560
Maybe if someone says, "Oh, it is so hot today."

165
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,170
You could say, "You could say that again."

166
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,510
Or if someone says, "Oh, this cake is amazing".

167
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,001
What can you say?

168
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,550
"You could say that again."

169
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,080
That means I absolutely agree with you.

170
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,440
It's so hot today.

171
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,130
This cake is amazing.

172
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,060
You could say that again.

173
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,260
And they don't need to repeat it, but it just
means, I definitely agree with you.

174
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,760
This lesson is so helpful.

175
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,180
You could say that again.

176
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,380
I hope so.

177
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,800
I can't believe it.

178
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,600
I can't understand it.

179
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,310
I can't wrap my head around it.

180
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,750
I can't wrap my brain around it.

181
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,470
Oh, what a lovely expression.

182
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:39,290
The idea of wrapping your head or your brain
around something just means to understand

183
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,290
something.

184
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:47,870
But we often use this English idiom for tragic
events or something that is really difficult

185
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,200
to comprehend.

186
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,990
So for example, recently there were some bad
floods in Europe and in China and for these

187
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:04,350
tragic events, especially when you're watching
it on the news, sometimes it's hard to comprehend.

188
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,350
I'm not there.

189
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,330
I'm not experiencing that in person, so we
could use this type of phrase.

190
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:16,270
It's really hard to wrap your brain around
the kind of tragedy and the kind of damage

191
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:19,260
that's happening because of the floods.

192
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:25,600
It's hard to wrap your head around something
because you seem removed from it.

193
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,670
It's too tragic to handle.

194
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:34,440
So we can use this expression, "I just can't
wrap my brain around it", but we can also

195
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,240
use it for simple things too, like if you
are looking at a math problem and it's extremely

196
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,690
complicated.

197
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:46,380
You can say, "Oh, I just can't wrap my brain
around this problem.

198
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,830
I don't think I'm ever going to solve it."

199
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,590
So we can use it for these big events or for
simple problems.

200
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:59,160
On the other hand, it's not hard to figure
out.

201
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,050
It's not rocket science.

202
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,100
Oh, much better.

203
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,880
We're not actually talking about becoming
a rocket scientist.

204
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,830
Instead, we're talking about something that's
not complicated and we almost always use this

205
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,110
idiom with the word not.

206
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,690
It's not rocket science.

207
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,810
Let me give you a couple of examples because
sometimes this can be used to encourage and

208
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,920
sometimes this can be used to make fun of
someone.

209
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,870
So I want to make sure that you use it and
you understand how it's being used in that

210
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,180
correct way.

211
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:42,190
Last week when the gate on my deck broke,
my mom was with me and I said, "We can fix

212
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,190
it.

213
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,510
It isn't rocket science, right?"

214
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,520
"Yeah, let's figure out how to fix this."

215
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:54,800
So here I'm just trying to encourage myself
and encourage my mom that this project is

216
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,340
not too complicated.

217
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,660
It isn't rocket science, right?

218
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,250
We can do this.

219
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,870
It seems like it might be challenging, but
no, it's not rocket science.

220
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,870
We got this.

221
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,870
We can do it.

222
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,070
So that's kind of an encouraging way to use
this, but we can also use this to make fun

223
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,660
of someone too.

224
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,670
Let's imagine that my mom was trying to fix
the gate and she said, "Oh, I just can't figure

225
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,050
out how to fix the gate."

226
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,990
What if I said to her, "It isn't rocket science.

227
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,230
You can do it."

228
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:33,100
Can you tell by the tone in my voice, I'm
kind of making fun of the fact that she can't

229
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,750
figure out that simple thing?

230
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,570
It isn't rocket science.

231
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,200
You can do it.

232
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:45,570
So here be careful using this in those types
of situations where you're not participating.

233
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,570
If you're just telling someone, "You can do
it, it's not rocket science."

234
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,570
You're kind of saying, "Hey, why can't you
figure that out?

235
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,570
Are you dumb?

236
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,570
Because it's not rocket science.

237
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,970
It's a really simple thing."

238
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,120
But if you're participating in the activity
and you're encouraging yourself too, "All

239
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,320
right, we can do this.

240
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,810
It's not rocket science.

241
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,140
We got this."

242
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,070
That's no problem, but make sure that you
don't just tell this to someone with that

243
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,400
kind of sneer.

244
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,950
It's not rocket science.

245
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,680
You can do it.

246
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,980
Make sure that you don't say it like that
unless you really want to express yourself

247
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
in that way.

248
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,930
All right, let's go to our next phrase.

249
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm finished with work.

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,640
Let's call it a day.

251
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,700
Oh, excellent.

252
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:38,350
Let's call it a day or I'm going to call it
a day just means I'm finished with work and

253
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,050
I'm going to go home or I'm going to finish.

254
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:47,070
This is an extremely common phrase in the
office or in a work culture.

255
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,170
We often say, "Let's call it a day.

256
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,170
Let's call it a day.

257
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,500
It's been so long.

258
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,750
I'm going to call it a day.

259
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,870
I'm done with this project for now."

260
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,870
Excellent.

261
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,540
To call it a day means I'm all done.

262
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,350
I'm finished and I'll start working again
another time.

263
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,350
Excellent.

264
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,410
Let's call it a day.

265
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,660
That is so irritating.

266
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:14,730
That is so annoying.

267
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,160
That ruffles my feathers.

268
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,760
Oh, what a lovely expression.

269
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,750
We can imagine a bird.

270
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,230
When a bird is angry, it's feathers kind of
puff up a little bit.

271
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,110
That's kind of ruffling its feathers.

272
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,480
It's getting irritated and annoyed about something.

273
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,350
Well, we can imagine you are like that bird.

274
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,720
You're irritated and annoyed.

275
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:45,030
One time I went to a fireworks show and we
were waiting for the fireworks to start, waiting

276
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,100
for the sun to set a little bit.

277
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,890
And there was a mother with a couple children
and the mother kept telling her kids, "Sit

278
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:52,890
still.

279
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:53,890
Stop fidgeting.

280
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:54,890
Be quiet."

281
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,500
And then she just looked at her phone.

282
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,250
She is doing something to pass the time until
the fireworks start, but she's not letting

283
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:10,470
her kids do something to pass the time, like
moving around and fidgeting.

284
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:16,850
This type of unfairness, especially to children
really ruffles my feathers.

285
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:24,160
Having more equal standards or understanding
the situation of children is a nice thing

286
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,780
to do.

287
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,970
So when there is unfairness towards children,
that really ruffles my feathers.

288
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:34,790
That makes me feel irritated and annoyed.

289
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:40,470
