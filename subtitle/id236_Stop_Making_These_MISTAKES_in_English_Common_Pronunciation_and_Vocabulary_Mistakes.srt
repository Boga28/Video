1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
1: I'm going to make some exercises 
before breakfast tomorrow. 

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:11,100
2: Oh, you mean you're going to do some exercises?
1: Right. Thanks. And after that,  

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:17,094
I’m going to do a quick meal.
2: Well, you make a meal, so that's incorrect! 

4
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:24,172
1: Oh okay! After eating, I'll 
probably… make the cleaning in my room. 

5
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:31,980
2: Hmm, you will DO the cleaning, not make.
1: So confusing! Now I’m going to DO a phone call 

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:38,280
2: You make a phone call, not do!
"Hello, everyone! I’m Kate and this  

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,860
is English Lessons with Kate channel. Today 
we're going to talk about the most common  

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,160
mistakes in English. Let's go!"
Mistake #1: 'Make' vs. 'Do' 

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,580
"Make" and "do" are both action words in English. 
They can be tricky for people learning English  

10
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:04,440
because sometimes they are used in similar ways.
"Do" is often used when talking about work, jobs,  

11
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:13,740
or tasks. For example. Do your homework. I need to 
do the laundry. She does a lot of work every day. 

12
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,580
Actions that are regular 
or routine often use "do." 

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:25,320
For example. I do the dishes every 
evening. He does the shopping on Saturdays. 

14
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,700
"Make" is used when we 
create or produce something. 

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,020
For example: She made a cake for my birthday. 
They are making a documentary about wildlife. 

16
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,440
When an action results in a specific 
outcome, we use "make". Make a  

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,860
decision. Make a mistake. Make a promise.
Let’s move on to the next mistake which my  

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,660
students make all the time.
Mistake #2: Hair vs Hairs 

19
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:02,160
1. Your hairs are so long! "How did you grow….?”
2. Hair, not hairs. Actually,  

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,240
you should say 'Your hair is so long.'
1. But why? You have so many hair?... 

21
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,440
2. You cannot say – MANY 
hair. Hair is uncountable. 

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,560
What?
When we talk  

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:24,480
about all the hair on someone's head, we just 
say "hair". "Your hair is long." Short hair,  

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:34,020
curly hair, straight hair. BUT If we are talking 
about a few pieces of hair, then we say "hairs".  

25
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:41,220
Like, "There are some hairs on your shirt."
So, "Your hairs are so long!" is not right.  

26
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:47,580
It should be "Your hair is so long!"
 
Now let’s talk about pronunciation  

27
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:55,080
mistakes. Mistake #3: Silent Letters
Another common pronunciation mistake is:  

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,760
Pronouncing Silent Letters
1 - I need to cut these apples.  

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,820
Give me a knife please.
2 -Sorry, what? 

30
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,740
1 -A knife
2 - Oh, you mean a knife. The k is silent. 

31
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,656
1 -Yes, a knife
2 - Now I'm going to.... Knead the dough.

32
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:18,180
1 - What? It's correct to say nead the dough...
2 – Yeah, to knead the dough 

33
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,460
The letter K before N is not 
pronounced. Like in such words  

34
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:32,040
as – knock, knight, knees, know and so on.
What about this word? How would you read it? It’s  

35
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,580
not salmon, it’s salmon. Mispronouncing ‘Salmon’ 
is also a very popular mistake. In this case,  

36
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:43,980
we kept the silent 'l'. The same rule is 
for the words – calm, almond, palm, half.

37
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:51,180
Mistake #4: Confusing ‘V’ and ‘W’
This one's tricky for many of my  

38
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:03,120
students! vent vs. went , veer vs. weer , 
vow vs. wow Can you hear the difference? The  

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,680
difference lies in the position of your teeth 
and lips. When you pronounce V sound, you bite  

40
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:20,579
your bottom lip with your upper teeth. When you 
pronounce W sound, you make your lips round [w]. 

41
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:28,619
It’s very important to work on your pronunciation. 
And now I want to show you guys an amazing app for  

42

61
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,040
Let’s move on to the next common 
mistake. Pronouncing ‘Colonel’ 

62
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:54,240
‘This word’ may look like 'col-o-nel' 
but surprise! It's 'KER-nel'. English  

63
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,360
borrowed words from various languages.
The word "colonel" originates from French.  

64
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,620
In the word "colonel," we don't say the 
"o" or the second "l". We say an "r" sound,  

65
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,480
even though it's not in the word. 
An odd one, but now you know! 

66
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:20,100
Mistake #6: Mispronouncing 'th'
Well guys, how would you read this word?  

67
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:29,220
It’s not zing and it’s not ding but THING. We put 
the tongue against the upper teeth and blowing  

68
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,960
out. Thing. I hear that mistake very often.
What about this word? It's not 'zat' or 'dat'  

69
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,620
but 'that', /ð/ with the tongue against the 
upper teeth. We make a voiced sound /ð/.

70
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,980
Mistake #7: Mispronouncing ‘Comfortable’ 

71
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:52,860
While the word looks like it should be 
'com-for-ta-ble', the common and more  

72
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:58,320
natural pronunciation is "kʌmf-t'-b'l"
This is a very common pronunciation  

73
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,040
mistake. After a long day, I love 
sitting in my comfortable chair to relax.

74
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,360
Mistake #8: ‘Dessert’ vs ‘Desert’
What do you call this? Is it a desert  

75
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:14,640
or a dessert? This is a dessert. A sweet food 
that you eat after the main part of a meal. 

76
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:22,500
And this is a desert. A large, dry area of 
land with very few plants and little rainfall. 

77
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,300
Have you ever made this mistake? If 
you have, let me know in the comments.

78
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,260
Mistake #9: ‘Borrow’ vs ‘Lend’
English learners often confuse  

79
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:40,860
these two words. “Can I lend your book?’ 
This is a classic mistake! Remember,  

80
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:46,740
'borrow' means you take something, 
and 'lend' means you give something." 

81
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,760
"Can I BORROW your book?" 
- "I'll LEND you my book." 

82
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,140
Mistake #10: ‘Effect’ vs. ‘Affect’
They sound similar. Easy to confuse,  

83
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:05,220
but here's a clue: 'A' for action, so 'affect' 
is usually the verb. On the other hand,  

84
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,200
'effect' is the end result or outcome." For 
example, have you ever heard about domino effect? 

85
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:21,780
One domino falls, and it makes the others fall 
too. That's the effect. If you take out a domino,  

86
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:28,380
it will affect how the remaining dominoes 
fall, possibly stopping the chain reaction.

87
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,160
Mistake #11: ‘Your’ vs. ‘You’re’
This mistake deals with spelling  

88
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:41,700
and writing. 'You’re' is a contraction 
of 'you are'. Apostrophes often indicate  

89
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,700
that something is missing. You’re a 
student. You’re the smartest student. 

90
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:56,220
'Your' is all about possession. Your 
goal is to write English words correctly. 

91
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:03,720
It's your choice to understand the difference.
Mistake #12: 'Then' vs. 'Than'  

92
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:12,540
This is a common spelling mistake. "‘Then’ relates 
to time, while ‘than’ is used for comparisons. 

93
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:23,220
She’s taller THAN her brother. We’re comparing.
I’ll call you THEN. We’re talking about time.
