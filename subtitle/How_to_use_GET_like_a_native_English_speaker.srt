00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:02,639
Hi, I'm Ronnie.

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,460
Um, and - Oh, wow!

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,040
I got a balloon!

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,490
Woo-hoo!

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,390
Thank you!

6
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,690
Who gave me a balloon?

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,190
I got a balloon, I got a balloon, I'm so happy!

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,610
Balloons are the best, yeah?

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:25,300
You can hit people on the head with them and
just have a really great time with a balloon.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,360
But there's something that I need to talk
to you guys about, something quite serious,

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
actually.

12
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,000
A lot of people ask me about very formal English.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,140
Changing their formal vocabulary into less
formal or informal or, even if you wanted

14
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,000
to, you could say slang, but it's not really
slang.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,469
Unfortunately, I've noticed that what we do
with our English language is we completely

16
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,040
dumb it down.

17
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,069
If you dumb something down, it means you make
it easier or dumber.

18
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,499
No.

19
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:13,259
And what happens is we take beautiful verbs
that you might have in your language, or very

20
00:01:13,259 --> 00:01:18,340
similar, and we just replace them with the
verb "get" or "got".

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,790
So, people who are learning English find it
really difficult, because native speakers

22
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,110
always say "got".

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,159
I got this.

24
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,159
Did you get it?

25
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:28,840
Oh, I got this.

26
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:37,549
But actually, "got" has many different meanings,
and we're replacing our verbs with one verb.

27
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:40,009
So, this gets easier.

28
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,159
Maybe you can replace all of the verbs with
"got"!

29
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,119
Nah, it's not going to work.

30
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,990
But I'm going to teach you really, really
specific examples that I hear all the time.

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,979
In reverse, if you think that maybe your English
is a little bit informal and you would like

32
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:05,090
to focus on learning more formal English,
you can replace your wonderful use of the

33
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:11,840
word "got" or "get" to more exclusive verbs.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,450
So, let's go.

35
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,730
Formal to informal, featuring the verb "get".

36
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,320
And first of all, we've got to look at the
forms of the verb "get".

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,200
In the simple present, we have "get".

38
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,970
The past tense is "got", so I got a balloon.

39
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,970
The past participle, which we would use with
present perfect or past perfect or in the

40
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,740
passive voice, we would say "gotten".

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,150
You can also just say "got".

42
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,470
Trick.

43
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,320
And we can also use with -ing if we use an
adjective.

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,150
For example, I can say, "I'm getting a cold,
achoo!"

45
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:02,100
Maybe tomorrow, getting a cold, but I got
a balloon, yeah, I got a balloon!

46
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,320
Okay, calm down, Ronnie.

47
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Concentrate.

48
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:10,980
So, you guys will say something like, "Oh,
yesterday, I received an email."

49
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,120
And I'll be like "Ah, did you get my email?"

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,590
So, instead of the word "received", for an
email or a letter, we would say "got".

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,170
Now, notice this is the past tense, so we'd
say, "I got an email".

52
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,210
She bought a ticket.

53
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,840
Look at this pronunciation, be careful.

54
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,900
It looks like "bogeta", but it's actually
just "bought".

55
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,260
You can remember it like "robot".

56
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:43,640
So, in informal English, we don't say "Oh,
you know, I went online and I bought a ticket."

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,690
We would say, "Ah, I got a ticket."

58
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,610
This one is a very, very common one that,
oh, freaks me out how often people use this.

59
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,880
If you say, "They arrived home at 7."

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,390
Oh, you mean you got home at 7?

61
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,260
Because that's how I would say it more naturally.

62
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,120
So, you can definitely say these verbs, received,
bought, arrived.

63
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,649
But you have to understand that native speakers,
we replace with the verb "got", because all

64
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,149
of these are past tense, okay?

65
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,628
So, be careful of your tenses.

66
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:24,129
This is an example of using the negative,
okay?

67
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:30,219
So, I can say, "He didn't understand the joke."

68
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,610
But I would say, "Oh, you know what?

69
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,099
He didn't get my joke."

70
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:43,580
Remember, when you're using the negative in
the past, your verb is going to be still the

71
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
simple present.

72
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,650
So, we're going to say "He didn't get the
joke".

73
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,729
Maybe the joke wasn't funny.

74
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:52,139
Okay.

75
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:53,189
This is fun too.

76
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:56,650
"I developed a rash."

77
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,720
So, a rash is - hello, balloon.

78
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,860
A rash is when your skin, when it gets really
itchy and red spots and you gotta scratch

79
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,860
it?

80
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,860
That's a rash.

81
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,159
You can also develop a tan.

82
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,280
Or like me, you can get a sunburn.

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,199
So, a tan is when the sun makes your skin
darker.

84
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:20,550
Which most people like.

85
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,629
I'm a vampire though, right?

86
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:25,199
So, I don't get a tan.

87
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,449
So, very formally, we'd say, "I developed
a tan.

88
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:33,009
I developed a rash from eating too many pistachios".

89
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:41,639
But normally, in very informal English, we'd
say, "I got a rash from eating all the nuts."

90
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,180
This is an example of when we're using an
adjective.

91
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,659
Now, this is a verb, a rash, a tan, the joke.

92
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,000
These guys are all nouns.

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,629
So, be careful with your grammar.

94
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:57,650
"I'm", you have to say the verb "to be".

95
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,960
"I'm becoming mad."

96
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,469
So, maybe you're trying to express your emotion.

97
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:08,509
When we talk about our emotion, our emotions
in English are usually adjectives.

98
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:11,419
Hungry, sad, happy.

99
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,529
So, we wouldn't say, "You know what?

100
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:16,289
I'm becoming hungry."

101
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:19,710
We would say, "I'm getting hungry".

102
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:25,190
So, we're going to use the verb in the -ing,
because we're using it with an adjective.

103
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,900
So, I'm getting hungry.

104
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,659
I'm getting tired.

105
00:06:29,659 --> 00:06:30,659
I'm getting bored.

106
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:33,919
I'm going to play with my balloon.

107
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,270
I gotta go.

108
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,919
Did you get it?
