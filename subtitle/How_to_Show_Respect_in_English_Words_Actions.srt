10
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:37,633
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish

11
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:41,583
and in this lesson, I'm going to show you how to show respect

12
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:45,776
in English because it's something that my students ask me often

13
00:00:45,776 --> 00:00:49,239
because they've realised that in English we don't have many

14
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,862
specific words or pronouns to show respect

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,810
like lots of other languages do so I'm going to go over

16
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,935
three main things in this lesson:

17
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:03,005
how to greet people in a respectful way,

18
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:07,210
especially people who are older than you or your boss or manager,

19
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,453
your lecturer,

20
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:12,609
people that you respect and you want to show respect to.

21
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:17,480
I'll also show you how we address people respectfully 

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,040
and how in English our actions are often more important

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,736
than words when we're communicating

24
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:27,365
and we're showing respect.

25
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:30,618

28
00:01:38,288 --> 00:01:41,100
if you enjoy this video, you know what to do.

29
00:01:46,694 --> 00:01:50,215
A little while back, I made a lesson about how to be polite

30
00:01:50,215 --> 00:01:52,830
and show respect in English.

31
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:56,559
It really focused on how to say no politely,

32
00:01:56,559 --> 00:02:00,445
how to make polite requests and suggestions

33
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:04,436
but it did get me thinking about showing respect

34
00:02:04,436 --> 00:02:09,440
in English because many other languages have really specific

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,606
pronouns or ways to address

36
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:14,328
older people or people who you respect.

37
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:18,129
My Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese students will all know

38
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:21,878
how important those pronouns are when addressing

39
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:24,892
family members or people who are older than you.

40
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:27,501
I mean it's built into your languages, isn't it?

41
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:31,797
So how do you do that? How do you show that same respect

42
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:34,594
when you're communicating in English?

43
00:02:36,377 --> 00:02:40,351
We don't have many pronouns that show respect in

44
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:45,170
general everyday language but you can show respect in other ways

45
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,775
and the most important way to show respect in English is by

46
00:02:48,775 --> 00:02:50,800
greeting someone properly.

47
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,101
It's going to set the tone for the whole conversation

48
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:57,920
and most people choose to greet with a really informal

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,426
hello, hi, hey.

50
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:04,209
Casual and friendly way to say hello right?

51
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:08,480
Perfectly acceptable greeting but if you deliberately want to show

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,181
respect to someone you can make your language

53
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,826
a little more formal.

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,214
You can say:

55
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:18,689
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening.

56
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,769
All of these expressions are really common, you know them,

57
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,942
but just by choosing these greetings you're instantly sounding

58
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,873
more polite and showing more respect

59
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:34,984
and if you're meeting someone that you respect for the first time,

60
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:38,583
you might also add: It's a pleasure to meet you.

61
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:41,280
Good afternoon, it's a pleasure to meet you.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,764
Just remember, you wouldn't actually say "good night"

63
00:03:45,764 --> 00:03:49,230
when you greet someone right because "good night" indicates

64
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,410
that you're leaving, it's a little more like goodbye.

65
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,512
All right let's talk about addressing someone with respect.

66
00:03:56,512 --> 00:04:00,365
I know in lots of the Asian cultures where I've lived there have been

67
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:04,498
specific pronouns used to show respect especially when you're

68
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:07,686
referring to someone who's older than you, you might say

69
00:04:07,686 --> 00:04:08,981
auntie or uncle.

70
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:12,565
How do you show respect in your language? Do you have

71
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,795
some similar pronouns like this? Something that you use

72
00:04:15,795 --> 00:04:18,173
to show respect to those who are older?

73
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,913
Let me know down in the comments, I'm really interested to hear

74
00:04:20,913 --> 00:04:21,440
from you.

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,002
Like I said in English we don't have many specific titles that

76
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:29,449
immediately show respect but there are some exceptions

77
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:34,280
made for certain professions. So we address doctors by saying

78
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,305
Dr. Jones with their surname.

79
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:40,020
Maybe for some professors, you might do the same

80
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,031
thing, Professor Saunders.

81
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:46,576
In a formal situation or definitely at school,

82
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:51,395
we would use a certain title followed by a person's name

83
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:53,184
so it would be Miss

84
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,738
Emma Jakobi or Miss Jakobi for a woman.

85
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,245
Mr Smith

86
00:04:59,494 --> 00:05:03,420
or Mrs Smith if it was a married woman.

87
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,486
Now some teachers and especially teachers at language schools

88
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:10,007
or even tutors at universities, 

89
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:14,051
they may just prefer you to call them by their first name

90
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,656
and if you're unsure about what to call them

91
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:19,395
you can politely ask them by saying:

92
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,357
How should I address you?

93
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:23,974
Should I call you Mr Turner?

94
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:27,349
That way, you'll find out exactly what they expect

95
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,326
and what they feel comfortable with.

96
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:33,460
Now what I do want to talk to you about are the titles that are not

97
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,559
often used and sometimes can seem so formal

98
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,672
that they make people feel a little uncomfortable

99
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:43,186
especially if they're used in the wrong context.

100
00:05:43,397 --> 00:05:46,806
Sir and madam or ma'am

101
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:50,211
are not very common in Australia or in the UK.

102
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,868
However, they may be heard a little more often in parts of the US

103
00:05:55,868 --> 00:05:58,044
especially in customer service

104
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,992
or with people who are involved in the military.

105
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:05,535
And I know that for some of you it might seem strange

106
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:09,824
or even a little rude to call your manager or your boss

107
00:06:09,824 --> 00:06:11,723
by their first name.

108
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:15,187
You might instinctively want to refer to your boss as

109
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:16,273
boss.

110
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,583
Good morning boss! Can I help you with that boss?

111
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:25,112
But to many English speakers, this would feel a little strange. 

112
00:06:25,112 --> 00:06:28,619
They may feel more comfortable if you just refer to them by their

113
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,598
first name.

114
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:32,902
Now the trick is when someone introduces themselves

115
00:06:32,902 --> 00:06:37,316
to you, you just need to listen to the name that they use.

116
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:41,065
They're telling you how to address them.

117
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,806
The most respectful thing that you can do

118
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:48,384
is to call them the name that they have offered to you

119
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:52,286
because if you choose to call them something else

120
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,841
because you think that's more respectful,

121
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,490
it's kind of showing disrespect by not calling them what they want

122
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,793
you to call them.

123
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,580
Excuse me goes a long, long way in English.

124
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,966
When you want to show someone respect, this phrase is essential.

125
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:14,479
It's always awkward to interrupt someone when they're speaking

126
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,058
or maybe when they're doing something else

127
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,825
especially when you're talking to your superior at work.

128
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:23,057
Sometimes it's got to be done

129
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:27,397
and the most respectful way to do this is to say:

130
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:31,834
Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt. Would you mind helping me...?

131
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:36,203
It's also a good way to ask someone to move out of the way.

132
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:39,259
Excuse me, would you mind if I get past? 

133
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,510
Oh sure.

134
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:46,113
It might seem simple but please and thank you are essential too.

135
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:49,497
English speakers know that as a child this was 

136
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:51,797
one of the first things that you were taught.

137
00:07:51,797 --> 00:07:54,333
When I was growing up my parents were adamant

138
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:58,560
that my brothers and I were always saying please and thank you

139
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,712
when we wanted something. We wouldn't get it

140
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:01,981
without those words.

141
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:07,092
In some languages, they're not as important as they are in English.

142
00:08:07,092 --> 00:08:10,845
Please and thank you are just so important in English

143
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:13,345
when you are trying to show respect.

144
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,829
When you make a really simple request,

145
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,811
if it's just pass the salt add please.

146
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:21,381
Please pass the salt.

147
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:23,673
Could you please pass me the salt?

148
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:26,224
Could you pass the salt, please?

149
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,215
And then of course, when you get the salt,

150
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,219
you'd say thank you.

151
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,775
And that person, if they're showing respect will also say

152
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,219
you're welcome.

153
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:40,258
These are all really common phrases that are essential

154
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,375
if you are trying to show respect to someone in English.

155
00:08:44,854 --> 00:08:48,770
Now if you remember at the beginning of this lesson I said that

156
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,896
for English speakers, the way that you show respect

157
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:56,654
is also based on your actions, not just words.

158
00:08:56,654 --> 00:08:59,096
So let's talk about some examples.

159
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:02,285
Be on time. Be punctual.

160
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:05,156
Do you know that word? Punctual.

161
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:09,278
So if you're punctual, it means that you're on time

162
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,461
and I know that for many different cultures it's not really a big deal

163
00:09:13,461 --> 00:09:16,655
if you're late but in most English-speaking countries,

164
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:20,798
people place a lot of emphasis on being on time.

165
00:09:20,798 --> 00:09:23,251
It's quite disrespectful to be late

166
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,938
and to keep someone waiting for you.

167
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:29,433
So maybe you're late to work, you're late for a class.

168
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:33,777
It's just not that acceptable so you want to try and be on time

169
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:36,262
and if you're not going to be on time

170
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,335
let them know, send a text, an email, make a call

171
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:42,649
and let them know that you're going to be running late.

172
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,027
Five or ten minutes might be ok but anything longer than that

173
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:50,624
and you're showing disrespect.

174
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:54,951
Another important and respectful action that people in

175
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:57,638
English-speaking countries really value

176
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,119
is listening.

177
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:03,619
So if someone is talking and you start checking your phone or

178
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:07,180
doodling on your notepad or talking to a friend,

179
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,653
that is being disrespectful and so in this situation

180
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,425
it's your actions that is speaking much, much louder than words.

181
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:18,453
Don't push in.

182
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,303
Waiting patiently for your turn is a hallmark of respect

183
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:28,016
in English-speaking cultures. If you push in, you're sending a

184
00:10:28,016 --> 00:10:30,958
big loud message to everyone else who's waiting that you don't

185
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,618
care about them or how long they've been waiting.

186
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:37,773
Now I know that in some cultures it's completely acceptable

187
00:10:37,773 --> 00:10:42,258
for older people or certain people to move to the front of a line

188
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:46,164
and to kind of jostle in front of someone but this is extremely

189
00:10:46,164 --> 00:10:48,680
disrespectful in western cultures.

190
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,832
and in English-speaking countries

191
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,952
It is seen as very polite and very respectful to offer your place

192
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:57,363
to someone who needs it

193
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,556
but not to push in because you're older or because you need it.

194
00:11:02,556 --> 00:11:05,087
You would always ask politely.

195
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,756
Usually, I have a little challenge at the end for you 

196
00:11:08,756 --> 00:11:12,728
but for this lesson, I'd like you to share what is respectful

197
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:15,476
and disrespectful in your culture.

198
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:18,400
So down in the comments, can you tell me

199
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,042
how you show respect in your native language or culture?

200
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,948
Do you greet or address people differently

201
00:11:25,948 --> 00:11:28,211
because of their age or their status?

202
00:11:28,364 --> 00:11:32,554
And what actions are seen as disrespectful?

203
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,170
I think it's fascinating that we all have different ways of showing

204
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,697
respect in our different cultures through language or through our

205
00:11:40,697 --> 00:11:45,414
actions but it is really important to understand and to learn

206
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:49,726
how to show respect in different cultures and of course,

207
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:52,939
make sure we're not being disrespectful.

208
00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:56,309
So I hope this video has given you some new ideas about how you

209
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:58,602
can show more respect in English,

210
00:11:58,602 --> 00:12:03,782
I've given you some great tools to use to greet people respectfully,

211
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,549
to address people respectfully or in the right way

212
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:12,681
and showing respect through your actions,

213
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,557
the things that you do.

214
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,065
So you know what to do now, you want to take these tools

215
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:21,312
and go out and test them out in the real world.

216
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:24,281
And if you haven't checked out these lessons here yet

217
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,357
I think you should, you'll love them.

218
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:29,920
Have an amazing week and I will see you next time!
