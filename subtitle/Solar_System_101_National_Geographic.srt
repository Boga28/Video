1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,040
- [Narrator] Our solar system is one

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,460
of over 500 known solar systems

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,493
in the entire Milky Way galaxy.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,810
The solar system came into being

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,290
about 4.5 billion years ago, when a cloud

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,940
of interstellar gas and dust collapsed,

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,940
resulting in a solar
nebula, a swirling disc

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,233
of material that collided
to form the solar system.

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,540
The solar system is located

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,410
in the Milky Way's Orion star cluster.

11
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,970
Only 15% of stars in the
galaxy host planetary systems,

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,763
and one of those stars is our own sun.

13
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,420
Revolving around the
sun are eight planets.

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,850
The planets are divided
into two categories,

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,420
based on their composition,

16
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,610
Terrestrial and Jovian.

17
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,700
Terrestrial planets including
Mercury, Venus, Earth,

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,170
and Mars, are primarily
made of rocky material.

19
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,310
Their surfaces are solid,
they don't have ring systems,

20
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,670
they have very few or no moons,

21
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,543
and they are relatively small.

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,520
The smallest and closest
to the sun is Mercury,

23
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,870
which has the shortest
orbit in the solar system

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,623
at about three Earth months.

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,180
Venus is the hottest
planet, with temperatures

26
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,500
of up to 867 degrees
Fahrenheit, due to an atmosphere

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,970
of carbon dioxide and
extensive lava flows.

28
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,200
Next to this world of fire
is a world of water, Earth.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,450
The water systems on
this planet help create

30
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,560
the only known environment in the universe

31
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,383
capable of sustaining life.

32
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,870
The last of the terrestrial planets, Mars,

33
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:43,430
might have also supported life
about 3.7 billion years ago,

34
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,893
when the planet had a watery
surface, and moist atmosphere.

35
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,470
Beyond the four Terrestrial planets

36
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,260
of the inner solar system
lie the Jovian planets

37
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,140
of the outer solar system.

38
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,890
The Jovian planets include
gas giants Jupiter and Saturn

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,800
and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,290
The gas giants are
predominantly made of helium

41
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,360
and hydrogen, and the ice
giants also contain rock, ice,

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,100
and a liquid mixture of
water, methane, and ammonia.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,980
All four Jovian planets
have multiple moons,

44
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,313
sport ring systems, have no
solid surface, and are immense.

45
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,300
The largest Jovian is
also the largest planet

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,393
in the solar system, Jupiter.

47
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,443
Nearby is Saturn, the solar
system's second largest planet.

48
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,160
Its signature rings are wide enough

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,580
to fit between Earth and the moon,

50
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,493
but are barely a kilometer thick.

51
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,530
Past Saturn are the ice
giants, Uranus and Neptune.

52
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,260
The slightly bigger of
these ice giants, Uranus,

53
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,443
is famous for rotating on its side.

54
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,700
Next to Uranus is Neptune,
the outermost planet

55
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,240
in the solar system, and
also one of the coldest.

56
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,400
Orbiting the Terrestrial
planets is the asteroid belt,

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,170
a flat disc of rocky
objects, full of remnants

58
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,120
from the solar system's formation.

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,260
From microscopic dust particles,

60
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,023
to the largest known object,
the dwarf planet, Ceres.

61
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,510
Another disc of space debris
lies much further out,

62
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,193
and orbits the Jovian
planets, the icy Kuiper Belt.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,040
Apart from asteroids, the
Kuiper Belt is also home

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,840
to dwarf planets, such as Pluto,

65
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,710
and is the birthplace of many comets.

66
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,410
Beyond the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud,

67
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,630
a vast, spherical
collection of icy debris.

68
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,280
It is considered the
edge of the solar system

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,180
since that is where the gravitational

70
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:40,663
and physical influences of the sun end.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,240
Our solar system's
particular configuration

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,880
of planets and other celestial objects,

73
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,240
all revolving around a life-giving star,

74
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,833
make it a special place to call home.
