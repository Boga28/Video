00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,080
Have you ever wondered why you can read English, 
you can even listen to English, but you cannot  

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,720
speak English fluently? Paula an English learner 
that watches our videos left us this comment on  

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:31,760
one of our lessons. We understand that if this 
is your case you're frustrated. After all, who  

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,560
wants to learn English if not to speak it. Here at 
RealLife English we’ve helped thousands of English  

5
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,520
learners just like you overcome their fears and 
limitations, connect to their deep desire of why  

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,640
they’re learning English, and transform themselves 
by becoming confident, fluent English speakers who  

7
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,800
can connect with anyone in the world. Each of 
these people’s stories are different, but we  

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,160
recognized some patterns. I’d even go so far as 
to name the villains in their story! These are:  

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:14,640
shyness ,forgetting words, lack of opportunity. 
In this lesson, we'll uncover the truth behind why  

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,520
you can understand more than what you can actually 
speak in English. Also, I’ll give you 7 tips on  

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,120
what you need to do in order to overcome shyness, 
leave the problem of forgetting words behind,  

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,400
and find opportunities to speak English.
Before we get into the lesson,  

13
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,480
here at RealLife English we would be honoured to 
accompany you on your journey to English fluency.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,720
With that said, let’s get right into it: why 
can't I speak English as well as i can listen?

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,760
The main reason why that happens is because 
of what is technically referred to as memory  

20
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,520
recognition and recall. Turns out, recognizing 
is much easier than recalling. Broadly speaking,  

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
this means that when you listen to English, you’re 
basically recognizing the words that you hear.  

22
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,720
When you speak, on the other hand, you need to 
recall or remember words in order to produce  

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,120
a message. This takes more effort to do.
Imagine this. You’re in your car driving  

24
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,880
to work, to the gym, or to any place that you 
regularly go to. When you look out the window,  

25
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,120
you can recognize where you are. You’ve seen 
that building many times, and that house,  

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,040
and that square. You see, recognizing 
takes very little cognitive effort. 

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,720
On the other hand, recalling is 
much more heavy duty or intense.  

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,200
If I asked you to think about each house in the 
right order_ that you pass by on your way to work,  

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,240
you can probably very easily think about 
the house that’s right next door to yours,  

30
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,160
and the next one. But as you try to recall the 
houses that are further and further away from  

31
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:34,640
your house, it becomes more and more fuzzy. 
Recalling requires tons of mental effort! 

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,200
This is what speaking is. It’s a very dynamic 
activity that requires you to integrate everything  

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,040
that you know about English: vocabulary, 
grammar and pronunciation to produce sounds.

34
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,840
Listening is a passive skill, while speaking 
is active. To go further, we can classify  

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,680
the four basic English skills into 2 groups. 
Listening and reading are receptive skills,  

36
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,680
while speaking and writing are productive skills.
What all of this means is that your receptive  

37
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,440
skills are always going to be more developed than 
your productive skills. In fact, it doesn’t make  

38
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,240
sense for it to be the other way around.
Having said that, the frustration that so  

39
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,200
many of you have still isn’t any less of 
an issue when you know all that, right?

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,760
You still feel that you can’t 
speak as fluently as you’d like;  

41
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,120
you still freeze and get scared when 
speaking. Many of you don’t even have  

42
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,360
opportunities to practice speaking. 
These three villains have gone nowhere! 

43
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,320
Later, I’m going to give you specific tips 
on how you can overcome those problems.  

44
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,240
However, the root of the issue, is probably that 
you’re not getting enough practice speaking.

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,760
A scholar recently argued 
that in the language classroom  

46
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,480
there should be more focus on 
speaking practice, she said:

47
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,120
“It’s not surprising that practicing 
talking can make you better at talking.” 

48
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,680
Let’s take a look at the three 
essential activities that you need  

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,720
to master the English language or any language.

50
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,000
The first one is exposure. This is a 
non-negotiable, as we like to say, so you _HAVE_  

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,320
to get it. The more exposure to the language you 
get, the better off you’ll be. In today's world,  

52
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,000
this is really easy to get. You get exposed to 
English by reading, watching Netflix, playing  

53
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,240
video games in English, by listening to music 
and podcasts. There’s never too much exposure.

54
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,200
Stephen Krashen is famous for his input 
hypothesis, in which he states that you  

55
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:45,360
acquire language through exposure and that you 
learn by studying. And he says that acquiring  

56
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,160
is better than learning. Acquisition is great! 
But I also do think that you need to set aside  

57
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,920
some time to learn, if you want to make some 
serious progress in your English. That’s the  

58
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:05,040
next essential activity. Focused learning. This 
is when you deliberately learn some aspect of the  

59
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:11,200
language, whether this is something about grammar, 
meanings of words, or how to pronounce words.  

60
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,560
In order to learn a language well, you need to 
dedicate some time to learning it conscientiously.  

61
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,040
In my opinion, at a beginner 
and early intermediate level,  

62
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,240
as little as 2 hours per week is going to be 
enough to move you forward in your learning.  

63
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,680
But the more time you can dedicate to your 
learning, the better off you’ll be, of course. 

64
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,200
Finally, you need practice to help you 
really learn and make w hat you learned  

65
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,480
deliberately yours, or even what you acquired 
by being exposed to the language. This is why we  

66
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,360
always say use or lose it. If you don’t put into 
practice what you’ve learned, you will forget it.

67
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,320
Now, how this looks in the span of 
a week might be something like this:  

68
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:03,520
As we said, you could do focused learning 2 hours 
per week. Maybe up to 5 depending on how much time  

69
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,160
you have. As for exposure it’s hard to quantify, 
maybe you read here and there, listen to some  

70
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:16,560
English at different moments in your day, etc. It 
can very easily amount to several hours per week.  

71
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,400
So, let’s say that that’s 20 hours per week. 
Then, what you really don’t want to neglect is  

72
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,640
the practice part. You never want this to be less 
than the time that you spend on focused learning.  

73
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,960
When I say practice, I mean the productive skills 
of writing and speaking that we saw earlier.  

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,360
Ideally, practice should be at least 3 times as 
much as focused learning. As I said, that’s how  

75
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:51,120
you solidify what you learn or even acquire.
Now, you can look at that in terms of those 3  

76
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,240
activities. But you can also simplify it quite 
a bit and come to the realization that when  

77
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,360
you welcome English as a part of your life, 
rather than accept it as something that you  

78
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,600
have to study, you will always be getting the 
exposure, learning and practice that you need.

79
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,520
We always say don’t just learn English, live it.
And that’s exactly what we want for you:  

80
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,280
to have the opportunity to live your English. 
That is why we have created a tool that will  

81
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,240
be incredibly valuable for you if you 
want to become a fluent English speaker.  

82
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,840
We’ve recently launched the RealLife English 
Podcast and Speaking App, which will give  

83
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,280
dedicated learners, just like you, the 
opportunity to speak English with other  

84
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,720
learners from around the world, at 
the touch of a button, for free.

85
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Download this app now, and don’t miss 
the opportunity to take advantage of  

86
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,320
this amazing way to connect with people from 
all over the world and practice your English! 

87
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,360
If one of the reasons why you can’t speak 
English as fluently as you want is because  

88
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,120
you don’t have opportunities to practice it, 
I hope our app will solve that problem. Now,  

89
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
how do we solve the shyness 
problem? Or forgetting words?  

90
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,600
Maybe you can relate to what this other 
subscriber commented on one of our videos:

91
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,160
So, I’ll give you 7 tips that combine 
learning and practice that will help you be  

92
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,640
more confident in your speaking.

93
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,320
Imitate away
The thing is we’re naturally inclined  

94
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,640
to copy what other people do. As this article 
puts it imitation is at the heart of being human.  

95
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,880
When we imitate others, we’re learning 
from them, copying what works for them.  

96
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,160
It activates the watch and 
learn part of our brain.

97
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,440
What this looks like for you as an English 
learner is using a model English speaker.  

98
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
It could be a more experienced English 
learner or a native English speaker.  

99
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
Imitate what they say, and how they say it.

100
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,400
The idea is that you explore, play, listen 
and repeat. Activate your curiosity for sounds  

101
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:13,680
and words. If there’s a particular word you 
imitate but that you don’t know the meaning of,  

102
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,680
go ahead and look it up. This over time 
builds up and that’s how you make progress. 

103
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,080
Learn chunks
We covered this in detail  

104
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:30,160
in a video we titled: The #1 Key to Advanced 
Fluency: Word Chunks. You can watch it here.

105
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,760
But to give you a summary, word chunks  

106
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,960
are a sequence of words that come naturally 
together to express an idea. For example,  

107
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,920
when you first learned "Nice to meet you", 
you didn't study each word in that sentence.  

108
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,960
You simply learned them all together, and even 
the answer, "Nice to meet you, too!", right?

109
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,480
Well, don’t just stop there 
and continue prioritizing  

110
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,720
learning chunks over learning single words. 
Chunk learning is extremely valuable because. 

111
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,000
It helps with fluency. Various research studies 
have found that more fluent speakers are able  

112
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,280
to speak faster and with less hesitation 
due to the effective use of chunks. 

113
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,920
It helps idiomaticity. The use of chunks 
can help students appear as idiomatic  

114
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,440
language users - by that we mean they can 
use expressions that are natural and correct. 

115
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,520
It sets you up for further learning. For example, 
when you learn a word chunk with the word way,  

116
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,640
you’re more likely to learn other chunks, by 
just changing a word. For example, “on the way”  

117
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,880
means something is coming (ex: 
"there's more snow on the way")  

118
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,880
Now, you can replace “on” with “by” and you 
get “by the way.” Then there’s more chunks  

119
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:49,200
you can play with: when you say I’m on my 
way, or no way of… as in no way of knowing,  

120
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,160
no way of telling, etc. One chunk can help you 
get the foundation for subsequent learning. 

121
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,960
Be proactive
By this I mean put what  

122
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:05,360
you’ve learned into use immediately. If there is 
one thing your brain enjoys, it is feeling useful.  

123
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,280
Our brains dislike storing information that 
we don’t use. (Maybe that’s why you keep  

124
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,360
forgetting the English words you tried learning 
yesterday!). As we always say, use or lose it.  

125
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,200
You can come up with sentences where you can 
use a new word or chunk that you’ve learned.  

126
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:30,000
If English is already integrated as a part of your 
life, you’ll find the opportunity to use that new  

127
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,200
learned word soon enough.
Be an actor! 

128
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,440
Think about what an actor does. They read a text, 
memorize it, then internalize it and then they  

129
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,600
repeat it. They use emotion, exaggeration, 
repetition and practice. These are awesome  

130
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,840
things you can integrate in your English practice. 
You’re probably used to sounding a certain way in  

131
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:58,240
your native language, but don’t be afraid to 
add new layers to your voice. If you’re shy,  

132
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,600
this will definitely help you to embrace a new 
way of speaking that pushes through that shyness. 

133
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,880
Get feedback (from others too!)
That’s right. Your feedback or the self-monitoring  

134
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,520
over your speech is essential. Hear yourself. 
Listen to how English sounds when you speak it.  

135
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,240
Notice when you get stuck in a certain idea and 
don’t know how to express it correctly. Or when  

136
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,560
you realize you don’t have the words you need to 
say something. Then, be proactive and Google them!

137
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Talking alone and recording yourself can be a 
great way to give yourself feedback. When you  

138
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:42,800
do this, you’ll notice that the first thing you’d 
be inclined to talk about is your own life. So,  

139
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,000
go for it. A student of mine told me he’s been 
narrating his life or how his day went for years,  

140
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,840
and that he finds it interesting to 
listen back to old recordings as it  

141
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,480
feels like a trip back in time and he can 
notice how much his English has improved.

142
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,960
Then, there are two other types of feedback 
that you can get. You can get direct feedback  

143
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,640
from a more experienced learner, a native 
English speaker or even a peer, someone who’s  

144
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:16,000
in a similar stage in their learning. Ask them 
about what they think about their honest opinion  

145
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,120
on how you’re speaking. Sometimes you might need 
to hire a teacher to give you more qualified  

146
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,360
advice and also to actually give you feedback. 
If you rely too much on a friend, this person  

147
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,040
might feel uncomfortable pointing 
out what you need to improve.

148
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,800
The other type of feedback that you can get 
is indirect feedback. This requires you to  

149
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,720
be willing to speak English with others. The way 
this works is that you have to pick up the signals  

150
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,320
other people give you when you’re speaking. When 
you try to say something, does the other person  

151
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,560
understand you without any effort? If the answer 
is yes, great. You can be fully confident you can  

152
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,560
file that sentence away as correct. But, if the 
other person is unsure what you mean, use it as a  

153
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,240
sign that you could reflect on whatever you said, 
how you said it, and how you could say it better.

154
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,320
My last tip is:
Or as Ethan would say: Do what you gotta do 

155
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,400
This is a bit like the “be proactive” 
tip I just gave you. However,  

156
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,880
it’s more about the realization that you 
have to take responsibility over your own  

157
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,040
learning. A teacher can help. I can help to 
guide you in certain aspects. But you’re the hero  

158
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,640
of your own adventure, and you have to figure 
it out. You absolutely can if you want it.

159
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,920
If you’re too shy to speak, make a plan 
to gradually put yourself in more and more  

160
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,760
challenging situations until you can feel much 
better about yourself and about your English.  

161
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:51,040
You might not stop being shy completely, 
but at least you will have made  

162
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,800
enough progress to keep that shyness from 
making you pass on valuable opportunities.

163
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,280
If you forget words. It might be because you’re 
not putting your English into use. If you don’t  

164
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,200
have an opportunity to practice your English… 
Well, once again I will tell you, you can download  

165
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:15,200
our new app, where you can instantly get connected 
to another English learner just like yourself.

166
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,040
That’s it for this lesson! I hope you find 
it useful! Remember, it all becomes a lot  

167
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,280
easier when you make English a part 
of your life, because at that point,  

168
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,720
you don’t just learn it, you live it and when 
you live it fluency will come on its own.
