00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:10,360
Hi there, it's Ronnie, going to teach
you a lesson about using the past tense.

2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,805
A lot of people struggle
with the past tense

3
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:20,260
because there's so many
verbs, there's irregular

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:28,720
verbs, there's regular verbs, "ed" verbs,
and a lot of the times when we're focused

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,390
too much on the
conjugation of verbs, we kind

6
00:00:32,402 --> 00:00:35,920
of forget to use other
ways to actually use

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,879
the past in regular
conversations, which is

8
00:00:38,891 --> 00:00:42,000
my goal with you, to
help you speak naturally

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,380
so you don't sound like a person
that doesn't speak English very well.

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,080
I want you to sound as natural as you can,
and this is a really interesting thing that

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,020
I've been thinking about for a while is how
we use the past tense in kind of a strange

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,340
way.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,440
So, this is a grammar-based lesson on using
the past, but there's some cool connections

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:06,700
here.

15
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,020
Let's look at our
sentences, first of all.

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,380
The blue sentences are
written in present tense.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,580
I would say, "He
is such an asshole."

18
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,480
Because our verb is "is",
we know this is present tense.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,964
And "such an asshole"
means they're not

20
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:31,920
really cool, not a really
good person, okay?

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,180
But if we wanted to make it past, we
would say, "He was such an asshole."

22
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,980
So, again, simple past,
we're changing "is" to "was".

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,002
And, hopefully, through
this, when I'm giving

24
00:01:49,014 --> 00:01:51,640
you these examples,
you're thinking, "Wow,

25
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,000
why would I say 'He
was such an asshole'?"

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,460
Okay?

27
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,200
Let's look at number two.

28
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:05,520
We always go to the park
and make fun of rollerbladers.

29
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,580
Do you know what this means
to make fun of someone?

30
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,160
Ha-ha.

31
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:19,329
If you make fun of
someone, it means that

32
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:24,260
you take delight or joy
in weird things about

33
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:24,660
people.

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,480
So...

35
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,400
Or bad things.

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,670
Let's say that someone's
wearing some weird

37
00:02:30,682 --> 00:02:35,340
clothes, or someone
falls someplace, or they're

38
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,771
doing something that
you think is weird, you

39
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,060
would make fun of
them, like, "Oh, that's

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,320
weird.

41
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:40,940
Ha-ha.

42
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,900
That's weird you do that."

43
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,740
This is how bullying starts.

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,560
So, you can make fun of
rollerbladers, that's fine.

45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,420
We always go to the park
and make fun of rollerbladers.

46
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,880
This sentence is in simple present, because
we have "always" and we have the verb "go".

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,619
If I wanted to make
that past, I would say,

48
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:09,960
"We would always go
to the park and make fun

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,040
of rollerbladers."

50
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,398
This past tense of
the verb "will", "would",

51
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,700
the auxiliary verb, is
indicating to me that

52
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:25,740
it's something that we did in
the past as kind of a hobby.

53
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,120
It's my hobby to do that.

54
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,740
We can talk about people's jobs.

55
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,240
I can say, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I know, I know, Kelly.

56
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,040
She is an undertaker."

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,860
So, when we talk about people's occupations
or their jobs, we use the verb "to be", and

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,400
again in the past, "Oh, yeah,
yeah, she was an undertaker."

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,920
So, why would we use the past
tense to speak about people like this?

60
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,000
What's happening?

61
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,500
There are two reasons.

62
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:07,360
One of them is maybe the person
has died, or the person's dead to you.

63
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,491
Maybe the person you're
speaking to is talking

64
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:15,660
about an ex-boyfriend
or an ex-girlfriend

65
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,900
or an ex-friend.

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,046
So, if I'm having a
conversation with someone

67
00:04:23,058 --> 00:04:26,300
and they said, "Oh my
god, Kevin was such

68
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:33,600
an asshole", hmm, this has two things
that are going to happen in my brain.

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:42,020
Either Kevin's dead, or we no longer talk
to Kevin, and he's still an asshole, maybe,

70
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,660
but the relationship with
the speaker has changed.

71
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,400
Let's look at this example.

72
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,020
"Oh, we would always go to the
park and make fun of rollerbladers."

73
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,046
We're reminiscing or
thinking about things in

74
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:58,960
the past that we would
do with this person.

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,040
Maybe this is a good thing
about a past relationship.

76
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,180
"Oh, my ex and I, you know, we broke up, we
would always go to the park, it was great."

77
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,576
So, when people are
using the past tense to

78
00:05:11,588 --> 00:05:14,220
speak about someone,
those are the two reasons.

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,980
"She was an undertaker."

80
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,543
Now, she could be
retired, or she could be

81
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:23,300
dead, or, you know,
your ex-girlfriend could

82
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,200
have been into that stuff
and been an undertaker.

83
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,884
Another thing that we
use in English to talk

84
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:35,320
about habits, like "would",
is we use "used to".

85
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,400
"Oh, you know what?

86
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:40,900
You know, we used
to go to the cemetery."

87
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,997
So, I'm talking about
things that we did habitually,

88
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:49,760
things that we did
together on a regular basis.

89
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,700
And in English, again, I
use the simple present.

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,920
We go to the graveyard.

91
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,740
This tells me...

92
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,660
And by the way, "graveyard"
and "cemetery", not very different.

93
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,780
Oh, hey, Trevor.

94
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,120
What are you doing there, buddy?

95
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,100
He's the keeper of the
graveyard and the cemetery.

96
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,380
We go to the graveyard,
something you do on a regular basis.

97
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,140
Every Tuesday, we go to
the cemetery and we run.

98
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,860
Or every Friday, we go to the
graveyard and we check out the birds.

99
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,180
We go birdwatching in the
cemetery, see some crows.

100
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,721
But if people are using
the past tense, you're

101
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,100
going to have to be
careful, especially if

102
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,900
the person's dead.

103
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,060
It's very important to
read your audience.

104
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,340
If someone's like, "Oh, okay,
um, tell me about your family.

105
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,060
Okay, tell me about your dad.

106
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,800
Uh, yeah, he was really cool."

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,900
Uh-oh, he was cool.

108
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,600
What happened to him?

109
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,620
Is he not cool anymore?

110
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:52,460
No.

111
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,080
He's probably dead.

112
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,640
So be very careful with this.

113
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,418
You don't want to trigger
someone or make them

114
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,080
feel depressed or sad
about what's happened.

115
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,724
We also have some
very interesting vocabulary

116
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:10,260
that could be confusing
if you didn't know

117
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,500
how to talk about
dead people, not exes.

118
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,760
"Exes", by the way, means
past boyfriends or girlfriends.

119
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,160
We just say "exes".

120
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,080
It's my ex.

121
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:31,520
You could say "someone passed away"
or "someone passed", and you think...

122
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,120
Did they pass a test?

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,500
Did they pass you on the street?

124
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:35,700
No.

125
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,640
This means that they're dead.

126
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,760
So these are some different
phrases that people use.

127
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,700
It's kind of rude to say,
"Oh yeah, he's dead."

128
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,320
Like, whoa.

129
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,180
Okay?

130
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,260
So, people try and
use more polite phrases.

131
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,440
You might hear someone say,
"Oh yeah, we lost him last year."

132
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,200
You lost him?

133
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,160
Well, did you find him?

134
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,140
Where did he go?

135
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,480
Is he okay?

136
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,040
If someone says, "We lost someone",
again, that means that the person's dead.

137
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,800
More formally, "She's
no longer with us."

138
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,500
And then you think,
well, where is she?

139
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Is she with someone else?

140
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,160
No.

141
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,940
If someone's no longer with
us, again, it means they're dead.

142
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,900
We have some slang.

143
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,122
It's okay to joke with
your friends, but make

144
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:31,440
sure your friends aren't
going through a death

145
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,159
when you're doing this.

146
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,240
First word is
"croaked", like a frog.

147
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,360
I don't know why.

148
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,220
Frogs croak.

149
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,560
It's the sound that
frogs make, by the way.

150
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:46,420
So, "Oh yeah, the old
man croaked yesterday."

151
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,520
He's a frog?

152
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:47,900
No.

153
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,200
Just means he died.

154
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,380
Here's a really common one.

155
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,380
"He kicked the bucket."

156
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,420
Oh.

157
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,960
Well, I don't know why
that represents death.

158
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,260
I've got some homework, or
you've got some homework.

159
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,627
In the comments, look
these expressions up

160
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,780
and tell me why in
English we say "he kicked

161
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,380
the bucket", because he's dead.

162
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:07,900
Right?

163
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,020
So, if he's dead, you can't
kick a bucket, figure this out.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,840
And there's one,
"He dropped dead."

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,638
This has the suggestion
that the person died

166
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,460
suddenly, like, oh
yeah, he was just jogging

167
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,280
and he dropped dead.

168
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,892
It's really strange the
amount of people who

169
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:29,000
are really fit, really
healthy, and they're

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,040
jogging and they die.

171
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,640
Yeah, don't jog.

172
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,720
Run fast or walk, but just don't
jog, because you might pass out.

173
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,780
And that's another thing.

174
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,820
"Pass out", be careful,
and "pass away".

175
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,500
You don't say, "Oh yeah, my
grandmother passed out last night."

176
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,145
"Pass out" means you
lose consciousness,

177
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:54,180
but "passed away"
means that you died, so...

178
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,609
I know English is
difficult, I know we've

179
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:59,300
got these phrasal
verbs, but one thing that's

180
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,815
really important when
you're speaking to people,

181
00:10:02,827 --> 00:10:06,060
pay attention and try
and use the past tense

182
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:13,520
naturally using expressions like "he was",
"we would always do this", "we used to" to

183
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,901
talk about habits, and
make sure that when

184
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:18,420
you're listening to
people, if they're using

185
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:21,764
the person in the past
tense, that you focus

186
00:10:21,776 --> 00:10:24,980
on why they're doing
this, like, oh, okay,

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,084
I remember Ronnie's
lesson, it's either an

188
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:31,340
ex or a dead person,
so be careful, but have

189
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:31,680
fun.

190
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,415
And for your homework,
check out these expressions,

191
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,880
and don't forget to visit
your local graveyard.

192
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,938
I'll be there, too, with
Trevor, yeah, we'll

193
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,540
be hanging out, you
know, taking autographs

194
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,060
and stuff, and maybe you can give me
some popsicles when you're there, but...

195
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,100
Or money, you know.

196
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm Ronnie, and I hope that
all your days are wonderful.

197
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,540
Yeah.
