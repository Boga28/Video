1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
In this English lesson,

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,610
I wanted to help you learn

3
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,570
the English phrase, "Out of my control."

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,110
There are things on this farm

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,620
that are under my control.

6
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,130
There are things that I am in control of,

7
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,320
but there are also things

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,150
that are out of my control.

9
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,960
Things like how often it rains,

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,260
that's out of my control.

11
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,970
Sometimes we get too much rain.

12
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,640
Sometimes we don't get enough rain,

13
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,620
but I can't make it rain.

14
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,453
Okay?

15
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:24,502
It is out of my control.

16
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:27,440
I wish sometimes that it was though.

17
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,150
I wish sometimes we could just

18
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,060
go on the internet and order rain.

19
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,054
Like, "We would like one
inch of rain tomorrow,

20
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:35,980
preferably in the afternoon."

21
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:36,813
But we can't

22
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:39,650
because the rain is out of my control.

23
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,240
This morning it's Saturday,

24
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,520
today that I'm making this lesson early.

25
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,990
This morning I did a live lesson,

26
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,090
and the wind was out of my control.

27
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,030
It was quite windy,

28
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,950
but I think people could
hear things just fine.

29
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,867
The second phrase I wanted to teach you is

30
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:54,700
"To be in control."

31
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,950
A lot of people want to be a leader.

32
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,900
They want to be in charge of something.

33
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,970
They want to be in control.

34
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,610
We have this even in my own family.

35
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,060
Sometimes when we organize an event,

36
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,093
a few of us really like to be in control,

37
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,312
even if it's something like a small party

38
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:14,780
for my mum or a family gathering.

39
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,250
Sometimes my brothers and sisters,

40
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,320
and I argue a little bit

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,760
because all of us like to be in control.

42
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,691
We like to be the person in charge.

43
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,500
We like to be the person
doing the planning,

44
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,550
and buying everything,

45
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,620
which is kind of silly.

46
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,460
It's actually far easier

47
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,180
to not be in control of a situation.

48
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,960
It's far easier to let
someone else be in control.

49
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,820
But hey.

50
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,430
that's the way it goes sometimes.

51
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,690
So to review.

52
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,960
When something is out of my control,

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,410
it means that I cannot make it happen.

54
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,243
Okay?

55
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:45,520
If I'm driving on the highway,

56
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,700
and traffic is slow,

57
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,770
it's out of my control.

58
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,770
I can't make people in
front of me go faster.

59
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,150
And to be in control

60
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,950
is the same as to be in charge,

61
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:57,010
to be the person who is responsible

62
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,840
for something that is happening.

63
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,673
But hey.

64
00:01:59,673 --> 00:02:01,760
Let's look at a comment
from a previous video.

65
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,120
This comment is from

66
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,820
voiretvisite

67
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,653
and the comment is this.

68
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:07,190
"Hello, your grass is nice

69
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,883
with a wonderful green color.

70
00:02:09,956 --> 00:02:12,170
You really know how to take care of it.

71
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,500
The weather seems fine for mid September,

72
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,970
have a nice day."

73
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,017
And my response,

74
00:02:17,017 --> 00:02:19,570
"The only thing we do to
make our grass look good

75
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,220
is that we don't cut it too short.

76
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,950
Cutting grass too short makes it unhappy.

77
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,609
Rain helps, but that's
outside of my control.

78
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:29,730
Notice I use the phrase there

79
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,050
that I just taught you.

80
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:31,883
But yes.

81
00:02:31,883 --> 00:02:33,530
Let's have a look at the grass.

82
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,640
Let me hold this as high as I can.

83
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,121
Our grass right now is
very nice and very green.

84
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:41,650
We have been very happy here on the farm.

85
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,921
It was dry for a while,

86
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:45,060
and then it started raining again.

87
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,650
But we don't fertilize our grass.

88
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,690
We don't do anything special to our grass.

89
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,300
We don't water our grass.

90
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,640
The only thing we do is we make sure

91
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,930
that when we mow the lawn,

92
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,960
let me spin you around.

93
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,180
We make sure that when we mow the lawn,

94
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,201
the setting on the lawnmower

95
00:03:06,201 --> 00:03:09,620
is as high as possible.

96
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,070
And this is one of the secrets

97
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,890
to having a very nice green lawn.

98
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,270
Many people don't actually realize this.

99
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,786
Many people cut their lawn super short,

100
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:24,115
and that's actually a bad idea.

101
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:27,207
It looks nicer when it's super short,

102
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,850
but it's not actually
healthy for the plant.

103
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,683
Sorry.

104
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:32,040
It's a little windy out here still.

105
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,270
Hopefully the microphone

106
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,000
isn't making all kinds
of weird noises on you.

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,620
I'll probably just wrap this video up

108
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,210
as it gets super windy.

109
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,650
Maybe my hat will blow away.

110
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,483
Anyways.

111
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:42,316
Thanks for watching.

112
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:43,149
I'm Bob the Canadian.

113
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:45,260
I hope you enjoyed this
little short English lesson,

114
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,160
and I'll see you in a couple
of days with another one.

115
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,993
Bye.
