1
00:00:17,735 --> 00:00:21,200
What would I do without your smart mouth?

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,700
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out.

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,600
You got my head spinning, no kidding.

4
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,000
I can't pin you down.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,800
What's going on in that beautiful mind?

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,240
I'm on your magical, mystery ride.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,200
And I'm so dizzy,

8
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,200
Don't know what hit me,

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,800
But I'll be alright.

10
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:56,400
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine.

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:02,000
You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind.

12
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:09,000
'Cause all of me, loves all of you.

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,020
Love your curves and all your edges,

14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,700
All your perfect imperfections.

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,200
Give your all to me,

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,765
I give my all to you.

17
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,300
You're my end and my beginning,

18
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,800
Even when I lose I'm winning.

19
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Cause I give you all of me,

20
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,400
And you give me all of you.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
(Oh)

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,400
How many times do I have to tell you -

23
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,700
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too.

24
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:04,000
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every move.

25
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,540
You're my downfall,  you're my muse.

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,400
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues.

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:20,000
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you.

28
00:02:20,425 --> 00:02:27,400
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,200
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind.

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,500
'Cause all of me, loves all of you -

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Love your curves and all your edges,

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,100
All your perfect imperfections.

33
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:55,500
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you.

34
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,700
You're my end and my beginning,

35
00:02:59,735 --> 00:03:03,300
Even when I lose I'm winning.

36
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:10,800
'Cause I give you all of me,

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,300
And you give me all of you.

38
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:17,800
(Oh)

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,100
You give me all of you. (Oh)

40
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:28,600
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts.

41
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Risking it all, though it's hard.

42
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,500
'Cause all of me, loves all of you.

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Love your curves and all your edges,

44
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,925
All your perfect imperfections.

45
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:56,800
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you.

46
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,600
You're my end and my beginning,

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,400
Even when I lose, I'm winning.

48
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:17,500
'Cause I give you all of me, and you give me all of you.

49
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,000
I give you all of me,

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,235
And you give me all of you, oh.

51
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,520

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,380
