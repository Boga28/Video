1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:09,689
Every night you dream at least, at least 10
dreams a night. Do you remember your dreams?

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:15,940
If you do, you're well on your way to having
some fantastic times when you close your eyes.

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,359
Today I'm going to teach you about one of my
favourite things in the world ever - dreams

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,384
and dreaming. Maybe you know the Supertramp
song: "Dreamer". I'm not going to sing it

5
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:31,483
for you, but I'm going to teach you
about some things I know about dreams.

6
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:40,480
The first one is I want you to ask yourself
this question: When you dream, do you dream

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:48,390
only in black and white or do you dream in
colour? It's interesting because everyone's

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,374
different. When I dream, I always dream in
colour. Some people only dream in black and

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,610
white, so it's a cool little thing you can
ask your friends, ask your family, and see,

10
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,640
you'll find out everyone's different. Some
people only dream in colour; some people only

11
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,783
dream in black and white. I do not know the
psychology behind it. I think it's interesting,

12
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:13,533
but I don't know why.

13
00:01:13,924 --> 00:01:19,890
The second question that I have for you is:
When you dream, are you yourself? This means

14
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,000
first-person. So, are you...? Are you doing
the action? Or are you watching or seeing

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,360
yourself do the action? Some people are both,
and can do both; it can switch. For me, I

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:44,680
am always myself doing the action. Some people,
it's like they're watching a movie, and they

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,979
are the star in the movie. And other people,
like I said, can switch and do both. At one

18
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:57,299
point of the dream they can be a main character,
and the other point or other dream, they can

19
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,670
watch themselves. How about you? Tell me your
answers in the comments. Tell me. Do you dream

20
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,699
in black and white, or colour? And are you
yourself in the dream or do you see or watch

21
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:15,249
yourself in a dream? We'll do a little survey
and find out from answers all around the world.

22
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,033
What happens when you dream?

23
00:02:17,059 --> 00:02:24,900
Let's go into some terminology, some vocabulary,
if you will, about dreams. Commonly... We

24
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,969
don't really have a word for them because
we don't call them "night dreams", but we

25
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:35,829
do have what are called "daydreams". "Daydreams"
are what you maybe do at work when you're

26
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:41,400
supposed to be working or at school when you're
supposed to be learning, or just at the end

27
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:50,319
of the day on the bus. Daydreams are basically
like you are physically there, but your brain

28
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,249
is imagining different things. This is one
of my hobbies, daydreaming. I remember when

29
00:02:56,249 --> 00:03:03,519
I was young-I'm so old now-I would just sit in
my room for hours and daydream about everything

30
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:13,327
and anything. It was fantastic. My imagination,
massive. So daydreams happen during the daytime,

31
00:03:13,353 --> 00:03:18,410
yeah? And "night dreams", we don't actually
call them "night dreams", we just call them

32
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:28,620
"dreams". Are you a dreamer? "A dreamer" is
someone who dreams, daydreams all the time.

33
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,559
They don't really get a lot done. But I'm
a dreamer. You got to have dreams, right?

34
00:03:35,637 --> 00:03:41,364
Let's go through a couple of kinds of types of
dreams. The first one is "lucid". So "lucid

35
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:49,529
dreams" mean you realize in the dream that
you are actually dreaming. Now, this, ladies

36
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:56,462
and gentlemen, can be really cool because
you might wake up during the dream, and you

37
00:03:56,488 --> 00:04:03,859
go: "Hey, I'm dreaming right now." If you can
do this, if you can realize you're having

38
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:10,269
a lucid dream, you can then begin to control your
dreams. This is one thing that I experimented

39
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,779
with when I was younger is that I would realize
that I was dreaming, and I would change my

40
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:24,179
dream and make it more into a fantasy. A
fantastic fantasy of feathers and fudgesicles.

41
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:31,409
This is a really terrible kind of dream, it's
called a "nightmare". Nightmares are also

42
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:38,888
known as "bad dreams". Usually when we're
children, we're sleeping, we might

43
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:39,511
[screams]

44
00:04:39,537 --> 00:04:46,340
wake up, screaming or crying. Maybe we have
dreams about monsters. This would be a nightmare.

45
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,696
Bad dreams or nightmares cause anxiety, so
something bad is happening to you in the dream,

46
00:04:52,722 --> 00:04:59,422
you might dream of death, somebody's dead.
Maybe you watched a zombie movie, and in your

47
00:04:59,448 --> 00:05:05,259
dream, you're being chased by zombies. It's
on a subconscious level, so things that we

48
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:12,060
might have done in the day or talked about
or seen can come back in our dream. They can

49
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,178
come back in a bad way, and become a nightmare.
You might wake up screaming, or crying, or

50
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:20,705
something bad has happened
in your dream world.

51
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:29,379
And some people have what's called a "reoccurring
dream", a "recurring dream" means you have

52
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:39,129
the same dream over and over again. Again,
lucid dreams, if you can control them, some

53
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,000
people can control them; nightmares and recurring
dreams, it's almost impossible to control

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,669
them. Now, reoccurring dreams will happen, we
don't know when, we don't really know why,

55
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:56,105
but it'll be the same situation and the same
dream over and over again. It can go on for

56
00:05:56,131 --> 00:06:03,766
years. People say you have this because you have
some issue or some problem that's unresolved,

57
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:10,661
means you haven't fixed a problem. Other people
just don't know why we have reoccurring dreams.

58
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:15,163
Have you had a reoccurring dream,
or do you have those? I never have.

59
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:23,750
The next word is "prophetic dreams" or known
as "psychic dreams". And you might hear the

60
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:30,870
word "psychic" on TV or in crazy movies where
there's a person that can tell you your future

61
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:36,254
or foretell the future. These people might be
doing it for money, or they might actually

62
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:43,163
have a gift to be able to foretell the future.
But some people can have psychic or prophetic

63
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:50,770
dreams, which means something will happen in
the dream and then it'll come true in the

64
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:57,554
future. So your dream foretells the future.
This happens to me quite a lot. It won't be

65
00:06:57,554 --> 00:07:04,103
the same situation, but the emotion or feeling
that I have in the dream will happen in real

66
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:10,031
life again. It's pretty creepy, but
interesting. I've gotten used to it.

67
00:07:11,226 --> 00:07:16,780
These are some common themes or common things
that people have analyzed dreams, and they

68
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,699
tell you about why you dream this. So, the
first one: being chased. So if you're running

69
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:28,610
and running and running, and someone chases
you, they tell you that... "They" being the

70
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,823
dream experts mean that you're not addressing
something in your life. So not addressing

71
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:45,169
something means you're not solving a problem
you have in your life, or you're not admitting

72
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:50,537
to a problem you have. So, you're being chased
because you're not stopping, and going:

73
00:07:50,563 --> 00:07:52,991
"Hey. I got a problem."

74
00:07:53,694 --> 00:08:00,349
Anytime you dream about water, it always has
to do with your emotions, and the different

75
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:04,999
types of water can mean different things.
For example, if you're at a lake and it's

76
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:10,430
very calm, this is going to mean that maybe
in the future you're going to have a calmness

77
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,249
or everything's going to be relaxed. If you
have a dream where maybe you're in the ocean

78
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:22,291
and waves are crazy, this means your emotions
are going to get very high and very tense.

79
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:29,639
Death, example you have a dream that somebody
dies, actually it doesn't that somebody's

80
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,400
going to die. It actually means there's going to
be a dramatic change in your life, so something

81
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,950
in your life is going to change in a big style,
in a big way. Maybe you're going to move or

82
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,264
something is going
to change your life.

83
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:53,774
Falling, this happens to me a lot. This is
cool. People say that if you fall in your

84
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:03,080
dream, you always wake up before you land.
Apparently, if you die in your dream, you

85
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,890
die in real life. I don't know. I've never
died in my dream. Have you? Have you come

86
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:17,190
back from the dead? Are you a zombie? So dreaming
of falling, if you are falling very slowly

87
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:23,630
almost like you're floating, it means that
you're letting go of some emotions or you're

88
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:32,430
letting go of some problems. But if you're
falling really quickly, I'm going to die,

89
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:38,370
it means that you're going to lose control of
a situation or you already have lost control

90
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,880
of a situation, or you're going to lose control
of a situation. So the forms, how fast you

91
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,422
fall, depends on the
interpretation of it.

92
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:55,250
And the last one, apparently this is a really
common or popular dream. People have dreams

93
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:03,100
that their partner-boyfriend/girlfriend, husband/wife,
whatever-are cheating on them, that means

94
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,156
that they're having sex or doing bad things
with other people. This is actually a really,

95
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:16,590
really common dream, and it's a fear of being
wronged. "Wronged" means someone does something

96
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,650
bad to you. So this is a fear we have, that
someone's going to hurt you in some way, or

97
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:31,130
you have a feeling of being... Sorry, a fear
of being left alone or abandoned because if

98
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,337
someone cheats on you, probably
your relationship will be over,

99
00:10:35,673 --> 00:10:37,992
and the person's gone
out of your life.

100
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:43,789
So, other things you guys can do to help
you with your dreams. I hear people say:

101
00:10:43,815 --> 00:10:49,884
"I don't dream." You do dream, but the
thing is you don't remember your dreams.

102
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:54,201
We only remember the dreams
that you wake up during.

103
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:58,250
If you want to, just for
fun, you can make a dream

104
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:02,909
diary. So if you wake up, you write down your
dreams. And you wake up in the morning, go:

105
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:04,133
"Whoa.

106
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:10,392
I don't remember that." You don't remember
it because it's gone. So if you write it...

107
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:13,852
Wake up and write it down and you
can read it, it's really cool.

108
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:21,000
Last piece of advice or a myth, a legend,
my grandmother or my gran told me that if

109
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,676
you have a dream that the stone is missing
from a ring... For example, I have a ring

110
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:33,418
and I have an amethyst in it, if I have a
dream that a stone is missing from the ring,

111
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:41,038
it means that someone close to me is going
to die. Have you ever had that dream?

112
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:43,320
Maybe it's true, maybe it's not.

113
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:48,300
All of these things that I've told you about
being chased, and water, and death, these

114
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:56,698
are all people's interpretations of dreams. I
do not believe that your dream and my dream,

115
00:11:56,752 --> 00:12:02,930
if it's similar, has any similarities whatsoever.
I think people's dreams are as individual

116
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:08,410
as each other, so you can go on to the internet,
and look up: "Oh, I had a dream about a van.

117
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,110
What does a van mean?" And you're going to
get maybe five different interpretations of

118
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,640
it. It's your chance to think about it, and
reflect on what dreams mean to you. Not anyone

119
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,383
else or not anyone's interpretation
of it, but try it out.

120
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:28,610
The last thing you can do just before you go
to bed, try this social experiment. Before

121
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:36,930
you go to bed, eat cheese. The stinkier, the
smeller, the grosser the cheese, apparently

122
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,733
the more vivid or crazy
your dreams will be.

123
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,567
Sweet dreams.
