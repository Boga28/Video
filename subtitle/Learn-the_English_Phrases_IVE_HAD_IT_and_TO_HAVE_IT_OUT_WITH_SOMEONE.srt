1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,130
In this English lesson
I wanted to help you

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:04,620
learn the English phrase, I've had it!

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,020
Now simply used, this simply means

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,710
that you have had something.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,410
If someone says, have you had pizza?

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,560
You could say I've had it and I liked it.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,910
But we also use this phrase
to describe a situation,

8
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,100
when you want something to stop.

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,070
It's been raining a lot here lately,

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,120
you can maybe see some
puddles on the ground there

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,260
and I've had it.

12
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,090
I've had it with all the
rain we've been having.

13
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,450
That means that I wish it would stop.

14
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,950
Sometimes I use this phrase
in the classroom too.

15
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,580
When students are talking
too much, I can say, hey,

16
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,790
I've had it with all of the talking there

17
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,700
in the back of the room, please stop.

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,710
So, in English when you say I've had it,

19
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,880
it means you want something to stop.

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,570
I've certainly had it with all this rain.

21
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,170
It's just way too wet out
here, it's gotta stop soon

22
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,500
or it's not going to be a
very nice rest of the fall.

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,360
The second phrase I wanted to
teach you today is the phrase

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,070
to have it out with someone.

25
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,320
When you have it out with someone,

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,240
it means that you're annoyed
with someone about something

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,170
and maybe they're annoyed
with you about something,

28
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,959
and eventually you argue about it

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,060
or you discuss it strongly
would be a good word.

30
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,880
When you have it out with someone,

31
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,480
it usually means that there's
a little bit of arguing,

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,900
maybe some yelling involved as well.

33
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,400
Maybe my sister is doing
something regularly that annoys me

34
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,870
and I don't want to say anything,

35
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:23,450
but eventually I want
to have it out with her.

36
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,370
I'm going to tell her what
she's doing that's annoying me,

37
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,330
and we're going to have
a conversation about it.

38
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,150
And hopefully after we argue
and fight a little bit,

39
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,710
we come to a resolution.

40
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:35,210
By the way, I don't really
actually fight with my sisters

41
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,140
they're very nice people,

42
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,230
and that was just an example.

43
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,830
Anyways, to review when
you say I've had it,

44
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,300
it simply means that you
are done with something,

45
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,010
you want something to stop.

46
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,840
My example was that I've
had it with all this rain

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,110
I hope it stops soon.

48
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,230
And then when you have
it out with someone,

49
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,740
it means that you argue with
them, you fight with them.

50
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,500
You talk about whatever the two of you

51
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,030
have been disagreeing about,

52
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,510
you just have it out with them

53
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,550
and then hopefully you resolve it.

54
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,180
Hey, let's look at a comment
from a previous video.

55
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,450
This comment is from Mat,
and the comment is this.

56
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,780
Oscar thinking, I can't be bothered

57
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,660
to say hello to everyone.

58
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,680
This is from the video
a couple of days ago,

59
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,260
where Oscar was kind of grouchy

60
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,770
and sitting on the picnic table.

61
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,490
My response, he's like that sometimes

62
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,880
when I'm out with the camera.

63
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,760
He does the same thing
whenever someone has a camera

64
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,420
and tries to take a picture of him.

65
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,920
He does not like the camera at all.

66
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,310
So Oscar is a unique dog.

67
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,370
He, well, maybe there's
other dogs like this as well,

68
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,080
but he certainly does
not enjoy the camera.

69
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,890
The camera when I bring
out my video camera,

70
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,190
when any of my kids try
to take a picture of him,

71
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,170
he usually tries to hide or he goes away

72
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,970
or he acts a little bit grouchy.

73
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,320
Now, the other day he was acting that way

74
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,040
because Jen was on her way to market.

75
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,730
And he knows when Jen is leaving,

76
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,890
and that makes him really really sad,

77
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,170
Hey, it's Thanksgiving
weekend here in Canada.

78
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,333
I'm actually filming this
video, let me spin you around.

79
00:03:02,247 --> 00:03:05,970
I'm actually filming this
video on a Saturday afternoon.

80
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,480
I'm filming it a little bit early

81
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
because I wanna spend some
time with family later today

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,920
and later this weekend.

83
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,510
And I just wanted to show
you some of the bouquets

84
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,510
that Jen has for sale
out here on the wagon.

85
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,130
You can see that they
are all nicely designed

86
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,230
using fall colors.

87
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,130
Fall colors are any colors that are dark

88
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,660
are burgundies and other types of colors.

89
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,860
And you can see, we put
these little flags up to try

90
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,830
and attract people to pull
in and to buy some flowers.

91
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,200
Sales have been pretty good this weekend,

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,880
but they could be better.

93
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,430
Hopefully they get better
over the next little while

94
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,770
as the rest of this afternoon goes by.

95
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,230
Anyways thanks for watching,
happy Thanksgiving.

96
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,350
It's Thanksgiving day here,

97
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,410
October 11th, Monday, October 11th.

98
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,480
The day you're watching this

99
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,670
is probably Thanksgiving
day here in Canada.

100
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,970
I'm thankful for all of you.

101
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,730
Thanks for watching, have a great day.

102
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,663
Bye.
