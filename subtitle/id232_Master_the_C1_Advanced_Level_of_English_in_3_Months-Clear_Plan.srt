00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,260
-Hello, lovely students and welcome back to 
English with Lucy! Does any of this sound  

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,620
painfully familiar to you? Your grammar and 
vocabulary are good, but you know that your  

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,100
wording doesn't always sound natural. You can 
follow conversations in English, but you miss  

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:28,800
out on jokes, nuance and hidden meanings. You can 
speak well, but you still don't feel 100% relaxed  

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,280
and confident when you talk with English-speaking 
friends or co-workers. English still requires so  

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,380
much of your energy, and it leaves you feeling 
drained, and maybe you feel that your current  

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:46,620
English level prevents you from showing your 
true personality and intelligence, and that  

8
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,800
doesn't feel very nice. Could you relate to any 
of that? If yes, you are in the right place. I  

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,520
have created a solution for you. Introducing 
the beautiful British English C1 Programme.  

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,020
This programme is a 12-week course designed to 
take you from upper-intermediate B2 English to  

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,920
advanced English, the C1 level, as defined by 
the CEFR. If you think you already have the C1,  

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,880
keep watching. In this programme, we cover a 
lot of C2-level content. We really overshoot,  

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,000
so this could be really relevant for you too. When 
you achieve the C1 level, you will feel confident  

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,720
having deep conversations about any topic. 
You will also be able to understand jokes,  

15
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,260
nuances and hidden meanings. You will feel 
totally capable of working in an English-speaking  

16
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:46,680
environment. I'm going to help you tweak your 
already good English skills so that you can move  

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,240
towards perfection and native-like fluency. The 
programme works by making sure you focus on nuance  

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,280
and pronunciation from day one. We take everyday 
situations like family, work and leisure and teach  

19
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:09,479
you the advanced vocabulary in context through a 
storyline. And we take real native conversations,  

20
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,260
break them down and analyse them so that you 
understand 100% of the meaning and the implied  

21
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,720
meaning. We even train you to write beautifully 
with targeted writing training sessions. This  

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,800
programme is truly unlike any other. Let me show 
you the four elements that make it so unique and  

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,180
so effective. Number one, the most important, in 
my opinion, nail the nuances. Have you ever been  

24
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,960
in a group situation where someone says something 
that is seemingly meaningless and everyone laughs  

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,420
apart from you? I can relate to this so deeply. 
It happened throughout the learning stages of my  

26
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:55,020
second and third languages. Often, this is due 
to a very subtle but impactful concept. Nuance,  

27
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:01,440
nuance, a beautiful word in itself. Nuances are 
the subtle differences in meaning between words,  

28
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,580
phrases, grammatical structures and ideas. 
And these shades of meaning might seem small,  

29
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,460
but they can greatly affect how we understand 
what is being said. Once you master these,  

30
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:20,340
you can express yourself in exactly the way you 
want, sound completely natural whilst doing it,  

31
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,480
and totally understand others. This is exactly 
what we teach you in this programme. Number two,  

32
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,200
and this is a totally new concept. For my 
programmes, we've introduced story-based  

33
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,660
learning. This is a method that is going to keep 
you engaged and motivated throughout this entire  

34
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:46,500
programme. The entire programme comes in a story 
format that develops over the course of 12 weeks.  

35
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,400
Every reading and every listening tells part of 
the story. You won't want to miss a single week.  

36
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,120
The story is based on real-life situations, so 
you've got ample opportunities to learn slang,  

37
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:08,520
pronunciation, and relevant vocabulary. Number 
three, advanced conversation breakdown. Elevate  

38
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,040
your fluency through real conversations with 
interesting people in my life. In this programme,  

39
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,760
you have 12 really interesting conversation 
lessons. We take these conversations and we  

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,280
break them down so that you can understand 
100% of the words, and more importantly,  

41
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:34,200
100% of their implied meaning. We look at the 
nuances of their grammar, the rules they do use or  

42
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:40,680
don't use. We discuss the pronunciation rules that 
they follow, or break, again, those all-important  

43
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,440
nuances. We analyse the humour they use. We 
break down their vocabulary and their spoken  

44
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:52,080
English. There is so much to gain from these 
conversation lessons. My conversation analysis  

45
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,700
technique allows you to move from good English 
to native-level English fast. And number four,  

46
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:06,720
pronunciation from day one. I cannot overstate 
the importance of pronunciation. Pronunciation  

47
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,180
is integrated throughout the entire programme 
so that you eliminate bad habits and form good  

48
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,560
habits from day one. We have 12 pronunciation deep 
dive sessions, but pronunciation is also woven  

49
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,080
throughout every other lesson, especially those 
conversation lessons that I mentioned before.  

50
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,620
Many students receive poor pronunciation education 
in their formative years of learning. This  

51
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,800
leaves them with bad habits that are difficult to 
unlearn. In my classes, we break those bad habits  

52
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,100
and we focus on correct, clear pronunciation. 
I've trained thousands of students to speak with  

53
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:50,820
Beautiful British English pronunciation. Modern 
RP, that's my accent. If that's what you desire,  

54
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,580
we can work on that. If you just want to speak 
clearly and be understood, this programme will  

55
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,340
help you massively with that. Whatever your goal, 
you'll be able to fit in and live life speaking  

56
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:08,460
and sounding the way you want. Now, I said there 
were four key elements. There's actually one more,  

57
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,880
and this one is for students that really 
want to make fast progress. It's optional,  

58
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,760
but previous course students have said that this 
was the most valuable part of the programme for  

59
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:29,460
them. The VIP Feedback Pack. With this option, you 
get weekly feedback opportunities. 12 writing or  

60
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:36,840
speaking tasks that my team of expert C1 teachers 
will correct and provide feedback on. This is  

61
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,180
your opportunity to put what you've learnt into 
practice, receive corrections, and supercharge  

62
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:48,960
your progress. For me, one of the most amazing 
points is the pronunciation feedback. My teachers  

63
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,500
are just amazing at pinpointing those little 
tweaks that you can make to sound truly natural  

64
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:01,260
when you speak. If you don't want feedback, don't 
worry. You still get access to the private course  

65
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:07,260
community and my teachers. Every question you 
have about the course will be answered in the  

66
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,780
private course community. This way, you'll never 
get stuck. You'll never remain confused. This is  

67
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:20,160
the perfect course for busy people. Self-study 
materials with teacher support. So what do you get  

68
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,360
in the Beautiful British English C1 Programme? You 
get 12 really interesting modules that teach you  

69
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,100
easy to digest fluency elements through story to 
help you sound undeniably natural in three months.  

70
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:42,420
Each module has five to six video lessons with me. 
That's over 60 in total. The lessons are really  

71
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:50,220
visual and they all have optional subtitles. We 
have five lesson concepts, vocabulary, grammar,  

72
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:58,440
writing, pronunciation, and conversation. We 
cover listening, reading, speaking, and writing,  

73
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,500
all the skills throughout the programme. We have 
downloadable lesson PDFs and mind maps so that you  

74
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:11,880
can visualise and revise more complex grammar and 
vocabulary concepts. These are perfect for visual  

75
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,620
learners. If you're unsure that you know enough 
grammar to participate in a C1 level programme,  

76
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,520
we've included B2 level revision PDFs so that 
you can refresh your memory and prepare yourself  

77
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,240
before you start each C1 level grammar lesson. 
We have included hundreds and hundreds and  

78
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,080
hundreds of exercises, transcriptions, listening 
tests, reading comprehensions, gap fills, grammar  

79
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,780
quizzes, spelling tests, there are so many. This 
way you can put what you've learnt into practice  

80
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:48,900
and boost your memory and retention. We've also 
included pronunciation lessons and exercises so  

81
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,200
that you can speak clearly and be understood by 
native speakers. We also have weekly speaking and  

82
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,580
writing homework with personal teacher feedback if 
you opt for the VIP feedback pack. Everyone gets  

83
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,120
16 weeks of access to our private course community 
where you can connect to like-minded learners and  

84
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,640
stay motivated. My expert team of teachers will 
help you out and answer your questions so you  

85
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,700
never get stuck. Take a look at what some of my 
amazing previous course students have to say.

86
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,360
- I feel more confident when I speak English 
and I can read an article faster than before.  

87
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,020
I learned so many new words, idioms 
and phrases. I'm so happy about that.

88
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:40,800
- I've learned lots of grammar, vocabulary 
and even pronunciation. I feel much more  

89
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,980
confident with my speaking. There was a 
lot of exercises. That's just amazing.  

90
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,250
You can check your knowledge. 
That made me enjoy the journey.

91
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,360
- I love the way Lucy explained grammar and  

92
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,700
vocabulary. That helps me a lot. And I 
loved the conversation lesson the most.

93
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:07,320
- I highly encourage you to enrol. You will 
enjoy it and you will definitely not regret it.

94
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,900
- I'm so proud of them. They did so well. I 
really hope you can join them. At the end of  

95
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:18,960
the Beautiful British English C1 Programme, 
you have a final exam. You will also get a  

96
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,780
