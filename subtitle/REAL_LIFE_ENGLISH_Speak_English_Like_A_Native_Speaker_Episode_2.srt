1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,190
Hey, welcome to episode two of
the real life English series.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,050
In today's episode, I am going to
teach you real English vocabulary,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,850
real English expressions.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,270
And I'm also going to teach you a fluency
pattern that you can use today and sound

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,250
more like a native English speaker.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,930
When you request something.

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,200
I also have some quizzes just for you.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,020
So I hope you're  ready.

9
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:27,825
All right.

10
00:00:28,185 --> 00:00:28,814
I'm teacher

11
00:00:28,814 --> 00:00:31,755
Tiffani. Let's jump right in.

12
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:32,473
All right.

13
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:38,474
So we're going to start off by looking at
a situation, a real life situation here.

14
00:00:38,474 --> 00:00:43,875
We have a man and a woman sitting
together looking at their cell phones.

15
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:49,965
Now the woman is probably saying,
honey, you are more tech savvy than me.

16
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:53,175
Can you please show me how to work?

17
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,644
This new phone you bought?

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,470
Now, this is a very natural
conversation a very natural request

19
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,120
that this woman is making, but
what's the pattern that she used.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,310
Let me show you the pattern she used.

21
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,960
She said his name or a
nickname, which is honey.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,530
And I'll explain.

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,570
Then she gave the reason
or the current situation.

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,750
And finally she made her request.

25
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,720
She didn't just immediately
make the request.

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,230
She followed this
pattern and this formula.

27
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,550
Now I do want to explain something
to you really quickly, honey, you may

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,380
be asking teacher, what does honey?

29
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:40,785
Now honey is just a term of
endearment for someone you love.

30
00:01:40,815 --> 00:01:45,525
So for example, my mother will
call my father, honey, or dear.

31
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:49,345
Likewise, my father will call
my mother, honey or dear.

32
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:52,485
So you can call your spouse,
your boyfriend, or your

33
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:54,495
girlfriend, honey, in English.

34
00:01:54,495 --> 00:01:57,525
We say, honey, good job.

35
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:59,774
One more time after me, honey.

36
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:01,619
Excellent.

37
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,130
All right.

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,059
Now she also said something that
maybe you haven't heard before.

39
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:12,480
She said tech savvy after me tech savvy.

40
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,310
Excellent.

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:22,620
Now tech savvy just means well informed
about or good at using modern technology.

42
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,750
So maybe you are tech savvy.

43
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,130
Maybe you are really good at
using computers and cell phones

44
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,380
and other things you can say.

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,110
Ah, I'm tech savvy.

46
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:39,464
It makes sense right now, look again,
at what she said, she said, honey, the

47
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:42,795
name you are more tech savvy than me.

48
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:46,364
She's giving the reason
before she makes the request.

49
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:51,315
You're so good with technology right now.

50
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:52,455
The request comes.

51
00:02:52,455 --> 00:02:55,125
Can you please show me, right.

52
00:02:55,335 --> 00:02:57,945
So what about this last part work?

53
00:02:57,975 --> 00:03:01,395
This, what does it mean to work something?

54
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:06,075
This is again a real English
expression, real life English.

55
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:10,655
Work something means to use something.

56
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:11,315
Right?

57
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:14,735
So for example, I have
my cell phone right here.

58
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:17,495
I am very familiar with my cell phone.

59
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:22,025
I know how to work it because
I've used it for a while.

60
00:03:22,325 --> 00:03:25,595
So this individual was
telling her husband, Hey baby.

61
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:27,905
Hey honey, you're tech savvy.

62
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,095
You're really good with technology.

63
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,715
Can you please help me?

64
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:32,975
I don't know how to.

65
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:34,470
Makes sense.

66
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,970
Right?

67
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,340
So once again, looking at this image at
this situation, we have the pattern name

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,959
plus reason or situation plus the request.

69
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,640
And this is exactly how you
are going to use the pattern.

70
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:56,204
Now, let me quiz you and see if you
remember the words I just taught you.

71
00:03:56,415 --> 00:03:58,125
Are you ready for our first quiz?

72
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,204
I hope you are.

73
00:04:00,105 --> 00:04:00,704
Here we go.

74
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:02,295
All right, quiz number one.

75
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:06,495
Now you only have five
seconds for each question.

76
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:07,155
Here we go.

77
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:08,565
Now let's see.

78
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:11,055
The first question is right here.

79
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:14,025
I want you to fill in the blank.

80
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,140
Technology is a big part of life.

81
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,790
So little kids are very five seconds.

82
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,250
All right.

83
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,330
Time.

84
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,710
What is the answer?

85
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,050
Yes, you got it.

86
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,920
Exactly.

87
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,910
Little kids are.

88
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:38,415
Tech savvy makes sense.

89
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:38,915
Right?

90
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,075
A lot of kids, even my four
year old niece, she's really

91
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,955
good with technology tech savvy.

92
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:49,065
All right, let's see how you
do with question number two.

93
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:49,755
Here we go.

94
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,825
Question number two, fill in the blank.

95
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:59,655
He just bought a new, smart TV
for his office, but he doesn't

96
00:04:59,655 --> 00:05:03,045
know how to what's the answer.

97
00:05:03,255 --> 00:05:04,155
Five seconds.

98
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:04,715
Here we go.

99
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:10,035
Do do do, do all right time.

100
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:11,355
What's the answer.

101
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:12,505
Come on, you got it.

102
00:05:13,034 --> 00:05:14,145
Exactly.

103
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:19,515
He doesn't know how to work
it or use it make sense.

104
00:05:19,515 --> 00:05:20,025
Right.

105
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,315
Excellent job.

106
00:05:21,344 --> 00:05:21,945
Excellent.

107
00:05:22,215 --> 00:05:27,494
Now let's see another situation that
uses the pattern that we learned.

108
00:05:27,734 --> 00:05:28,304
Here we go.

109
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:30,015
Here is the next situation.

110
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:36,850
We have again, what looks like a husband
and a wife now in this situation, the

111
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,730
woman is probably saying, Michael,
you know that you tower over me.

112
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,810
Would you put the meat on
the top shelf of the freezer?

113
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,730
Pretty please.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,510
All right.

115
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,120
So we're seeing here that a request
is being made, but the woman

116
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,240
is using the fluency pattern.

117
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,530
Let me show you watch right.

118
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,020
She did.

119
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,240
What said his name?

120
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:09,630
Michael then gave the reason
Michael you tower over me now.

121
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,110
Wait a minute.

122
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,000
What does tower over me mean?

123
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,480
All right.

124
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:19,020
So tower over just means to be much
taller than someone or something.

125
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,530
The man in the picture is
much taller than the lady.

126
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,410
Actually, my brother-in-law
is about six, two or six.

127
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,469
He towers over us.

128
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,539
He's extremely tall.

129
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:36,300
So again, following the pattern, when
you're making a request name, then the

130
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,669
reason the woman said you tower over me.

131
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,710
You're so much taller than me.

132
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,880
Now.

133
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,349
It's time for the request.

134
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:49,724
She says, "Would put the meat
on the top shelf of the freezer?

135
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:51,305
Pretty please?"

136
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:53,925
Now, what does pretty please mean?

137
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:57,465
Again, real life English, English we use.

138
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:58,245
Here we go.

139
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:05,414
Pretty please actually means it's used to
ask someone for something or persuading

140
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:08,174
them to do something by sounding.

141
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:09,624
friendly.

142
00:07:09,825 --> 00:07:10,425
That's right.

143
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:14,835
When you say, oh, pretty please,
you're trying to sound friendly.

144
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:18,885
You're trying to make them see that
I really need your help in English.

145
00:07:18,885 --> 00:07:20,985
We do say pretty, please.

146
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:24,555
Now guys, you probably don't
want to say it, but women and

147
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:26,475
children, we do actually say it.

148
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:30,525
So we say pretty please
after me, pretty please.

149
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,250
Excellent.

150
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,030
Good job.

151
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,760
So she said pretty, please.

152
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,190
Now you already know what time it is.

153
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,020
It's time for your next quiz.

154
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,130
Let's see if you understood
exactly what we just went over.

155
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,780
All right.

156
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,620
So each question again,
remember you have five seconds.

157
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,550
So here is the first question, right?

158
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:54,674
Fill in the blank.

159
00:07:55,335 --> 00:08:02,775
She likes short guys because tall
guys, usually her, you ready?

160
00:08:02,895 --> 00:08:03,734
Five seconds.

161
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:06,015
What goes in the blank here?

162
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,530
Time.

163
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,150
All right.

164
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,920
So what goes in the blank?

165
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,820
I know you got it.

166
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:18,860
Yes, very good tower over her.

167
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,630
She likes short guys because
tall guys tower over her.

168
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,680
Excellent job.

169
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:25,550
Really good.

170
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,390
All right.
Now let's go to question number two.

171
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,020
Here we go.

172
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,650
Number two.

173
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,929
The little girl wanted ice cream.

174
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,700
What did she say to her mother?

175
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,590
She wanted ice cream.

176
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,059
What did she say?

177
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,840
Here we go.

178
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,730
Timer has started da, da, da time.

179
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,270
All right.

180
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,699
So what did the little girl say?

181
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,510
Come on.
I know.

182
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,530
Excellent.

183
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,900
She said pretty please.

184
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,070
Very good.

185
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,030
Excellent job.

186
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:57,650
All right.

187
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,030
So again, we had two situations where
the individuals followed the fluency

188
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:08,790
pattern for making a request, name,
reason or situation, and then the request.

189
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,120
Well, let's see if it happens
in this situation as well.

190
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,380
In this situation, we have a
woman and she's on the phone

191
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,670
and she's probably saying.

192
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,940
Hey, Susan, I'm trying to
knock out my resume, but it's

193
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,220
taking longer than I expected.

194
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,310
I know you are the resume guru.

195
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:35,750
So would you mind looking over
it for me now in this situation?

196
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,620
She, also used the fluency pattern.

197
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,120
Let me show it to you again.

198
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,860
The pattern name.

199
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,880
Hey, Susan.

200
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,319
Reason or situation.

201
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:52,949
I'm trying to knock out my resume, but
it's taking longer than I expected now.

202
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:55,050
That's the reason and her situation.

203
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,770
But what does knock out mean?

204
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,200
So knock out actually means to
complete or finish something.

205
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,270
So to knock something out, for
example, oh, I need to knock out dinner

206
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,370
before I go hang out with my friends.

207
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,070
I need to complete or make dinner.

208
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,320
Before I go out with my friends, we
say, knock out something in English.

209
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:24,195
Real life English, and
now you can also use it.

210
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:28,695
So she's trying to knock
out or complete her resume.

211
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:33,495
She also says it's taking
longer than I expected.

212
00:10:33,795 --> 00:10:36,515
So what does longer than expected mean?

213
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:40,575
It means to take longer
than you initially.

214
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,450
Thought it would.

215
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,010
So she's giving the reason and
she's also giving her situation

216
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,130
before she makes her request.

217
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,340
This is how you speak
English in real life.

218
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,280
You don't just immediately
make your request.

219
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,689
You need to say the name.

220
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:02,535
Give the reason, our situation
and then make the request.

221
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:07,425
So now she's starting to make the
request after she says, I know you

222
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:14,265
are the resume guru, she then says, so
would you mind looking over it for me?

223
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:15,525
That's her request.

224
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,744
But what does it mean
to look over something?

225
00:11:19,984 --> 00:11:26,675
Look over something just means to
review or check something for errors.

226
00:11:26,824 --> 00:11:32,405
So she's asking her, Hey, I know you're
the resume guru, that's the situation.

227
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:36,935
And the reason would you mind
just kind of checking my resume.

228
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:39,005
That was the request.

229
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:42,694
So again, she followed the
pattern name plus reason or

230
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:45,364
situation, and then the request.

231
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:52,155
So, you know what time it is now,
it's time for your last quiz.

232
00:11:52,155 --> 00:11:53,415
Let's see how you're going to do.

233
00:11:53,655 --> 00:11:54,165
Here we go.

234
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:59,595
Now we have five questions for this quiz,
and I know that you are going to do well.

235
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:00,465
Here we go.

236
00:12:01,035 --> 00:12:01,694
First.

237
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:04,425
Now it's a combination now
of everything you've learned.

238
00:12:05,055 --> 00:12:08,444
My husband loves computers.

239
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:11,415
He is really what's the answer.

240
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:12,495
I'm gonna give you five seconds.

241
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:12,975
Here we go.

242
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:13,485
Five seconds.

243
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:20,495
You got it.

244
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,444
Her husband is what?

245
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:22,865
Come on.

246
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:24,485
I know you asked, you know, the answer.

247
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:29,225
Excellent tech savvy,
so good, excellent job.

248
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:32,105
Her husband is tech savvy.

249
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,964
Very, very good.

250
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:36,845
All right, now let's go
to question number two.

251
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:37,385
Here we go.

252
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:38,045
You're doing great.

253
00:12:38,045 --> 00:12:40,355
So far question number two.

254
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:42,005
What is a term?

255
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:48,344
That a woman might use
to call her husband.

256
00:12:48,494 --> 00:12:52,005
What's a term that a woman
might use to call her husband.

257
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:52,574
Here we go.

258
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:53,074
Five seconds.

259
00:12:58,085 --> 00:12:58,475
All right.

260
00:12:58,475 --> 00:12:59,285
What's the answer?

261
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:00,215
What's the term.

262
00:13:00,275 --> 00:13:00,875
Come on.

263
00:13:01,295 --> 00:13:03,095
Yes, honey.

264
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:03,845
Excellent.

265
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:07,205
A woman or a man would
call their spouse, honey.

266
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,405
Excellent job.

267
00:13:08,435 --> 00:13:10,205
Real life English.

268
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,285
All right, here we go.

269
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:17,975
Question number three, the
basketball player is extremely tall.

270
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,865
He blank.

All of his fans.

272
00:13:23,415 --> 00:13:24,045
Whoo.

273
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:25,185
What's this answer.

274
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:25,814

00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:27,615

Time.

279
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:32,095
What's the answer.

280
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:33,839

281
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,980
Excellent job.

282
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,030
He towers over all of his fans.

283
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,680
He's extremely tall.

284
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,400
Very good.

285
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,300
Excellent job.

286
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:45,810
All right, now let's go
to question number five.

287
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,719
Oh, number four, almost skipped one.

288
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,589
Here we go.

289
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:58,849
The little boy said he had to his homework
before he could play outside with them.

290
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:00,375

Five seconds.

292
00:14:01,035 --> 00:14:01,535

Five seconds on the clock time.

294
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:07,155
Come on.

295
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:07,845
What's the answer?

00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:09,045
Tell me what the answer is.

297
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:10,694
Exactly.

298
00:14:10,845 --> 00:14:15,824
He had to knock out or complete
his homework before he could

299
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:17,145
play outside with them.

300
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:18,915
Now, one more quiz question.

301
00:14:18,915 --> 00:14:19,425
Come on.

302
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,795
You are doing such a great job.

303
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:23,115
I know you can get this one too.

304
00:14:23,385 --> 00:14:23,925
Here we go.

305
00:14:23,985 --> 00:14:25,935
Question number five.

306
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:34,950
He bought a new cell phone yesterday,
but he still doesn't know how to yet.

307
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,780
What's the answer.

308
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,280
Five seconds on the clock.

309
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,020
Here we go

310
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,480
time.

311
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:44,910
All right.

312
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,140
So tell me, come on.

313
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,680
What's the answer.

314
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:48,555
Yes.

315
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:52,395
He doesn't know how to work it yet.

316
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:54,315
Excellent job.

317
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:57,265
You are amazing.

318
00:14:57,285 --> 00:15:01,635
You passed that quiz with flying colors.

319
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:02,355
All right.

320
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:04,995
So I really hope you
enjoyed today's lesson.

321
00:15:05,085 --> 00:15:07,845

This pattern will help you, and it will
show you how to speak English fluently.

323

When you want to make a request.

00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:15,305
Remember.

325
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:23,565
Name second part, reason or situation,
and finally make your request.

326
00:15:23,745 --> 00:15:27,315

you still there.

338
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,890
You know what time it is?

339
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,040
It's story time.

340
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,449
Hey, I said it's story time.

341
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:23,329
Okay.

342
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,819
I have a good story for you today.

343
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,620
This is something that my
family talks about all the time.

344
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:33,405
I live in Maryland.

345
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:33,974
Okay.

346
00:16:34,214 --> 00:16:38,385
And you all know how much I love food.

347
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:46,545
So in Maryland, there are a lot of west
Indians, people from Trinidad, people

348
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:50,354
from Jamaica and many other islands.

349
00:16:50,714 --> 00:16:54,525
So we have amazing west
Indian food here in Maryland.

350
00:16:54,974 --> 00:17:00,285
Now my family, we're not west Indian, but
we love west Indian food specifically.

351
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:01,815
Roti.

352
00:17:02,445 --> 00:17:07,335
So the roti we like has
cabbage and potatoes and

353
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,375
garbanzo beans and vegetables.

354
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:10,605
It's delicious.

355
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:15,825
And all throughout my high school,
years and college, and even a little

356
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:20,655
bit after college, there was one
specific restaurant we used to go to.

357
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:23,175
It was called Caribbean delight.

358
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,964
It wasn't too far from my high school.

359
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:29,385
And the owner actually worked
with my mother at the hospital.

360
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:31,620
The restaurant was her side business.

361
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,580
When I say her roti was good.

362
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,470
Oh my goodness.

363
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,649
It would make you lick your fingers.

364
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,179
That's how good the roti was.

365
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:43,230
Now.

366
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:46,050
The thing is, my mom
knew the owner very well.

367
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,980
She was the cook.

368
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:50,040
She was the owner and
they were friends at work.

369
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,730
There was nothing wrong, but there was
one unique quality about this lady.

370
00:17:55,215 --> 00:17:57,705
She did not play any games.

371
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,955
She was extremely serious.

372
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:06,105
And when you went to her restaurant, you
needed to know exactly what you wanted.

373
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:09,855
You need to know what your
request was because she didn't

374
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,415
have time for small talk.

375
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:17,205
So I remember one specific
time I was really craving.

376
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:21,975
I wanted to eat roti, so I drove
almost 30 minutes from my house just

377
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,015
to pick up some roti from a restaurant.

378
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,960
So I arrived at the restaurant and I
was going to make my request, right.

379
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,450
So I said her name and I
said, Hey, ma'am her name?

380
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,610
And then I won't say her name here.

381
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,560
And then, you know, I said, Hey, I'm here.

382
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,020
I really, really wanted
to eat some of your food.

383
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,120
So I want to order a roti.

384
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,170
You see name?

385
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,020
I told her why I came and then I made the.

386
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,310
But I had a question.

387
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:49,649
I usually just said what I wanted
and sat down and waited for it

388
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:51,120
to be given to me after I paid.

389
00:18:51,239 --> 00:18:52,800
But I had a few questions.

390
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,830
I wanted to know if they
could add some vegetable.

391
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,669
So I asked her, I said, Hey, I just
wanted to know, can this be added?

392
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:00,790
And she looked at me...

393
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,800
"Baby, you get what you pay for.

394
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,830
She really did not want
anything changed on her menu.

395
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,520
Now she was not mean.

396
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:16,635
But she did not play games and
she did not want small talk.

397
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:19,065
So she said you want to roti?

398
00:19:19,235 --> 00:19:20,435
You can't change anything.

399
00:19:20,435 --> 00:19:21,605
So I said yes ma'am yes.

400
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:22,105
Ma'am.

401
00:19:22,145 --> 00:19:26,015
I paid my money and I sat down
and I waited for my roti to come.

402
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:31,055
So I came home and I told my mom, I was
laughing because the food was so good

403
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:35,375
now in America, customer service is very
important just to help you understand.

404
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:38,225
So usually the customer's always right.

405
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:39,965
If a customer has something they want.

406
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:44,355
Then the person will kind of
adjust like at subway, you make

407
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:46,095
it your way and they do things.

408
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,580
So usually if you make a request,
you want some vegetable changed.

409
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,710
People will do that, but not this lady.

410
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,460
She said, you get what's on the
menu or you get nothing at all.

411
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,470
And we all continued to go to her
restaurant because her food was so good.

412
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,330
So we always have jokes about
her because she did not play.

413
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,240
Don't change the menu, get
whatever's on the menu.

414
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,679
And people loved her food.

415
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,540
Now she's no longer here.

416
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,159
She got sick, unfortunately.

417
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,879
And so we're not able to get her food
anymore, but we have these funny memories

418
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:25,020
of her because she did not really match
the typical American food culture.

419
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,020
She did not let you have what you wanted.

420
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:30,720
If you wanted to change anything, she
said, no, you get what's on the menu.

421
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,790
So maybe there are some people in
your country that are like that.

422
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,060
Just one way they won't change at all.

423
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,400
I hope you enjoyed this story, guys.

424
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,170
I hope you have an awesome week
and I will see you next time.

425
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,730
Don't forget to check me out.

426
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:49,100
If you want to keep studying
with me, love you all.

427
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,150
And I'll talk to you later.
