1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:05,529
My name's Ronnie and I'm going
to teach you some grammar.

2
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:12,429
It's kind of a... difficult grammar, but once
you learn this overview of-dunh, dunh, dunh,

3
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:20,470
dunh-"Auxiliary Verbs", English grammar is
going to become easier for you, I hope.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:29,650
So, if you're just beginning to learn English
grammar, oh, stay in there, you can do it.

5
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,020
Yuri, this goes out to
you in Salvador, Brazil.

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:36,690
Let's keep going, man.

7
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,030
We have three auxiliary verbs that we
use in English: "be", "do", and "have".

8
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:49,850
But the thing about the auxiliary verbs is
that each auxiliary verb will tell us what

9
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,999
kind of grammar we're
going to use with it.

10
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:55,909
So, let's look at the
first one: "be".

11
00:00:55,909 --> 00:01:03,929
So, "be" in its form in the present tense
is "am", "is", "are"; negative: "am not",

12
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,110
"isn't", and "aren't".

13
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,579
These are present.

14
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:08,159
The past tense would
be present...

15
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,610
Or, no.

16
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,259
The past tense in the positive is "was" and
"were"; negative: "wasn't" and "weren't".

17
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:17,740
So, how do we actually
use this auxiliary verb?

18
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,020
And the answer is: We use it in
two forms of English grammar.

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,280
The first one is progressive.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,869
So, if you have a progressive sentence, we
have present progressive, past progressive,

21
00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:34,119
and future progressive.

22
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,649
Every time we have a sentence in English with
progressive, we know we're going to use the

23
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,310
verb "to be".

24
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:49,399
So, if our sentence is present progressive,
we're going to use the present tense of the

25
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,240
verb "to be", "is am are"
with a verb with "ing".

26
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,020
So, in English grammar, anything that's progressive
or continuous is another word for the same

27
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,960
grammar, it's always going
to be an "ing" on the verb.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,340
The thing that changes and tells us
the grammar is the verb "to be".

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:19,120
Present is: "is", "am", "are", plus verb "ing",
but the past, we're going to use the past

30
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,209
tense: "was" and "were"
plus verb "ing".

31
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,520
So, progressive will
always have a verb "ing".

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,880
The thing that changes the tense
of it is the verb "to be".

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,480
We have future progressive
or future continuous.

34
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,069
In this one we're simply going to use the
verb "will", so in this one we have "will

35
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,970
be" plus verb "ing".

36
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:46,590
For example: "I will
be eating pizza."

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,519
This tells us what's going
to happen in the future.

38
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,290
"I was eating pizza" was the past, and "I am
eating pizza", something's happening now,

39
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,659
that's present progressive.

40
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:04,049
So, the progressive will always have the verb
"to be", either past, present, or future,

41
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,099
and it will always have
an "ing" on the verb.

42
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,159
Okay, cool.

43
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:12,390
Let's get more
complicated, okay?

44
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,379
We have another structure in
English grammar called passive.

45
00:03:15,379 --> 00:03:21,870
Now, passive voice basically you're taking
the action from the person or the focus on

46
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,750
the person, and we're putting
it towards the activity.

47
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:31,620
So, in a normal English sentence we would say:
"I eat lunch", but in a passive sentence,

48
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,310
we're taking away the subject and
we're focusing on the action.

49
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:42,299
So, with the passive voice we have future
passive, present passive, and past passive.

50
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:50,019
It goes along the same idea, is that the verb
"to be" is going to tell us: Is it present?

51
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,280
Or if it's past.

52
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,140
When we use a passive sentence, we can only
ever use the past participle of the verb,

53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,110
or the third step of the verb.

54
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,650
So, passive will always be the verb
"to be" plus the past participle.

55
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,019
If it's present, it's: "is", "am",
"are", plus PP, past participle.

56
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,890
If it's past, it's "was" and
"were" plus past participle.

57
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:19,488
It's hard to say the past
participle, so I'm going to say PP.

58
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:20,869
I have to go PP.

59
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,550
So, as an example, we say:
"Lunch is eaten", present tense.

60
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,110
"Lunch was eaten".

61
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,860
I'm going to step away and
let you check that out.

62
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,750
Let your brain absorb it.

63
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:40,530
Make some sentences using
this and the verb "to be".

64
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,121
If we used the future passive, I could say:
"Lunch will be eaten", so again, when we're

65
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:52,970
using the future, we use "will be", but
we're going to use the past participle.

66
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,060
Have you made some sentences?

67
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,990
Do it now.

68
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,280
Come on.

69
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,330
Make some sentences.

70
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,330
Go.

71
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,330
Okay.

72
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,160
So we've done the verb "to be".

73
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,840
And hopefully it's beginning to make sense,
because English grammar rarely makes sense.

74
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,460
I'm going to make it make
it make sense for you.

75
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,520
So, the next one is the
auxiliary verb "do".

76
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,710
Now, this one's interesting because we only
use it in the negative form in the simple

77
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,280
present, or we use it in
the negative simple past.

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,540
So we don't have to worry about the positive,
but we do use it for the negative in the simple

79
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,410
present and the negative in
the past, and for questions.

80
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,639
So, let's check out first the
simple present, or present simple.

81
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,919
We only use this auxiliary verb for
the negative and the question form.

82
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:55,760
So, in the negative we're going to use subject,
plus "don't" or "doesn't", plus the base verb.

83
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:02,990
Now, this is where English gets tricky and you
have to remember that if it is "I", "you",

84
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,199
"we" and "they", we use "don't".

85
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:11,889
But if it's "he", "she", or
"it", we have to use "doesn't".

86
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:12,889
So this is...

87
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,990
You always have to be careful with
your subject and your verb agreement.

88
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,350
They have to agree.

89
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,639
So, as an example: "I
don't like pizza."

90
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,759
If I used "he", I would say:
"He doesn't like pizza."

91
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,280
And we have to be careful
and use the base verb.

92
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,389
Okay?

93
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:34,650
The question would be:
"Does he like pizza?"

94
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,729
Ar?

95
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,080
Like a dog.

96
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,539
If it's a question form, we put the auxiliary
verb first: "do", "doesn't", subject, plus

97
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:44,539
the base verb.

98
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:48,130
Not the base verb,
the base verb.

99
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:53,810
We also use this in the past simple, again,
only with negative and only with a question.

100
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,330
So, the way that
we change "did"...

101
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:05,270
Sorry, "does" into the negative is "didn't"
in the past, but this is where we always make

102
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,330
a mistake.

103
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:11,330
I've told you English grammar
is crazy, I'm not joking.

104
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:16,350
When we use "didn't", we always
have to use the base verb.

105
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:24,259
So, this is where we get confused, because
we think: "Ronnie, this is past tense."

106
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:32,620
So, if it's past tense, we have to use the
past of the verb-mm-mm-because our auxiliary

107
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,320
verb "didn't" makes
the sentence past.

108
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,950
So, if it's an auxiliary verb it's going to
tell us if it's past or present, and we have

109
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,180
to use the base verb.

110
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,319
So, we have to say:
"He didn't go home."

111
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,120
You cannot say: "He
didn't went home."

112
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,780
That's grammatically wrong.

113
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,710
This verb tells us it's past, and
this verb tells us it's present.

114
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, that's kind of cool
when you learn it.

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,470
If you're doing the question form, it's very
similar to this, past tense: "Did", subject,

116
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,509
plus your base.

117
00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:12,240
Again, you always
have to be careful.

118
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,590
Even though it is past, we actually have to
use the base verb because the "did" or the

119
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,259
auxiliary verb tells us: "Hey, this
is a past tense, not a present tense.

120
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:26,690
Please use the base verb."

121
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,530
So: "Did", "didn't".

122
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,810
Ah.

123
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,360
"Didn't" in the negative
and "did" in the question.

124
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Another tip when you are speaking English and
you're asking someone a question, always

125
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,100
ask them a positive question.

126
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,660
It's more difficult for the listener, and
for the speaker, and for everyone involved

127
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,590
if you use a negative question.

128
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,870
So, just for now, you're just learning
this, always ask a positive question.

129
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,900
"Did I go home?",
"Didn't I go home?"

130
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,500
The negative question is always much more
confusing, and we need to make English grammar

131
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
simpler.

132
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Ah.

133
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
We're almost done here.

134
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,590
I'm going to step away and
let your absorb this.

135
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:27,340
Please make one, two, three, four
sentences using the auxiliary verb "do".

136
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,230
And we're back with the last one, the last
one, the most exciting one maybe ever.

137
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,700
Yeah.

138
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,070
This is the most exciting one.

139
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,120
We are going to use "have has", negative "haven't",
and "hasn't", and then we have the past: "had"

140
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
and "hadn't".

141
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,870
So, when we use the verb as an auxiliary "have",
we use it for perfect tenses in English.

142
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,900
They're so perfect.

143
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:59,190
So, when we use the perfect tense, our verb
is always going to be the past participle,

144
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,060
just like in the passive.

145
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,690
So the passive and the perfects in English,
we always use the past participle.

146
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:13,450
And again, we can have the future perfect,
we can have present perfect, and we can have

147
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,500
past perfect.

148
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:20,660
So, the way we form the future perfect is
we're going to use subject with "will", so

149
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:26,410
future we use "will" all the time,
"have", and then the past participle.

150
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,410
Okay?

151
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,040
Or we can also use "has".

152
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,430
So, the future we use "will" plus "have",
plus the past participle or the PP.

153
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,340
If we're using present perfect, we're going
to use the subject: "have" or "has", plus

154
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,870
the past participle.

155
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:50,220
So, if you can think about this: "have" in
the present tense is "have" and "has", so

156
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,890
in the past tense we're going to use
"had" plus the past participle.

157
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:04,380
So, if we're using past perfect,
we're using "had", plus PP.

158
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:10,300
If we're talking about present
perfect, we're using "has" plus PP.

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,390
People get confused and a lot of people think
that the present perfect is the present tense,

160
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,390
but it's not.

161
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,870
The present perfect
talks about the past.

162
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:29,330
The thing that makes the verb present or past
is our wonderful auxiliary verb: "have".

163
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:35,980
If the verb "have" is present perfect,
we use the present tense of the verb.

164
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:42,370
If we use the past tense, if we use past perfect,
we're going to use the past tense of "have".

165
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,810
So: "I haven't eaten lunch.

166
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,150
Oh, I'm hungry."

167
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:55,000
Future: "I will have played seven games", so
we're using "will", "have", plus the past

168
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
participle.

169
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,690
If we use present perfect, we use: "he", "she",
"it has eaten", "you already have eaten".

170
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,670
You have to be careful again on your
subject and your verb agreement.

171
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,230
There're so many
things to remember.

172
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,520
And then the past participle...

173
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:17,650
Or, sorry, the past perfect, all we're doing
is changing "has" or "have" to "had".

174
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:24,160
And this one's cool, because we don't have
to worry about "he", "she", and "it"; they

175
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,740
all use "had".

176
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,500
Thank you for being
easy, past perfect.

177
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,560

But the thing that I need you to understand
is the auxiliary verbs are going to help you

182
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,560

easier I hope.
