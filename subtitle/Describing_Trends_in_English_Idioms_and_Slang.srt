1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,890
When was the last time you heard
someone describe something as the bee's

2
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:09,210
knees or when you heard someone
brushed off a topic as passe?

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,930
You're probably looking at me
right now thinking, uh, Annemarie,

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,220
what are you talking about? And
you would be right to wonder.

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,230
When my students talk about the
latest podcast or the coolest

6
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,060
Netflix series happening right now,

7
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,340
I typically hear the words
it's so popular and that phrase

8
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,450
certainly works. But when
we're talking about trends,

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,550
there's a whole world of fun
idiomatic language and slang we

10
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,420
can use.

11
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,460
Plus just like fashion or culture
or the latest Netflix series,

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,520
language also goes through trends.

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,900
A phrase that was popular in the
past to describe something that was

14
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:56,490
particularly cool or a trend that
was popular may be outdated now.

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,900
For example, to use the
expression, the bee's knees,

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,150
no one really uses that anymore.

17
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,140
If you don't already know I'm Annemarie
with Speak Confident, English.

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,550
Everything I do here is designed to
help you get the confidence you want for

19
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,430
your life and work in
English. In this lesson today,

20
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:18,990
we're going to have a lot of fun with
language we use for describing trends.

21
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,740
What's cool right now and
what isn't cool anymore.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,600
By the end of this lesson today,

23
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,050
you'll be able to confidently
express what's trending right now.

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,670
And what's out of date using the
same expressions English speakers

25
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:37,560
use in conversations on podcasts
and on TV shows as well.

26
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,420
For today's lesson, I've divided up the
phrases into four different categories,

27
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,160
hot like fire, cool like
water, a trend, like a trend.

28
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,170
And eye-roll worthy.

29
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,743
[Inaudible].

30
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,700
First on our list is hot like fire.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,070
English speakers seem to love
expressions that are rooted in nature.

32
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,420
And quite often,

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,490
popularity is associated with the
characteristics of fire. For example,

34
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,060
imagine you're at a restaurant and
you hear a popular song come on.

35
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,160
You might say to your friend, oh, I
love this song. It's so hot right now.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,260
When we describe something as being so
hot right now we're expressing that it's

37
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:26,400
particularly trendy or it's something
that everyone loves right now.

38
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,710
Here's another example. Learning to
bake bread at home is so hot right now.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,690
In other words, everyone's doing it.
In sticking with this idea of fire,

40
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:41,670
currently English speakers
may also describe someone or

41
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:46,530
something as fire, using it as
an adjective rather than a noun.

42
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,430
Now,

43
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,380
this is very much in the slang
category of language and is best

44
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,330
used in casual situations.

45
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,350
I also have to admit that
as individuals get older,

46
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:04,330
they're less likely to use slang that
is common among teenagers and young

47
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:08,260
adults. In full disclosure,
this is not a word that I use.

48
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,830
And I actually asked my 15
year old niece about it,

49
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,960
but you might hear it. So I want
you to know why you're hearing it,

50
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:21,340
why people use it. And if
you're comfortable with it,
you could use it as well.

51
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,900
So, as I said,

52
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,460
you might hear individuals
describe someone or something as

53
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,990
fire. For example,

54
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,460
your outfit is fire or the
new Mac book pro is fire.

55
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,210
This is an alternative way to say
that something is so hot right now,

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,500
or it's really cool. And while
we're on the topic of fire,

57
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,800
let's go over one more
great expression to know,

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,920
to spread like wildfire.

59
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,870
When a trend experiences,
rapid growth and popularity.

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,220
We say that it's spreading
like wildfire. For example,

61
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:01,900
imagine one of your coworkers is talking
about an app that everyone's using

62
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,130
right now. And in the conversation
your coworker might say,

63
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,690
I can't believe how popular this app
is. It's spreading like wildfire.

64
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,531
And with that,

65
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:16,420
let's move on to our second
set of expressions under
the category of cool like

66
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:20,470
water. Sometimes we catch trends right,

67
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,410
as they start. And when talking about it,

68
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:28,270
we may want to express that a particular
new trend is creating a lot of buzz or

69
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:31,750
excitement, which means that
everyone's talking about it.

70
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,460
But it's just at the beginning
phase when something is generating a

71
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:39,040
lot of excitement and growing rapidly,

72
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:43,480
we can say that it's making
waves. Here's an example.

73
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,460
Think back to a book series that you
love and you were waiting, waiting,

74
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,360
waiting for the author to release
the next book in the series.

75
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,890
You knew that it was coming out and
there were already some reviews about it.

76
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:57,761
In a conversation,

77
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:02,530
you might say the author
hasn't even released the book

78
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:04,960
yet, but it's already making waves.

79
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:09,940
We can also use this expression
of making waves when we're talking

80
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:13,570
about the ongoing ripple
effects of a trend.

81
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,670
A ripple effect is the ongoing
result of an action. For example,

82
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:21,730
if a company like Facebook
makes a new policy,

83
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:26,620
it's going to have additional consequences
or results for other industries and

84
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:27,820
companies as well.

85
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,620
There are ripple effects in a
conversation on that topic. Again,

86
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,700
you might hear the word making
waves. Let me give you an example.

87
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,650
The updates to Google's privacy
policy is making waves across

88
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:42,610
Silicon valley.

89
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:47,860
We have one more water themed
expression we can use when a trend makes

90
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,260
a particularly large impact.

91
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,560
We can say that it's made a splash.

92
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,750
When something makes a splash,

93
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,660
not only does mean that
it had a large impact,

94
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,130
but it also has the feeling
that that impact was unexpected.

95
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,450
For example,

96
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:09,860
the newest and youngest player
is making a splash in this year's

97
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,420
NBA tournaments.

98
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:16,550
Typically we don't expect the youngest
newest player of a professional

99
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,580
basketball team to have
the biggest impact.

100
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,290
So making a splash is a
great expression to use here.

101
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,890
It expresses that this
individual is trending.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,690
Everyone's talking about this
individual and the impact they've

103
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,900
had was significant and unexpected.

104
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,030
And now category number three,
a trend like a trend. Of course,

105
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:43,490
when we want to say that
something is popular,

106
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,260
we can be explicit and simple
by simply saying that it's

107
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,060
trending right now or that
it's on trend. For example,

108
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,420
Olivia Rodrigo's song
is trending worldwide,

109
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,430
or it's on trend right now to
paint your home in earthy colors.

110
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,710
I'm curious if there's something where
you live that is particularly on trend at

111
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:10,250
the moment. It might be
someone's comments on Twitter.

112
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,450
It might be how you style your home or
something happening in the workplace.

113
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,370
I want you to take a moment and think
about what is on trend or what's

114
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:21,050
trending where you live right now.

115
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,040
Try using it in a sentence and share
it with me in an example, below.

116
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,290
And now let's finish with our
final category. Eye-roll worthy.

117
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,240
This last set of expressions
is perfect when something is no

118
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,590
longer on trend,

119
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,300
it has become outdated when
something is no longer cool.

120
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,190
We might say that it specifically
belongs to a bygone era and we

121
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:50,540
start that with: That's
so.  That's so 2020.

122
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,970
That's so early two
thousands. That's so 1980s.

123
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,170
For example,

124
00:07:57,171 --> 00:08:01,610
I remember when I was a kid
in the 1980s and faded wash

125
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,120
jeans were so popular. Everyone had them.

126
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,720
And now when I see them,
I think, oh my gosh,

127
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,200
I would never wear those
it's so 1980s,.similarly,

128
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,930
if we've moved on from a trend,
everybody knows it's popular.

129
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,730
Everybody knows that people have been
talking about it and maybe you're

130
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:24,920
starting to feel a bit tired of it.

131
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,030
You could say that's so old news that's.

132
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:32,690
So yesterday or even that's ancient news,

133
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:37,549
everybody already knows about it.
That's ancient news. Here's an example.

134
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,730
The 2016 election is yesterday's news.

135
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,840
We've got to move on and talk about
the current events. And finally,

136
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:49,760
if we really want to express
our exasperations and the fact

137
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:54,020
that we are completely tired
of talking about something,

138
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:55,010
that was a,

139
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,900
then we can say I'm so over
that or I'm so over it,

140
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,990
I'm so done with that, for example,

141
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm so over reading about
feuds among the Royal family,

142
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,900
or I'm so done with hearing
about zoom fatigue on every

143
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:15,150
podcast right now, and with that,

144
00:09:15,151 --> 00:09:19,740
you have a plethora of ways to talk
about what's trending and what's

145
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,360
not in English.

146
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,370
And all of these are wonderful
alternatives to saying
that's so popular right

147
00:09:26,371 --> 00:09:30,180
now to finish. I want to challenge
you with a couple of questions.

148
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,000
I've already asked you to
share with me an example,

149
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:36,420
sentence of something that is
trending, where you live right now.

150
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,350
And now I've got two more
questions for you. Number one,

151
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,600
what are you so over right now? Or
what are you so done with right now?

152
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,590
What are you tired of talking
about? And number two,

153
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,640
is there something that is making
a splash where you live right now?

154
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,630
Maybe it's something happening at work,
something on Twitter or in the news.

155
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,170
Again, I want you to tell me
about it in an example, sentence,

156
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,060
using the expression to make
a splash or making a splash

157
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,500
as always, if you found this lesson
helpful to you, I would love to know.

158
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,990
And you can tell me in
one very simple way,

159
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,250
