1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:04,840
How do you strategically and effectively
learn phrasal verbs in English?

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,080
Like many of my students, you
might struggle with that question.

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,400
You may even feel overwhelmed by the
sheer number of phrasal verbs we have

4
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:16,640
in English, because there
are thousands of them.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,190
So where do you start and
how do you learn them in

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,110
a way that allows you to also remember
them easily so that you can use them

7
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,590
in conversations when you want,

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,460
If you don't already know, I'm

So you never miss one of these lessons.

19
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,520
And now let's get back to that question
of how do you strategically learn

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,640
phrasal verbs verbs in my
Confident English lesson today,

21
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:33,550
I'm going to answer that question
and help you get started.

22
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,110
The answer to strategic effective
practice is simple themes.

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,110
Learn new vocabulary, including
phrasal verbs in themes.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,470
There are two reasons why
themes are so effective.

25
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,860
Number one, when you
choose a theme to focus on,

26
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:58,540
you're likely to choose something that
you are either extremely interested in,

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,940
or it's an area of need.

28
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,220
It's a topic that you need to speak
to for work or in your daily life.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,793
As a result,

30
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,050
what you learn will be practical
and useful to your life.

31
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,450
The second reason themes are so
effective is that you are going to

32
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,810
encounter the same vocabulary
again and again and again,

33
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,810
as you study that theme.

34
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:29,169
And let me give you a clear example of
how that works with our focus today in

35
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,800
this lesson,

36
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,600
you're going to learn 26 must
have phrasal verbs in English

37
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,880
for travel. And let's talk
about this idea of repetition.

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,060
In this lesson,

39
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm going to introduce you to several
new phrasal verbs or maybe some

40
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,240
phrasal verbs you've learned before.

41
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,590
So you'll have the
opportunity to hear them.

42
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,870
You can even go to my website to
see this lesson online and read

43
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:56,704
them as well.

44
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:02,080
So you're getting that learning process
in conversations with coworkers or

45
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,160
neighbors about their past vacations
or their upcoming summer plans,

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,320
you'll have the opportunity to hear
those same phrasal verbs. Again,

47
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,960
in those conversations, you might spend
a little bit of time online this week,

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,070
reviewing some articles
about travel. For example,

49
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,070
how to plan your dream vacation,

50
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,830
or maybe the top 12 cities to
visit this year. In those articles,

51
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:29,590
you're likely to see some of the same
phrasal verbs that you're going to hear in

52
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,870
this lesson today. And then finally,

53
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,630
when you practice speaking with others,

54
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,860
and when you get to share
your travel experiences,

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,260
you have the opportunity to
use these same phrasal verbs.

56
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:47,300
This is the key to not just
learning phrasal verbs effectively,

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,460
but remembering them so that when
you hear them in conversations,

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,090
you immediately understand the
meaning and you can use them in your

59
00:03:56,091 --> 00:03:59,210
communication as well.
Now, with this theme today,

60
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,330
I've divided it into four subtopics.
So it's easier to stay focused.

61
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,530
We're going to look at phrasal verbs that
we typically use when we're booking or

62
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:12,250
planning a trip than a series
of phrasal verbs we use for

63
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:13,800
transportation.

64
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,000
Part three will be phrasal verbs that
we typically use at the airport and a

65
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,779
hotel.

66
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:24,000
And finally phrasal verbs that you're
likely to use or hear when you arrive at

67
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:26,920
your destination, before
we get into part one,

68
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,710
I want to spend a little bit of time
reviewing what exactly is a phrasal verb.

69
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,290
Now,

70
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,310
if you're crystal clear on this and you
have no questions about what phrasal

71
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:40,029
verbs are, I recommend that you
skip ahead to the next part,

72
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,390
where we begin with phrasal verbs
used in booking and planning a trip

73
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,110
I've made that easy to do by
splitting this video up into chapter.

74
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,300
So you can go on ahead
to the next section.

75
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,540
For those of you who want a quick review,

76
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,700
let's talk about what
exactly is a phrasal verb.

77
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,100
A phrasal verb is a standard
English verb combined

78
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:06,380
with an adverb or a
proposition, for example,

79
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,210
the phrasal verbs to get
away and to look forward

80
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,050
these two combine a standard
verb with an adverb.

81
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,210
Two more examples include to get
into and to dream of where we have

82
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,730
standard verbs combined with prepositions.

83
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,120
What makes phrasal verbs really
tricky is the fact that when we

84
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,760
combine the standard verb
with an adverb or preposition,

85
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,160
there's a whole new meaning to learn.

86
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,760
You are learning an entirely new verb.

87
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,720
You might be familiar with the verb,

88
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,160
look or familiar with the verb dream,

89
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,870
but the meaning of those
verbs when they are alone is

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,390
different from the meaning when they're
combined with an adverb or preposition.

91
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:57,720
And with that, let's
dive right into part one,

92
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,760
our first series of phrasal verbs when
you're booking or planning a trip.

93
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,080
One of the first phrasal verbs that
you're likely to hear is to get away,

94
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,240
to get away, means to leave
and go somewhere for a break
of vacation or holiday.

95
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,470
For example, in a conversation
with a friend, I might say,

96
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,190
you really need to get away
and recharge your batteries.

97
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:24,670
You've been working way too much lately.
And in response to that statement,

98
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,150
my friend might say,

99
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,390
I know I've been dreaming of going
to the beach to dream of something

100
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:36,620
means to think about or wish for
something that you really want.

101
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,380
Now, if you've been
dreaming of a long vacation,

102
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,060
you might need to sock away
for a while to sock away means

103
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,180
to put money into a bank account or to
invest it in some way so that you are

104
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,450
saving. For example,
in the past year alone,

105
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,450
he had socked away enough for
a two week trip to Portugal.

106
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,930
In addition to saving a bit of money,

107
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:05,970
you might also aim to rack
up points for free airfare.

108
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,690
This is something that
hotel chains, air airlines,

109
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,760
and credit card companies do quite a bit.

110
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,160
As you spend money on airline
travel or hotel stays,

111
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,080
you earn points over time,

112
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,280
or you can rack up points as you do that.

113
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:27,760
You'll be able to exchange them
for a few free nights of stay or

114
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,910
some cost savings on airfare. And
when you have enough of those points,

115
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,150
you might say I've racked up
enough points for a free trip,

116
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,750
socking away and racking up points
will certainly be important.

117
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,110
If you see prices hike up
to hike up means to increase

118
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,020
or raise the cost of
something. For example,

119
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,820
due to fuel and staff shortages
airlines have hiked up the cost

120
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,673
of airfare.

121
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,540
Before we continue with a few more
phrasal verbs we use when planning a trip,

122
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,260
I want to pause here and take a second.

123
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,170
Look at what we've learned so far.

124
00:08:08,171 --> 00:08:13,010
We've had the phrasal verbs to
get away. I need to get away.

125
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:17,810
I'm dreaming of he had socked up airlines

126
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,570
have hiked up.

127
00:08:19,571 --> 00:08:24,010
Do you notice that the way we
use phrasal verbs is exactly the

128
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,560
same as standard verbs. There are two
important things that we're doing.

129
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,960
Number one, to ensure accuracy,

130
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:36,960
we are changing the phrasal
verb according to its tense.

131
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:40,600
So you might see the phrasal verb in
the present past future. And so on.

132
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,110
The second thing to pay attention
to is that the phrasal verb

133
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,429
agrees with the subject. For example,

134
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,830
I can say I dream of going
to the beach and my husband

135
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,240
dreams of going to the mountains
as we continue to practice

136
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,520
today, keep these two things in mind.

137
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,559
And now let's continue with these phrasal
verbs. We need to plan for our trip.

138
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,760
Number six is to figure out
in those first moments of

139
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,280
planning where you're going next,

140
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,630
you might need to figure out where
you want to go to figure out means to

141
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:22,750
solve a problem, or to discover
the answer to a question.

142
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,870
If you're talking about
a past travel experience,

143
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,790
you could also use it in a sentence.

144
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,420
Like we figured out how to
explore Europe on a tight budget.

145
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,020
After you figured out
where you want to go,

146
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,059
you might need a little bit of help
deciding what to do when you're there.

147
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,380
And someone, you know,

148
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,540
or perhaps even a travel agent
might hook you up to hook someone

149
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,450
up with someone or to hook someone up with

150
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,410
something means to successfully
put someone into contact

151
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,970
with another person or to
successfully get someone,

152
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,650
something that they need.
Let me give you two examples.

153
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,240
Our travel agent hooked us up with
first class tickets home to the United

154
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,800
States. In this example,

155
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,880
the travel agent is helping us get
something we need or really want.

156
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,440
And the second example,

157
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,280
a friend of ours hooked us up
with an amazing travel guide.

158
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,240
We were able to explore the city,

159
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,630
learn its history and appreciate
its architecture. In this example,

160
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,990
a friend connected us with someone else.

161
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,870
Once you have a few of
those things in place,

162
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,590
I'm sure that you'll be
looking forward to your trip.

163
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,550
This means to positively anticipate
an event and for our final

164
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,540
phrasal verb in this category,

165
00:10:47,929 --> 00:10:52,580
it's the one phrasal verb that
we never want to hear to fall

166
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,140
through. If something falls
through, it means that it fails,

167
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,940
or it comes to nothing. For example,

168
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,809
our travel plans fall through
due to a family emergency.

169
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,330
Okay? Now it's time to move on to topic.
Number two, under the theme of travel,

170
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,730
we're going to look at a series of
phrasal verbs that we typically use when

171
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,290
using transportation.

172
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:22,410
The first one is to get into
what this means is to enter a

173
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,000
car. For example, we got into
the car and drove to the beach.

174
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,480
Now, if you're using public
transportation, for example,

175
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,559
a bus train or plane,

176
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:38,120
rather than get into you would
use the phrasal verb to get on.

177
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,640
For example, once the gates are closed,

178
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:44,270
you are no longer able
to get on the plane.

179
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:49,630
Now you might be wondering why
do we use get in for the car and

180
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,559
get on for public
transportation. Recently,

181
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,920
I did a lesson on
prepositions of place in,

182
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,720
on and at you'll discover the answer
to that question in that lesson.

183
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,000
So I'll share a link to it in
the notes below this video.

184
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:11,400
Now the opposite of getting on a
plane train or bus is to get off.

185
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,870
It means to exit. For example,

186
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:18,710
if you're flying to see some friends in
another city, you might say, oh my gosh,

187
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:23,590
we got off the plane hours ago, but we
were held up waiting for our luggage.

188
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,470
Do you notice in that example,

189
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,220
I used another phrasal
verb to hold up to hold up

190
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,940
means to be delayed.

191
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,740
So perhaps there was some mix up
with the luggage. And as a result,

192
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,220
you were delayed. You were held
up waiting for your luggage.

193
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,500
You could also use this
one talking about traffic.

194
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,260
If you are late getting to the airport,

195
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,890
you might have gotten held up in traffic.

196
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,210
And this leads me to
our next phrasal verb.

197
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,970
The reason that you may have been
delayed or held up in traffic

198
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,890
is because traffic was backed up.

199
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,410
This phrasal verb actually has two
possible meanings when we're talking about

200
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,440
using transportation. So when
you're on your way to the airport,

201
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,080
you may be late because
traffic was backed up.

202
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,280
The second meaning of to back up when
we're talking about transportation means

203
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,000
to go in reverse. For example,

204
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,960
let's say that you're on vacation with
your family and you decide to rent a

205
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:28,150
large van, which you're not
really comfortable driving.

206
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,750
So you might ask someone,
could you give me some help?

207
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,670
I'm trying to back up the van.

208
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,270
And now we have just three more phrasal
verbs that we typically use with

209
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:42,950
transportation. The
first one is to pick up,

210
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,900
this is a fantastic phrasal verb to know,

211
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,580
and it has so much
meaning to pick someone up

212
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,620
means to go somewhere,

213
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,020
to get someone and provide transportation.

214
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,800
For example,

215
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,690
you might be waiting for an
Uber to pick you up and take

216
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:04,524
you to the airport,

217
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,370
or you might drive to the airport to
pick up a friend who's coming to visit

218
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,050
you. If you go to the airport
to pick up your friend,

219
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:19,050
you're likely to pull up to
the passenger, pick up area,

220
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,560
to pull up to a specific area
means to stop your vehicle

221
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:26,920
in a certain place. So once again,

222
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:29,440
let's imagine you have a
friend coming to visit you.

223
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,800
You are driving to the airport to pick
her up and you know that she has already

224
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:39,360
arrived. She sent you a text message
to say, I've landed. I have my bags.

225
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,070
I'm waiting for you in
the passenger pickup area.

226
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:45,910
And you might call her to say,

227
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,070
I'll be there in just a few
moments I'm pulling up soon,

228
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,200
or I'll pull up to the passenger
pickup area in just one or two minutes,

229
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,320
the opposite of picking
someone up. So again,

230
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:04,120
going somewhere to get
someone is to drop someone

231
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,070
off.

232
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,550
This means to take someone
somewhere and leave them there.

233
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,590
So at the end of your
friend's trip, you might say,

234
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,030
I can drive you to the airport
to drop you off this afternoon.

235
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,950
Or if you're in a taxi on
the way to the airport,

236
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,470
you might tell your driver where
to drop you off. For example,

237
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:30,420
you can drop me off at the United
gate. Now, one more phrasal verb.

238
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:33,220
I want to share here. Doesn't
connect to transportation,

239
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,380
but it is part of this process of dropping
someone off or it's related to it.

240
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,220
We also have a phrasal verb to see off.

241
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,410
This means to be present in
a departure area and to say

242
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:48,490
goodbye to someone,

243
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:54,410
remember to drop someone off means to
take them to a location and leave them

244
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:54,910
there.

245
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,730
So you drop your friend off at the
airport and you drive away to see

246
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:04,010
someone off means that you take them
to the airport. You park the car,

247
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,880
you go inside the airport with them.
You wait in the departure area.

248
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,240
And at that last moment you say goodbye.

249
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,000
So you could tell your friend, I would
love to see you off at the airport.

250
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,760
I'll take you this afternoon.
And when you say that,

251
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,150
it's clear that you'll be going into
the airport with your friend and you'll

252
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:29,070
wait with her until her flight is ready.
Okay. We have two more sections to go.

253
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,750
I hope that you're writing down a few new
phrasal verbs and getting some example

254
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,390
sentences written down as well.

255
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,550
Our next section is quite short with
just four phrasal verbs that we typically

256
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,500
hear at the airport and at the hotel.

257
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,660
Number one to check in this means
to officially let someone know that

258
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:50,420
you've arrived for a reservation.

259
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,180
The first thing that you'll do at the
airport is to check in for your flight.

260
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,260
And after you arrive at your destination,

261
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,850
you might check into the hotel before
you go out to explore the city.

262
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:08,650
The perfect opposite to that is
when it's time to leave the hotel,

263
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,809
you check out this means to
leave a place for example, hotel,

264
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,960
and in the process of leaving you
return any keys and pay outstanding

265
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:19,983
fees.

266
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:24,240
The third phrase LA verb in this category
is to take off and we only use it with

267
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:24,829
an airplane.

268
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:29,520
It's not used in a hotel to take
off means to leave the ground.

269
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,600
For example, the plane takes off.

270
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,359
After all passengers have boarded
and the doors have been closed.

271
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:41,790
And the opposite of that is to touch
down the next time you're on a flight,

272
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,590
listen carefully to the pilot. If
the pilot is speaking in English,

273
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,750
you'll likely hear this phrasal verbs.

274
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,640
It means to descend the wheels on
a plane and land on the ground.

275
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,880
So in the last 20 or
30 minutes of a flight,

276
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,160
you might hear a flight attendant or a
pilot say we're going to touch down in

277
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:03,080
about 20 minutes. Okay?

278
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:07,760
It's time for our final
section of 26 must have

279
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,950
phrasal verbs for travel in English.

280
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,310
Section four includes four phrasal
verbs you're likely to hear or use

281
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,350
when you get to your destination.

282
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,869
The first one is to look around
and this means to explore what

283
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,260
is near you in an area. For
example, that first day in the city,

284
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,540
you might not have a lot of
plans. And you might ask someone,

285
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,700
do you wanna look around
for a place to eat,

286
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,940
or do you wanna spend the afternoon just
looking around as you look around the

287
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:40,380
city, you might also get around.

288
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,250
This means to go or travel
to different places.

289
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,530
When you tell someone
else about your vacation,

290
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:52,050
you might say we were able to get
around the city easily on foot,

291
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,330
or despite the gloomy rainy weather,

292
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:58,730
we were still able to get
around and explore the city.

293
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,359
The third phrasal verb in this section
is to head for, or head toward,

294
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,280
and this means to begin moving in
the direction of a certain place.

295
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,000
So let's say that on your
second day of your vacation,

296
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:15,520
you have plans to go to a museum
after breakfast in the morning,

297
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,119
you might say to your partner, are
you ready to head toward the museum?

298
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,830
Or you might even say, let's
head toward the museum,

299
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,630
but on the way there there's a coffee
shop. I'd love to try. And finally,

300
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,830
our last phrasal verb for today
is to head back after a day

301
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:34,150
of getting around the city,

302
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,350
exploring everything there is to see
you might be tired and feel ready to

303
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,820
head back to your hotel.

304
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:47,340
This means to begin
returning to a place you

305
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:51,380
started your morning at a hotel,
you went out and explored the city,

306
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,140
and now it's time to return back
to that place. And with that,

307
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,170
you have 26 must have phrasal
verbs in English for talking about

308
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:01,650
travel. Now,

309
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,650
if you practiced along with me and you
wrote down a few of your own example

310
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,930
sentences, I would love
to know what they are.

311
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:12,290
You can share with me in the comment
section below while you do that,

312
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:16,690
make sure that you also review the
example sentences that others have shared.

313
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,760
It's part of that process of repetition.

314
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:24,119
And it might give you a few ideas of
how you can use the phrasal verbs you've

315
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,680
learned today. If you found
today's lesson helpful to you,

316
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,280

lesson. Thank you so much for joining me.

318
