1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,192
Oh hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,640
Today's grammar lesson is an exciting one,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,644
we're gonna practise the grammar that you need to

4
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:12,595
accurately tell stories in English.

5
00:00:12,806 --> 00:00:16,267
We'll focus on two important past tenses,

6
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:20,341
the past continuous and the past perfect continuous.

7
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:24,149
Now what I really want to do is help you to understand

8
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:27,042
the difference between these two tenses,

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,000
when should you use the past continuous

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,538
and when should you use the past perfect continuous?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,310
That way we can help you to tell stories accurately and improve

12
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,030
your English grammar and as usual if you watch the lesson

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,142
through, I've got some questions to help you test your skills

14
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:47,742
and to practise what you learn during this lesson

15
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:49,529
which is super important.

16
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:50,798
So let's dive in!

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,697
So like I said, let's dive straight in.

18
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:01,649
Why do we use the past continuous?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,878
We use it to say that an action was in progress at a precise

20
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:10,422
moment in the past.

21
00:01:10,422 --> 00:01:14,160
What were you doing at 3pm on Friday?

22
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,069
I was washing my hair.

23
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:21,996
Now this tense is often used with the past simple tense 

24
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:27,069
to talk about two past actions that took place at the same time.

25
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,336
Like I washed my hair.

26
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,663
And the hot water ran out.

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,503
So the longer action goes in the past continuous tense and it's

28
00:01:37,644 --> 00:01:41,627
interrupted by the short action in the past simple.

29
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,785
I was washing my hair when the water ran out.

30
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:50,663
You're probably quite familiar with the structure of past continuous

31
00:01:50,663 --> 00:01:52,898
sentences in English, right?

32
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:58,616
In all continuous tenses, the auxiliary verb be is essential, right?

33
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:04,389
In the past continuous, our auxiliary verb be becomes

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,618
was or were depending on the subject.

35
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,701
I was running.

36
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:12,785
They were running.

37
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,089
Easy right?

38
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:19,447
Now let's compare that with the past perfect continuous.

39
00:02:19,447 --> 00:02:24,187
It's similar to the past continuous but rather than helping us

40
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:29,387
to show two actions taking place at the same time in the past,

41
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,654
we can use the past perfect continuous to show that 

42
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:38,723
one action was in progress before a second action started.

43
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:44,061
I had been doing the dishes when John arrived.

44
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:50,870
I was doing the dishes but I stopped doing them when John arrived

45
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,163
and I hadn't finished doing them yet.

46
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:57,754
Right that action is still incomplete

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,377
so when John leaves, I'll probably have to finish doing the dishes

48
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:05,525
right I'll go back to that action.

49
00:03:05,525 --> 00:03:09,386
Let's look at the structure for a minute because it's obviously

50
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:13,059
a little different from the past continuous sentence, isn't it?

51
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:16,903
The past perfect continuous sentence has

52
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:19,226
different auxiliary verbs.

53
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:21,139
Can you see them?

54
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:28,959
Had and being followed by our main verb in -ing form

55
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,791
which is common for all continuous tenses.

56
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,801
I had been doing the dishes.

57
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:39,040
They had been waiting for a long time.

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,003
She had been feeling unwell since lunchtime.

59
00:03:43,308 --> 00:03:47,105
And of course, for negative sentences, we just add not.

60
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:51,970
I had not been doing the dishes. I hadn't been doing the dishes.

61
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:55,993
I'm really just giving you a quick overview here because what we

62
00:03:55,993 --> 00:04:00,391
 really want to focus on today is when to use the past continuous

63
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:02,784
and when to use the past perfect continuous.

64
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,708
We want to focus on the difference.

65
00:04:04,872 --> 00:04:07,601
If you want to study and to practise a bit more

66
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:11,600
with the past perfect continuous tense, I've got a whole lesson

67
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,774
dedicated to it. It's right up there.

68
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:18,318
When it comes to grammar, I've got your back, don't I?

69
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,065
I have a whole grammar playlist so it's worth bookmarking it

70
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,644
so that you know where to find all of my grammar lessons

71
00:04:27,644 --> 00:04:29,815
when you need to practise, right?

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,225
So let's compare them!

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,385
Taken at face value, the past continuous

74
00:04:34,385 --> 00:04:38,564
and the past perfect continuous do seem pretty similar.

75
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,467
They both describe an ongoing or continuous action.

76
00:04:43,795 --> 00:04:48,000
They both describe actions that took place in the past

77
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:52,809
and they are both used a lot in combination with the simple past

78
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,067
but they aren't the same.

79
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:58,611
There are two main differences between the past continuous

80
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:00,456
and the past perfect continuous

81
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:02,196
that I want to share with you today.

82
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:06,778
And the first one is the order of the events in the past

83
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:08,672
in relation to each other.

84
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:12,978
The past continuous expresses an action in progress

85
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:15,391
at a particular moment in the past.

86
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,513
I was studying when the doorbell rang.

87
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:24,527
So let's say that these two actions happened yesterday at 3pm.

88
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:29,862
I was in the process of studying at that moment. At the same time,

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,238
the doorbell rang at 3pm yesterday.

90
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,887
I was studying when the doorbell rang.

91
00:05:37,988 --> 00:05:42,472
We use when to join these two actions. It shows us that the two

92
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:45,656
actions took place at the same time right

93
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:48,942
and the tenses give us information about

94
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:51,091
the nature of these actions.

95
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:55,600
Studying is a long action, it's a continuing action  

96
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,869
but the doorbell ringing is a short action, right?

97
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:04,467
Both actions happen at the same time but one action,

98
00:06:04,654 --> 00:06:07,584
the short one, interrupts the other one.

99
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:10,676
The difference with the past perfect continuous 

100
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:14,356
is that it expresses an action in progress

101
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:17,401
before a particular moment in the past.

102
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,421
I had been studying when you arrived.

103
00:06:21,608 --> 00:06:24,482
So here I spent some time studying

104
00:06:25,171 --> 00:06:30,000
and wasn't finished yet but later at some point the doorbell rang.

105
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:35,223
We can still use the conjunction when to join these actions 

106
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:38,858
but we can also use the conjunction before.

107
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:42,977
I had been studying before you arrived.

108
00:06:43,328 --> 00:06:47,301
Using when emphasises that the action was unfinished

109
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:49,725
when the second action takes place.

110
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,813
But using before emphasises that the first action started

111
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:58,342
at an earlier point in time than the second action.

112
00:06:58,553 --> 00:07:02,862
Okay, but what was I doing when the doorbell rang?

113
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:04,296
Was I studying?

114
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:06,724
Well actually, we don't know.

115
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:11,497
I might have been studying at that moment or I might not.

116
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:15,102
Whether or not I was studying at that moment when the doorbell

117
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:19,855
rang is not really important and this is a big difference

118
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:21,833
compared to the past continuous. 

119
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:27,429
What's important in this sentence is that the studying had started

120
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,695
and it wasn't finished yet.

121
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,795
So even if it wasn't necessarily in progress at the exact moment

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,051
that the shorter action happened, when the doorbell rang,

123
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:43,982
it's in progress, right? It isn't complete.

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay so listen up because what I'm about to tell you is really

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,886
important. The idea of an action in progress 

126
00:07:51,886 --> 00:07:56,138
in the past perfect continuous, it's a little bit abstract

127
00:07:56,138 --> 00:08:00,213
and by abstract, I mean that the progression of that action

128
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:04,843
can go on for many hours or days or even years.

129
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:09,504
So using this tense means that it isn't clear whether the action

130
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:13,686
was actually happening at that exact moment.

131
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:17,349
I'm going to give you one more example to show you what I mean.

132
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,407
Julia was cooking when the guests arrived.

133
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:26,449
Julia had been cooking for hours when the guests arrived.

134
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,932
So in this sentence Julia had to stop what she was doing

135
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:34,390
and go to the door and let her guests in right.

136
00:08:34,624 --> 00:08:38,148
The arrival of her guests interrupted her

137
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:40,474
and interrupted her cooking

138
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,450
but in this sentence here Julia has started cooking

139
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,804
probably long before the guests arrived.

140
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:50,134
The food wasn't ready when they did arrive.

141
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:52,831
The cooking was incomplete.

142
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:58,181
So whether or not she was actually in the process of cooking

143
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:02,692
when her guests arrived at the door doesn't really matter.

144
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:03,929
It's not important.

145
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:08,092
The fact is that the cooking wasn't complete

146
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,500
so they didn't have anything to eat

147
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,919
so that means that while the past continuous shows us

148
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,011
a long continuing action that is in progress

149
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:19,748
at a specific moment in the past,

150
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:24,441
the past perfect continuous shows us a long continuing action 

151
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:29,497
that isn't necessarily in progress at a specific moment in past.

152
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:34,151
But the consequence of that action has an impact

153
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:37,163
on that specific moment in the past.

154
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:40,425
The impact is that her guests are there 

155
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,472
but there's no food to eat. She hasn't finished right

156
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:47,385
so that is the impact on that particular moment.

157
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:49,314
Do you see the difference there?

158
00:09:49,314 --> 00:09:50,375
Excellent.

159
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,699
I'm going to come back to that point about the consequence

160
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,740
a little later on in this video but first, I want to point out that

161
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,693
when we're comparing the past continuous

162
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:05,080
and the past perfect continuous, it is really important

163
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,859
to pay attention to how we talk about time in our sentences.

164
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:13,073
If you are paying close attention, you might have noticed

165
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:17,272
something that I've used in the past perfect continuous sentences

166
00:10:17,272 --> 00:10:20,468
but not in the past continuous ones.

167
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,888
Julia was cooking when the telephone rang.

168
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:29,967
Julia had been cooking for several hours

169
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:33,844
but the meal still wasn't ready when her guests arrived.

170
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:36,110
So can you see what I'm talking about?

171
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:38,230
It's a time reference.

172
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:43,512
So in the past perfect continuous, we often specify a duration 

173
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:49,249
or a period of time of course, using our adverbs for and since,

174
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:52,138
very common in the perfect tenses.

175
00:10:52,138 --> 00:10:56,169
And we do this to really emphasise the duration or the length

176
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,543
of that action.

177
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:01,462
She had been studying since 7am.

178
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,929
Not: She was studying since 7am. That's incorrect.

179
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:10,270
They had been cooking for hours.

180
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,707
Not: They were cooking for hours.

181
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:17,081
If you want to reference time in the past continuous,

182
00:11:17,081 --> 00:11:19,447
you've got to be precise

183
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:23,375
because it's a tense that shows us an action in progress

184
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,425
at a specific moment in the past.

185
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:30,643
At 3pm last Wednesday, Julia was cooking.

186
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,679
It's really specific, right? Are you with me?

187
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:35,366
Great!

188
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,074
The other way that we can compare these tenses is when

189
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:43,174
we use them to express action and consequence.

190
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:47,041
So both the past continuous and the past perfect continuous

191
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,023
can be used to give some context

192
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:52,629
and express the result of an action.

193
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:57,778
So that means that one action informs the state of another action.

194
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,119
A past continuous action like it was raining

195
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:05,295
informs the state of a second action.

196
00:12:05,295 --> 00:12:09,719
We can say: It was raining so the ground was wet.

197
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:14,303
So the result of the rain, the consequence of the rain

198
00:12:14,303 --> 00:12:18,864
is that the ground was wet. Logical, right?

199
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,005
Why was the ground wet?

200
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,039
Because raindrops were falling from the sky at that exact moment

201
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:29,855
in time and they were making the ground wet.

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,036
Okay so what changes when we use

203
00:12:33,036 --> 00:12:35,903
the past perfect continuous then?

204
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,693
It had been raining so the ground was wet.

205
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,888
Is it still raining?

206
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,981
The rain has stopped but the consequence of the rain,

207
00:12:48,981 --> 00:12:52,371
the wet ground, that's important. That's explaining

208
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,535
why the ground was wet.

209
00:12:54,535 --> 00:12:56,492
I'll show you one more example.

210
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,813
She was working hard and the presentation was almost finished.

211
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,034
So the action

212
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,680
is all the hard work right it's an action and it's still ongoing,

213
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,518
it's still in progress.

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,807
The result of all of that hard work is that the presentation is almost

215
00:13:15,807 --> 00:13:18,629
finished but not quite.

216
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,697
Now compare it to: She had been working very hard

217
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:26,182
and the presentation was finally done.

218
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,000
So the action is the same, hard work

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,345
but this time the action is complete.

220
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,305
The work is finished right and the result of that completed work

221
00:13:39,703 --> 00:13:41,828
is that the presentation is done.

222
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,958
Okay now it's your turn to put all of this into practice.

223
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:50,466
We've got to get comfortable choosing between these tenses right

224
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:53,256
and deciding which is the right one to use.

225
00:13:53,256 --> 00:13:56,440
So you're going to choose between the past continuous

226
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,957
and the past perfect continuous.

227
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:00,589
I'm going to give you a sentence. 

228
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,748
You'll see a verb that you need to use in brackets

229
00:14:03,748 --> 00:14:07,460
but you'll need to put it in the right tense, all right?

230
00:14:07,624 --> 00:14:11,548
Here's a tip. Make sure you're looking out for those time references

231
00:14:11,548 --> 00:14:13,110
and those adverbs.

232
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,378
They're going to help you to choose the right tense.

233
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:19,344
I think they're a good clue.

234
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,534
Write down your answers on a piece of paper or in the comments.

235
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:39,481
You can check your answers by having a look at the description

236
00:14:39,481 --> 00:14:42,224
below. I've left the correct answers there.

237
00:14:42,224 --> 00:14:46,292
So a huge shout out to all of you who made it through this lesson.

238
00:14:46,292 --> 00:14:50,106
I know that it's really hard to stay focused with grammar.

239
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,942
Hopefully, you're feeling confident about using these tenses

240
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:59,711
and the good news is that there's some more practice coming

241
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:03,524
over the next couple of weeks. I'm going to be sharing a quiz

242
00:15:03,524 --> 00:15:07,106
and some speaking practice that will help you to review these

243
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:10,105
tenses and help you to use them in context

244
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,680
and get comfortable with them.
