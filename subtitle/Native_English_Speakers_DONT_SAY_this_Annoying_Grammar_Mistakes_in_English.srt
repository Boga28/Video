1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
hey guys welcome to lingua marina today

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,679
we're going to talk about things that

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,279
native speakers don't say and you

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,360
might say them and i might say them just

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,440
because they sound natural in our

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,759
language and they are okay in our native

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,160
language and so what we do we translate

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,800
them from our language into english and

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
they make either no sense to native

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,439
speakers or they just sound wrong in

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,199
order to avoid this problem you need to

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
learn how to think in english but that's

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,119
a different topic for a different video

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,960
today i'm just gonna highlight things

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,558
that you should pay attention to because

16
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,440
you might have been using them in a

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,840
wrong way let's dive into those things

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,079
first of all there are some nouns in

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,960
english that don't have plural form but

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,520
they mean a lot of things let me go back

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,600
a little bit there are some nouns that

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,520
are regular and they have regular plural

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
forms like battery

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
many batteries

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,160
or remote control a lot of remote

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,199
controls iphone iphones microphone

27
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,600
microphones cat cats like easy right but

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,559
there are some nouns that are

29
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,799
uncountable pretty easy as well milk

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,400
information water evidence that's okay

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,799
like we understand that information

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,040
means a lot of different pieces of data

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,840
and you can't really count information

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,000
you can't really count milk and it's

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,759
pretty obvious because when we talk

36
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,840
about water you can just say one two

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,479
three water you need glasses of water or

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,159
you need bottles of water and this is

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,759
what you can count but there are some

40
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,280
trickier nouns like for example fruit

41
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,600
you think i can count fruit if i have

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,520
five apples that should probably mean

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,360
five fruits and this is what happens in

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,680
my own language in russian we have a

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,720
plural for fruit and we say fruits well

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,040
we say fructi in russian anyways and let

47
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
me give you some other examples and the

48
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,200
only way out here is to memorize them

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,119
furniture rain homework research

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,640
equipment evidence luggage money

51
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,439
information work wine and there are

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,240
other words as well so the only way out

53
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
learn them remember that they don't have

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,079
a plural form let me give you some

55
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,878
examples they drank a lot of wine last

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,878
night i drink a lot of wine they had a

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,800
huge amount of evidence to prove his

58
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,560
alibi we need a massive amount of

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
evidence before making that leap not

60
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
much research was done on this matter

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,200
i've done some research the next mistake

62
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,920
that we make is using the wrong order of

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
adjectives in a sentence just listen

64
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,959
i am wearing a checkered cotton blouse i

65
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,000
am wearing a cotton checkered blouse

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
basically both of these sentences are

67
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,040
correct but the second sounds a little

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,680
like ah and you're like it doesn't sound

69
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,959
natural because

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,120
normally you would say checkered cotton

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,040
it's just again another thing that you

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,239
need to remember because every adjective

73
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
has its own place in a sentence in case

74
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
you have a lot of adjectives so the

75
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,400
first one would be opinion unusual

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,560
lovely or beautiful for example the

77
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
second would be size big small tall the

78
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,120
third will be physical quality thin

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,319
rough untidy the fourth would be shape

80
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,040
round square rectangular the fifth will

81
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,319
be age

82
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,120
young old youthful the sixth will be

83
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,560
color blue red pink or as in my case

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
checkered oh by the way checkered is

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
basically what you see

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,879
the seventh origin dutch japanese

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,920
turkish number eight material metal wood

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,879
plastic or cotton and you see it comes

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,040
later so it's checkered cotton not

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
cotton checkered

91
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,519
type general purpose four-sided u-shape

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,400
tent purpose cleaning hammering cooking

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,080
again this might sound too complicated

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
but the more you practice you just i've

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,920
never learned this this is the first

96
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,840
time i see it and if you show it to the

97
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
most native speakers they'll be like

98
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,080
what what are you showing me i've never

99
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,560
seen this table before this is the first

100
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,239
time i see it when making this video but

101
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,080
the thing is because i listen to the

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,319
language every single day i read a lot

103
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,200
in the language yes cotton checkered

104
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
sounds a little weird to me and i would

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
say checkered cotton so just develop

106
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,920
your inner ear to hear those things by

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
the way if you're looking for courses to

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,519
take in english and you're looking for

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,279
ways to surround you with the english

110
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,279
language my company and i my company is

111
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,519
language trip.com we have created a

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,440
course called intermediate to advanced

113
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,440
so this is basically for people who are

114
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,479
stuck

115
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,040
on their intermediate level and who want

116
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,800
this next step who want to surround

117
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,120
themselves with english to start feeling

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,199
those things to start understanding that

119
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
something sounds off something doesn't

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
sound right this course is full of

other amazing teachers but the most

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
amazing thing about this course is that

but every day is interactive every day

136
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,840
you have something new you would need

137
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,000
around 30 minutes a day maybe an hour a

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
day to be fully present in the course to

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,240

140
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,240
but interacting with studybuddy you can

code use it to get a discount and this

158
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,000
has been one of my favorite courses this

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,919
has been one of the favorite courses by

160
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,000
our students because over 10 000

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,240
students have already taken this course

162
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
and i'm super excited that we're adding

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
this interactive feature to it where you

164
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,240
can actually find a study buddy so the

165
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,919
link is down below i'm looking forward

166
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,240
to seeing you in our next cohort of

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
intermediate to advanced in 30 days

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,199
course the next mistake that we make is

169
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,080
agreeing with negatives so when you say

170
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
i didn't really like the restaurant as a

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
russian i am urged to say me too i

172
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,680
didn't like the restaurant as well right

173
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,039
but this is wrong

174
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:35,039
when you're agreeing with the negative

175
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,440
sentence you have to say me neither i

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,759
didn't like the restaurant me neither me

177
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,000
neither or another phrase i could use

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,319
neither did i neither did i so if

179
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,880
somebody says i don't like the sound

180
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,840
don't say me too say me neither or

181
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
neither do i a lot of people in the us

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,319
would also ask you do you mind if i sit

183
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,120
here and the correct answer here would

184
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,479
be no no i don't mind but again as a

185
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
russian as a foreigner i'm always

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,560
tempted to say yes like do you mind if i

187
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,039
sit here oh yes yes because what i mean

188
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,520
by this is yes yes please sit down so

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,319
ideally you just say the right word and

190
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,639
it's no do you mind if i sit here no i

191
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,759
don't mind

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,599
but if you're urged to say yes and if

193
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,280
you said yes and you realized you made

194
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,199
this mistake it happens to me all the

195
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,039
time somebody says do you mind if i use

196
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,919
your computer and i say yes and be like

197
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,319
so you do mine anyway yes yes please use

198
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,560
my computer so just add this second

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,880
sentence to clarify what you mean but

200
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,199
just remember that when somebody asks

201
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,599
you do you mind if you don't mind that

202
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
you say no i don't mind please use my

203
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,520
computer no i don't mind please sit at

204
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,840
the table no i don't mind please

205
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
subscribe to this channel and like this

206
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,240
video now let's look at the sentence i

207
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,599
want to go to usa first there is an

208
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,240
obvious mistake for me at least usa is

209
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,080
always used with the the usa because usa

210
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,479
is an acronym and it stands for the

211
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,879
united states of america so we have

212
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,639
states here the united states of america

213
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,199
the united arab emirates so whenever

214
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,319
it's a

215
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
complicated structure to describe one

216
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,199
country we use the the united kingdom

217
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,360
but canada australia all countries that

218
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,440
just have their name they don't require

219
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,599
the with my country russia for example

220
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
you can say russia and then you don't

221
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,360
need the but you can also say the

222
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
russian federation and once you have

223
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,958
this federation then you have your the

224
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,479
and this rule applies not only to

225
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,399
countries but also for instance to

226
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,399
mountains and mountain ranges for

227
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,039
example with names like everest elbrus

228
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,279
we don't use any article but if we're

229
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,440
talking about the alps this is actually

230
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
a mountain range and we use that and

231
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,839
another thing i wanted to note about

232
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,120
this sentence it's not actually a

233
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,519
mistake but a lot of people would say i

234
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,040
live in the us nobody really says usa i

235
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
live in the states is another way to say

236
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,880
it uh but i haven't heard a lot of

237
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,440
people use the usa you see these are

238
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,240
small things that you learn either from

239
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,240
this video or by practicing english

240
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,080
every single day or listening to

241
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,800
audiobooks watching netflix shows taking

242
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,440
intermediate to advanced in 30 days

243
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
language course with a link down below

244
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
and using my promo code this is the only

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,839
way to kind of memorize those things

246
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,519
because i don't really expect you to

247
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,839
print out this table with how you should

248
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,680
position adjectives in your sentence

249
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,920
like who who does that yes i would print

250
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,600
it out and i would just look at it from

251
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,200
time to time when i have a question but

252
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,480
i wouldn't really memorize which

253
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,640
adjective comes after which thank you

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,080
