1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:01,668
It all started in elementary school.

2
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,336
Nope, not in kindergarten.

3
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,003
This Mary Jane

4
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:06,131
here did not know a word of English.

5
00:00:06,464 --> 00:00:06,840
I was 7

6
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,466
in my second year of elementary school

7
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,884
when we started to have one hour

8
00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,511
English class per week.

9
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,345
This is when I learned

10
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,888
the English alphabet

11
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,023
Here I learned how to say How are you?

12
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,065
My name is Maria.

13
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:28,903
I learned to count in English 123456.

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,113
We learned how to put together

15
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,449
a sentence: subject verb object.

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,450
We learned pronouns.

17
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,076
I you, she me

18
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,496
us the verb to be to have the main verbs

19
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:38,830
in general.

20
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,957
There is/There are, prepositions of time.

21
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:45,253
Preposition of place:

22
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,132
This all continued

23
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,091
in middle school,

24
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,468
which is between eleven

25
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,927
and 14 years old in Italy.

26
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,305
The lessons were themed and followed

27
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,182
the structure of the textbook.

28
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,725
So each lesson would be something like,

29
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,947
I remember in middle

30
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,407
school we might have been 12

31
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,076
this native English speaker

32
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,202
came to our class

33
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,661
to do English conversation.

34
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:19,871
He was a 20 year

35
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,372
old, long haired,

36
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,708
huge Australian rugby player

37
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,085
who came to play this season

38
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,836
with the rugby team of Udinese

39
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,712
and probably thought

40
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,547
about making some side money.

41
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,381
At this point

42
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,674
most of the English tests

43
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,802
we were doing where written.

44
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,553
They were things like fill up

45
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,012
the blanks

46
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,139
and rearrange this group of words

47
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,516
to form a correct sentence.

48
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:39,808
We would

49
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,851
sometimes read out loud

50
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,394
from the textbooks in the class,

51
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,647
but we would really never speak English.

52
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,315
So I don't remember speaking English

53
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,608
with this guy that day.

54
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,192
At this point

55
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,903
all we could say was really,

56
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,657
I don't think we could understand him

57
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:56,616
either.

58
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,075
In fact,

59
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,535
we were never taught English

60
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,620
pronunciation in school.

61
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,329
Neither was it

62
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,414
taught to my English teachers.

63
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:05,166
Almost all the English we would hear

64
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,794
was from an Italian adult who had been

65
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,337
probably once

66
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,923
in an English speaking country.

67
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,049
But let's go on with high school,

68
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,509
which is more interesting.

69
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,636
In Italy high school's

70
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,680
from 14 to 19 years old.

71
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,974
Here my English teacher was a very strict

72
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,310
and rigid, Friulan, mature lady, in love

73
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,021
with the British culture and literature.

74
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:27,856
In fact,

75
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,858
she also had a good British

76
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,276
pronunciation herself.

77
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,319
Problem is that she never thought about

78
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,321
teaching it to us.

79
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:35,864
At this point,

80
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,782
we had two or three hours

81
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,409
per week of English lessons,

82
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,036
and they were taught in Italian.

83
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:43,621
In particular,

84
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,081
these lessons were divided into two

85
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,042
types either grammar or literature.

86
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,128
The grammar lessons became more detailed

87
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:50,920
and specific.

88
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,796
Plenty of time

89
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,714
was spent in learning

90
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:53,756
to capitalize all the

91
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,717
I pronouns, all the names of the months,

92
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:56,718
the nationalities, titles.  

93
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,552
plenty of time

94
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,386
to learn the past

95
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,179
simple and past

96
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,723
participle of the irregular verbs.

97
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,016
My teacher in particular

98
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,058
had a little obsession

99
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,227
with present perfect and past perfect.

100
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,771
Forms like I have done, I had done.

101
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,231
If you hear me overusing them,

102
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,232
now you know why.

103
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,525
We also thoroughly studied

104
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,195
the continuous forms of the past tenses

105
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,905
like I was doing. I have been doing.

106
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,364
I had been doing, not to mention

107
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,325
all the various future forms

108
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,618
like I will have done

109
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,037
or I will have been doing.

110
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,038
But in high school,

111
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,373
probably more than half of the hours

112
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,958
spent of English classes

113
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,336
where English literature and culture,

114
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,297
where English means from England.

115
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:34,714
When I say

116
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,591
literature, I mean mostly stuff

117
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,593
like Chaucer and Shakespeare,

118
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,594
which is not exactly

119
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,638
the most useful literature to understand

120
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,097
modern spoken English.

121
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,307
And of course, all these lessons

122
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,059
were taught in Italian.

123
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,434
By the way,

124
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,435
my English teacher

125
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,978
was a fantastic teacher,

126
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,688
despite a little bit rigid.

127
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,649
She just never spoke English to us.

128
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:53,233
For sure

129
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:53,816
to my spoken

130
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:54,484
English by far

131
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,818
the most educating experience

132
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:56,945
has been two weeks

133
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,029
cultural exchange

134
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,364
my class has done

135
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,907
with a Dutch school class.

136
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,784
We student hosted Dutch students

137
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,118
in our families for a week

138
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,578
and they did the same with us

139
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,330
for another week in the Netherlands.

140
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,081
Two weeks of that

141
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,540
had pretty much the same effect

142
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,124
on my oral

143
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,167
communication skills

144
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,877
as several years of lessons

145
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,379
in the classroom.

146
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,298
This is Mary Jane at 19 on her last day

147
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,216
of what we call

148
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:18,800
"scuola" (school before univeristy).

149
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,591
As you can understand

150
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:20,550
from the Serbo-Croatian

151
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,427
text on our shirt,

152
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,220
she was surrounded

153
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,471
by many foreign languages,

154
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,348
but could really speak none .

155
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:25,848
At this point

156
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,558
we all had been studying English

157
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,435
in school for twelve years.

158
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,354
We could write it very correctly,

159
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,981
although with a limited vocabulary,

160
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,941
we could read it easily.

161
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,985
If we had a dictionary available.

162
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,821
We could speak it very, very little.

163
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,075
In my case, everything

164
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,785
changed in my third year of university

165
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,661
when I participated

166
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,329
to the Erasmus program,

167
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,664
which is a European program

168
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,206
that allows you

169
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,124
to study abroad

170
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,501
for a semester or two semesters.

171
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,003
So I ended up living in Germany

172
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,545
for a year.

173
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,212
During this year,

174
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,339
I very much focused on learning German,

175
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,882
but if you are a student abroad

176
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:00,717
you are in contact

177
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,926
with other foreign students,

178
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:02,552
so you will end up

179
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,053
speaking English anyways.

180
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,096
After this experience,

181
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,348
I started traveling pretty often.

182
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,975
I also had international friends,

183
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,643
so I started using English

184
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,936
on a regular basis.

185
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,271
After I finished university,

186
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,231
I also discovered YouTube

187
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,941
and I started watching YouTube

188
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,026
both in Italian,

189
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,819
but especially in English.

190
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,030
And this is really where my understanding

191
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,656
of English skyrocketed.

192
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:25,867
At this point my speaking

193
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,368
skills were very good.

194
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,828
But I had always spoken

195
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,163
with other foreign people,

196
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,122
never with natives,

197
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,915
so my pronunciation

198
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,084
was still very uncertain.

199
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,587
I just dropped off my luggage.

200
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm here in the Greenwich Village

201
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,303
after spending three days in Midtown.

202
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,389
The real reason why I am so fluent in

203
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,432
English nowadays

204
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,477
is because I focused on my pronunciation.

205
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,936
How did I do that?

206
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:54,395
Well,

207
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,772
there was no course

208
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,398
of English pronunciation at the time.

209
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,858
No textbooks, no nothing.

210
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,651
But I really, really needed it

211
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,486
because in the meantime,

212
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,570
I started my YouTube channel.

213
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,446
and it was in English,

214
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,531
and so I needed to be as fluent

215
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,450
as possible to get decent views.

216
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,369
So I simply started analyzing

217
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,245
as much as I could listening

218
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,206
to other native speakers speaking.

219
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,083
I was helping myself with YouTube

220
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,001
and with real people

221
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,710
because in the meantime,

222
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,878
I started traveling here

223
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,587
to New York City,

224
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,714
being in contact with Americans.

225
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,966
This was a pretty long process.

226
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,259
And really, it's

227
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,803
all documented on my channel

228
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,429
because my channel is turning

229
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,098
four years this month

230
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:30,932
and you can really see

231
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,434
from my first video to the other ones

232
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,727
ttill the last ones,

233
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,604
how my spoken English developed.

234
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,064
This is why I proceeded

235
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,024
to create my English

236
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,776
pronunciation course for Italians,

237
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,194
because the pronunciation

238
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,321
is such a crucial part of the language.

239
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,531
And in Italy,

240
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,449
nobody really teaches it to us.

241
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,700
So I basically collected

242
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,701
all my knowledge

243
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,953
that I learned in years

244
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,955
of analyzing native speakers

245
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,956
and condensed it

246
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,416
into a video course

247
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,377
that I then put on sale on my website.

248
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,421
I do not do sponsorships on this channel,

249
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,714
but I do promote my products.

250
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,425
So this is my product

251
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,717
that if you are Italian,

252
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,803
you want to improve your English,

253
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,305
you can buy directly on my website.

254
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,099
My journey to become fluent in English,

255
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,184
starting from a normal Italian public

256
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:15,935
school education

257
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,437
has been very long,

258
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,896
but for sure it could have been

259
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,856
way shorter

260
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,399
if only someone taught me

261
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,192
a little bit of pronunciation.

262
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,236
My next video is going to be next Sunday.

263
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:25,945
