♪ Many nights we've prayed 

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,875
With no proof anyone could hear

4
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,954
In our hearts a hopeful song

5
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:27,632
We barely understood

6
00:00:27,632 --> 00:00:31,571
Now, we are not afraid

7
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:35,933
Although we know there's much to fear

8
00:00:35,933 --> 00:00:38,931
We were moving mountains

9
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:43,931
Long before we knew we could

You will when you believe

15
00:01:30,472 --> 00:01:33,887
In this time of fear

16
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:37,811
When prayer so often proves in vain

17
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:41,751
Hope seems like the summer birds

18
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:45,454
Too swiftly flown away

19
00:01:45,454 --> 00:01:49,411
Yet now I'm standing here

20
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:53,351
My heart's so full, I can't explain

21
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:57,189
Seeking faith and speaking words

You will when you believe

They don't always happen when you ask

And it's easy to give in to your fears

30
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:05,284
