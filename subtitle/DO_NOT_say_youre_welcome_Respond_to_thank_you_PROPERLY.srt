1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,703
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,380
- Hello, everyone, and welcome
back to English With Lucy.

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:17,720
Today, I am going to be teaching you

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,360
all of the ways that you
can respond to thank you.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,460
Now you're welcome or you are welcome

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,970
is a perfectly valid way
to respond to a thank you.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,600
But I think it's a little bit overused,

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,020
especially by learners of English.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:34,990
It's completely natural.

10
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:37,010
You find one way you like to say things

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:40,450
and then you say it again,
and again, and again.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,900
The purpose of this video is
to expand your vocabulary bank,

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,760
so that you have many more
options when somebody thanks you.

14
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
So this video is going to be perfect

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,670
for improving your vocabulary.

16
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,480
But if you want to improve your listening

17
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,770
and your pronunciation even further,

18
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,520
than I highly recommend
listening to audio books.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,570
It's something I mention
in a lot of my videos,

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,810
but I mention it a lot
because I know it works.

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,720
I advise you to take a
book that you already have,

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,840
a book that you've maybe already read

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,250
and download the audio version

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,830
and listen to it whilst you are reading.

25
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,280
Just reading alone will not
help you with your pronunciation

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,010
because English is not
a phonetic language.

27
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,830
If you are hearing the
word as you read it,

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,990
your brain will make the connection,

29
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,540
and next time you see that word,

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,350
you will know how to pronounce it.

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,250
And next time you hear that word,

32
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,670
you will know how it's spelt.

33
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,630
You can get a free audiobook,
that's a 30 day free trial

34
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,760
of audible by clicking on the
link in the description box.

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,970
I've got loads of recommendations
for great audio books,

36
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,200
and also the physical book
counterpart on Amazon.

37
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,700
I really encourage you
to try out this method

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,810
because it could transform
your pronunciation,

39
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,590
your spelling, your vocabulary
and you're listening.

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,980
Right, let's get started with the lesson.

41
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,450
Let's begin with informal
or casual phrases

42
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,900
that you can use with
your friends and family.

43
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,260
The first one is, you're welcome.

44
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,550
But let's expand on that a little bit.

45
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,140
If you really want to emphasise

46
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,080
that their thanks has been
taken into consideration,

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,720
you can say, you're very welcome.

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
This is quite a British one, I think,

49
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,790
for example, thank you so much

50
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,180
for packing my shopping for me.

51
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,690
Oh, you're very welcome.

52
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,380
Number two, this one is
slightly more American.

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,500
It's, no problem,

54
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,870
no problem.

55
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,070
Bear in mind that the older generation

56
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,300
seem to dislike this one.

57
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,460
So keep that in your head

58
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,110
if a slightly older
person is thanking you.

59
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,880
An example, thanks for the help today.

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,220
No problem, I enjoyed helping you.

61
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,420
Number three, the third
way to respond to thank you

62
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,300
is, thank you. (laughs)

63
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,700
But this one is all about the emphasis.

64
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,690
If somebody thanks you but you think

65
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,770
that they should be thanked,
you can say, no, thank you.

66
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,370
Or just, thank you.

67
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,230
For example, thanks for
accepting the invitation.

68
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,730
Thank you.

69
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,610
I'm emphasising that really,
I should be thanking them

70
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,640
because they invited me somewhere.

71
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,800
Number four, this one is much more formal.

72
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,640
If we say it in its entire form
it's, the pleasure is mine.

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,210
The pleasure is mine.

74
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,650
You can also shorten it
to make it less formal

75
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,270
by saying, my pleasure,
or simply, pleasure,

76
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,080
that's very casual.

77
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,930
For example, thanks for
taking the parcel in for me.

78
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,780
Pleasure.

79
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,260
That's a short way of
saying it was my pleasure,

80
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,780
or the pleasure is mine, or was mine.

81
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,580
Number five is a very friendly one.

82
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,330
Only use this with people you know well.

83
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,640
It's, I know you'd do the same for me.

84
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,700
For example, I'd like to thank you

85
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,880
for looking after my cat so well.

86
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,780
The response, I know
you'd do the same for me.

87
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,990
I know you'd look after my
cat, so I looked after yours.

88
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,730
Even Stevens.

89
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:05,270
Number six is much more casual.

90
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,870
And it's slightly less heartfelt.

91
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,630
You might say this if
you don't really care,

92
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,770
or if somebody is thanking
you for doing something

93
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,260
that you might not have wanted to do.

94
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,990
But depending on the intonation
and the tone of voice,

95
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,410
it can also be quite warm.

96
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,540
It's, that's all right.

97
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,950
So I could say, thank
you for picking me up

98
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,080
from the station.

99
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,450
I could say either, that's all right.

100
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,390
Or, that's all right.

101
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,880
My tone of voice is telling you

102
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,950
everything you need to know there.

103
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,120
Number seven is a very casual one.

104
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,030
It's, no worries, no worries.

105
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,460
In use, thanks for letting me know

106
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,800
that my car alarm was going off.

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,140
No worries, I thought I'd better tell you.

108
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,930
The next one is very British.

109
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,060
It's quite self-deprecating.

110
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,450
It's, don't mention it.

111
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,720
For example, thank you so
much for bringing the desert.

112
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,670
Oh, don't mention it.

113
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,020
It was a lot of effort to
bring dessert probably.

114
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,820
And they probably do
want you to mention it,

115
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,450
but we just say, don't mention it

116
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,360
because, oh, it was nothing.

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,490
Number nine is very heartfelt.

118
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,610
It is, it was the least I could do.

119
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,800
For example, thank you for
visiting me in hospital.

120
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,480
Oh, it was the least I could do.

121
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,690
Again, very British,
very self-deprecating.

122
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,630
Number 10 is quite casual.

123
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,550
It's, anytime.

124
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,200
Thank you for stopping by, oh, anytime.

125
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,490
It's quite a generous
response, I like this one.

126
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,290
Number 11 is a really American one.

127
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,410
I hardly ever hear it used in the UK.

128
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,360
But I thought I should teach it to you

129
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,960
because British English
is not the only English,

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,810
it's good to know about all of
the different slang phrases.

131
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,173
And yes, this is a very
casual one, it is, sure.

132
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,810
A one word answer to say you're welcome.

133
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,160
Thank you for thinking of me, sure.

134
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,740
It often goes hand in
hand with no problem.

135
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,070
Sure, no problem.

136
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,010
Number 12 is, oh, it was nothing.

137
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,240
Again, another self-deprecating one.

138
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
It's a way of saying that
what they are thanking you for

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,840
was no extra effort.

140
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,870
Thank you for picking
my kids up from school.

141
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,930
Oh, it was nothing, my kids
already needed picking up.

142
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,670
No extra effort here.

143
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,380
Now I want to talk to you about four

144
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,240
more formal ways of
responding to thank you.

145
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,760
And these are more likely to
be used in business situations,

146
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,880
or maybe in a shop or restaurant.

147
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,810
Number one is very British,
it's quite old fashioned,

148
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,490
and it is, much obliged.

149
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:39,030
The full formal way of saying it is,

150
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,893
I'm very much obliged to you.

151
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,430
For example, thank you so much doctor,

152
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,350
I'm very much obliged to you.

153
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,780
This is shortened down to, I
actually experienced this one

154
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,760
in use the other day at a shoe shop.

155
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,730
I said, thank you so much after paying

156
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,500
and he said, "Much obliged."

157
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,810
And I thought, oh, I haven't
heard that phrase in a while,

158
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,610
I'm gonna put it in a video.

159
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,030
The guy had an amazing
Cockney accent as well,

160
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,230
he was really nice, really helpful.

161
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,990
Great shoes, they had a gel bottom.

162
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,510
Number two is a more formal
way of saying you're welcome

163
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,240
it is, you're most welcome.

164
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,290
Now, this does sound very posh.

165
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,220
So I wouldn't use it willy-nilly,

166
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,750
willy-nilly means without
careful thought, or planning.

167
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,380
I wouldn't use it willy-nilly.

168
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,260
But if you're in a formal situation,

169
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,280
for example, I thanked my solicitor

170
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,860
on the phone the other day
for sending me some forms.

171
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,920
And she replied with, you're most welcome

172
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,470
because she's quite a formal person,

173
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,230
and it was a formal legal situation.

174
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,840
Number three is, we
appreciate your business

175
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,350
or we appreciate your custom.

176
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,910
Custom if you're talking to a customer

177
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,300
and business if you're
talking to a business client.

178
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,540
For example, thank you for
sending the sample so promptly.

179
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,010
We appreciate your business.

180
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,740
And the last one,
definitely a business one,

181
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,810
it's, I'm happy to help.

182
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,610
For example, thank you for
helping me carry the coffees

183
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,700
to the office.

184
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,160
Oh, I'm happy to help.

185
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,240
Right, that's it for today's lesson.

186
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,240
I hope you enjoyed it and I
hope you learned something.

187
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,670
Again, really consider starting
to listen to audiobooks,

188
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,360

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,980

in the description box.

190
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,590
Don't forget to connect with
me on all of my social media.

191
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,820
I've got my Facebook,
I've got my Instagram

192
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,510
and I've got my twitter.

193
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,855
And I shall see you
soon for another lesson.

194
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,688
Muah!

195
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:30,776
