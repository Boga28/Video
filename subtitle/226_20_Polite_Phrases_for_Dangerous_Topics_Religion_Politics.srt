00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
Vanessa:
I'm so glad that  

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,260
that president won the election. He is going to 
change our country and make it a better place.  

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:14,040
What? Are you kidding? That president is terrible. 
He is going to completely ruin our country. Oh,  

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,000
no. Have you ever been in a situation like this 
where there is a controversial heavy topic? You  

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,100
want to express your opinion, but you want to 
say it politely, but you don't want to just  

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:33,960
stay silent? What can you say? Hi, I'm Vanessa

Before we get started with these controversial  

12
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:11,040
phrases, I want to give a little disclaimer. I 
wanted to add some controversial phrases to these  

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,980
polite expressions so that you could see how they 
might be used in a conversation. Not all of these  

14
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:24,420
controversial expressions are my opinion, but I 
wanted to give them as an example, because you  

15
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,720
will probably hear this in real conversations, 
whether it's with your family members, with your  

16
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,720
friends, with your English speaking friends. I'm 
sure you'll hear them so I want to give you lots  

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,300
of examples. So please take the examples with 
a grain of salt. This means don't take them  

18
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:47,700
seriously, but do learn the polite expressions. 
All right, let's get started with the first one. 

19
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:55,860
First, polite controversial expression is, "This 
is just my opinion, but Americans are really rude  

20
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,980
when they travel." So you are starting this off 
by letting them know, this is just my opinion,  

21
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:08,100
but you still want to share your opinion, right? 
"This is just my opinion, but," great phrase.  

22
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:15,720
Let's go to the next one. "I'm not an expert, 
but I'd rather be a woman now than in any other  

23
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,340
time in history." Sometimes I've been talking 
with someone who says, "I don't even want to  

24
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,900
have children. The world is so terrible today. 
What if I had a girl? It would be so terrible  

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,980
for her." Well, what if you said, "You know what? 
I'm not an expert, but I'd rather be a woman now  

26
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,640
than in any other time in history. In the past, 
women had it way worse." Well, maybe this is just  

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,240
your opinion. You're not an expert, you're not 
a professional in women's history, but you know  

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,380
what? You still want to share your opinion.
All right, let's go to the next controversial  

29
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:57,000
polite phrase. "From what I've heard, the US 
president is a little bit unstable." Well,  

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,100
this is just saying that you're not an expert, 
you don't really know, you've just heard some  

31
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,780
things. Maybe you read some articles, maybe you 
listened to some podcasts, maybe you heard your  

32
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,880
friends talking. So you can just say, "Well, 
from what I've heard," this doesn't mean that  

33
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,940
it's the facts, but it's just your opinion. 
Polite controversial expression number four,  

34
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:25,920
is a little tricky. You could say, "I don't mean 
this the wrong way," or, "Please don't take this  

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:35,160
the wrong way, but I think organized religion has 
done more harm than good." Wow. You're about to  

36
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,760
set fire to a giant, explosive conversation with 
that phrase, but you started this off by saying,  

37
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,820
"Please don't take this the wrong way." That 
means maybe you are very serious about your  

38
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,400
religion and the person who's talking knows that. 
So they're trying to say, "Hey, it's not personal.  

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,340
I'm not trying to say this in a personal way, 
this is just my opinion from my perspective.  

40
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,940
So please don't take this the wrong way."
But this phrase is very tricky because it can  

41
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:13,020
be said in a way that means, "I really don't care 
what you think. I really don't care if I offend  

42
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,940
you, I'm going to say something that's going to 
make you angry and I don't care." So it depends  

43
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,520
on your tone of voice. What if I had said it this 
way, "I don't mean this the wrong way, but I think  

44
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,400
that organized religion has done more harm than 
good." Okay, you can tell kind of my tone of voice  

45
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:35,580
is not caring, I'm not trying to be thoughtful or 
careful with the way I say it, I'm just saying it  

46
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,920
fast and, "Well, please don't take this the wrong 
way, but I think..." It's a little too harsh and  

47
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,800
brisk. So maybe you do want to offend the other 
person, well, you can say it like that, but if you  

48
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,260
don't want to offend the other person, just say 
it with a polite and kind tone of voice, "Please  

49
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,840
don't take this the wrong way, but I think," 
and then you can say your controversial opinion. 

50
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,060
All right, let's go to the next phrase. 
"If you ask me, eating a vegan diet is  

51
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,520
the only way to save our planet. If you ask 
me..." Well, okay, maybe they didn't ask you,  

52
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,520
but you're just sharing here that this is my 
opinion. "If you ask me, maybe if I ask you,  

53
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,620
you'll have a different opinion, but if you 
ask me," and then you're controversial opinion.  

54
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:28,140
Polite controversial expression number six is, "It 
could be that..." Here you are restating what the  

55
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:34,020
other person said and then you'll say your own 
opinion. Let's take a look at an example. Let's  

56
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,540
imagine that someone said, "Hey yeah, the earth is 
warming, but it's not because of humans. It's just  

57
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:46,260
natural." Well, you can use this phrase, "It could 
be that the earth is naturally warming and it's  

58
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:54,120
not due to humans, but I'm still going to try to 
recycle and reduce the waste that I have." Okay,  

59
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,880
so here you're affirming what they said, "I 
heard you. It could be that you're right,  

60
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,220
I don't know, but it's not going to change 
my actions." So this is a really great way  

61
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,020
to say your opinion. They know that you don't 
agree, but you're still being polite about it. 

62
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:17,100
Polite controversial expression number seven is, 
"As far as I know, most religions have been used  

63
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,060
as weapons of war in the past, but I'd love 
to hear your opinion." Okay, anything related  

64
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:30,420
to religion often gets inflammatory very fast, so 
feel free to insert whatever controversial opinion  

65
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:36,300
you would like to hear, something about politics, 
something about another heavy topic of the day,  

66
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,540
but our key phrase here, "As far as I know," shows 
that you're not an expert. You're just sharing  

67
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:49,020
your opinion, and you can tack on to the end, 
"But I'd love to hear your opinion." It means that  

68
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,540
you're not just blindly sharing what you think, 
you just said a really inflammatory, controversial  

69
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:59,820
statement. So now you're going to give them some 
time because you care about that other person  

70
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,120
and you're going to say, "But I'd love to hear 
what you think." Or, "But I'd love to hear your  

71
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,860
opinion." In fact, you could add this phrase to 
the end of any of these controversial statements.  

72
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:16,080
You're kind of opening up the floor and letting 
the other person have room to speak after you've  

73
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,060
just said something that lit the house on fire.
All right, let's go to our next controversial  

74
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:27,180
polite phrase. Polite phrase number eight, 
"Personally speaking, I think getting vaccinated  

75
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,780
for infectious diseases is the best way to care 
for yourself and others. What do you think?" Oh,  

76
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,740
well, maybe they don't agree with you, maybe 
you already know that they don't agree with you,  

77
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,140
but you're using this polite phrase, "Personally 
speaking, it's just my personal opinion,  

78
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:48,780
man. It's fine." And then you can open the floor 
and say, "But what do you think?" Great thing to  

79
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:56,160
say. Polite controversial expression number nine, 
"To put it another way, you'd be taking away a  

80
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,580
basic human right for half the population. To 
put it another way..." So maybe you're having  

81
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,380
this conversation and the other person just isn't 
really understanding where you're coming from,  

82
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,260
so you try to boil it down and make it as 
simple and clear as possible. So you say,  

83
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,960
"To put it another way, but I'd love to hear 
what you think." You can always add that to  

84
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,580
the end because in the end, I hope that you 
really do care what the other person thinks. 

85
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,040
Controversial polite expression number 
10, "The point I'm trying to make is  

86
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:36,000
giving someone absolute power over our country 
is a bad idea." So here you're trying to, again,  

87
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,320
boil down or summarize what you're saying, "The 
point I'm trying to make is it's not about that  

88
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,200
specific guy, it's not about that specific woman, 
in fact, it's about the concept in general." So  

89
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,180
you're trying to summarize your opinion. 
Polite controversial expression number 11,  

90
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:02,880
"I'm not saying that immigration is not a serious 
issue. What I'm trying to say is I don't think  

91
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,560
immigrants should be treated like criminals 
for just trying to find a better life." Okay,  

92
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,960
so this is a two part expression. First, we've 
got the misunderstanding. If you are at different  

93
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,240
points of the spectrum, you could say, "I'm 
not saying that," because maybe they said,  

94
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,400
"Hey, you think immigration is not a big deal." 
You say, "I'm not saying that immigration is  

95
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:30,660
not a big deal, but what I really mean is..." 
and then you can try to clarify your opinion,  

96
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,040
because you've probably been going around in 
circles and not really getting to the point. 

97
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,400
All right, let's get to the next expression. 
Expression number 12, "I'm not entirely convinced  

98
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:49,200
that aliens are real, but you never know." So here 
we're saying, "You know what? I'm not 100% either,  

99
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,700
but I'm not entirely convinced, but you never 
know." So you're trying to find some common  

100
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,320
ground. The other person says, "Absolutely not. 
There are no aliens. There will never be aliens.  

101
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:08,760
This is impossible." You might say, "Well, I'm 
not entirely convinced myself, but you never  

102
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,220
know." So you're kind of leaving that door open 
and saying, "Hey, I agree too, but I still want  

103
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:21,600
to have some room for possibility." Expression 
number 13, "I see what you're saying, but... I  

104
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,240
hear what you're saying, but..." shows you're 
listening, but then you also want to share your  

105
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,460
opinion. "I see what you're saying, but I just 
think gender identity is a very personal issue  

106
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,400
and we shouldn't treat people differently based on 
that." Okay, well, you're acknowledging that they  

107
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,500
have said something different, but you still want 
to share your opinion. "I see what you're saying,  

108
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:50,400
but here's my controversial opinion."
Controversial phrase number 14, "Hear  

109
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,440
me out on this." Hear me out on this means the 
other person's talking so much, they're just not  

110
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,060
giving you room to speak and they just shot down 
your idea right away and said, "No, that's not  

111
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:06,960
a good idea." So you use this phrase, "Hey, okay, 
hear me out on this. By giving education to women  

112
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,360
and girls, we could drastically reduce poverty 
around the world. We have to focus on this."  

113
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,240
Okay, they gave you one second to be able to 
say your opinion because you used that phrase,  

114
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,460
"Hear me out on this." "Please listen to me," 
is what you're really trying to say. "Hear me  

115
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,180
out on this. I just want to tell you what 
I think. Please listen for just a moment." 

116
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,580
All right, let's go to our next phrase. 
Controversial polite phrase number 15 is a  

117
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:41,820
very indirect phrase, "I wonder if it's possible 
that there was some propaganda involved in the  

118
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,420
research of this. Do you know who funded this 
research? I wonder if it's possible that..." So  

119
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,760
we've got wonder. We've got, "If it's possible," 
this is a very indirect. So maybe you think,  

120
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,680
"Nope, that is absolutely biased. There was a 
lot of propaganda in that," but you don't want  

121
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,260
to say it so directly. You could use this indirect 
phrase, "I wonder if it's possible that there was  

122
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:11,460
some propaganda involved in this project. Do you 
know who funded the research?" Oh, lovely phrase. 

123
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:18,240
Let's go to the next one. Controversial, but 
polite phrase number 16 is, "I'm not sure if it's  

124
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,620
true that the world is run by a secret society 
of lizard people, but who am I to." Say this  

125
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,800
phrase is often used for conspiracy theories or 
things that you really just don't want to debate.  

126
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,500
You could say, "I'm not sure it's true that I 
don't know your religion is the best religion,  

127
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:45,180
but who am I to say?" That last phrase is key 
here. It means, "I'm not in authority, so don't  

128
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:51,540
take my opinion for it. You can still believe 
what you want to believe. Who am I to say?" It  

129
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:57,300
kind of puts yourself out of the spotlight and 
it allows the other person to keep the integrity  

130
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,160
of their position. And it can also mean, "Hey, 
I don't want to debate this. Who am I to say I  

131
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,060
don't really want to talk about this anymore."
All right, let's go to our next phrase. Phrase  

132
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:13,740
number 17 is kind of soft, but kind of direct 
too, "I'm afraid I don't agree that the earth is  

133
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:20,760
flat. There's a lot of evidence to suggest that 
it is round. I'm afraid I don't agree that..."  

134
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,960
So you're not really afraid here, you're 
not scared of something, but that phrase,  

135
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:31,560
"I'm afraid that" is a very soft way to introduce 
something. Let's say that your boss asks you,  

136
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,180
"Hey, are you going to have that project done 
by 3:00 PM?" You could use this lovely phrase,  

137
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,940
"I'm afraid that I won't have it done by 3:00 PM, 
but I can have it finished by the end of the day."  

138
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,020
It's a very soft way to introduce something.
All right, let's go to our next phrase.  

139
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,320
Controversial polite phrase number 18 also uses, 
"I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I don't really know  

140
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,920
enough to speak on that topic, but here's my 
opinion. It seems like the president's economic  

141
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,980
policy is really going to damage the poorest in 
our country." Okay, so here at the beginning,  

142
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,320
you are emphasizing that, "I'm not an expert." 
That's kind of the theme with a lot of these as  

143
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,540
you're trying to remind the other person, and 
a good reminder to yourself, that this is just  

144
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,520
your opinion. So you can use this great phrase, 
"I'm afraid that I don't really know enough to  

145
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,740
speak on it, but here, I'm going to speak on it 
anyway." And you can always tack onto the end,  

146
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,660
"But I'd love to hear what you think," is just 
a good way to open the floor to someone else. 

147
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,740
All right, let's go to the next phrase. 
Controversial, but polite phrase number 19,  

148
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:40,260
we're almost at the end, is kind of a two 
for one deal. It is, "I could be wrong,  

149
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:47,940
or correct me if I'm wrong, but invading that 
country was an act of war that wasn't justified  

150
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:54,900
so I think the politicians should be tried as war 
criminals." Okay, that's a very big statement and  

151
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:02,220
you're kind of opening it up to say, "Correct me 
if I'm wrong. Well, I could be wrong," and you're  

152
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,320
just kind of prefacing it with that idea that, 
"I'm not an expert, but here's my opinion anyway." 

153
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,400
And our final controversial, but polite expression 
is for when someone else says a very inflammatory  

154
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:21,180
statement that you just can't be silent about, but 
maybe you realize, "Hey, I don't want to launch  

155
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:27,120
into a huge conversation with you about it." 
Maybe they say, "Well, men are just natural born  

156
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,920
leaders. Women can't be leaders. Women can't be in 
politics. They can't be administrators. Men will  

157
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,060
always be better at that." Well, if you disagree, 
you can simply say, "Well, that's one way of  

158
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:46,560
looking at it." So you're letting them know, 
"That's one way of perceiving this situation. I  

159
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,480
have a different opinion, but I'm going to kind of 
cut off the conversation here because I don't want  

160
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,480
to talk about it. Well, that's one way of looking 
at it." And it kind of preserves your dignity too,  

161
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,280
because you're not just arguing senselessly with 
someone who you don't agree with and you don't  

162
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,860
ever think will come to your way of seeing things.
Whew. I hope that these 20 controversial,  

163
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,620
but polite expressions help you the next time 
that you're in a sticky situation where you're  

164
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,060
talking about something controversial, but 
you would love to be polite and maintain a  

165
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,860
relationship with the other person. And
