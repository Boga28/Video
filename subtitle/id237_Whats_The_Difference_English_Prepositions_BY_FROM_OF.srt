1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,159
Hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,068
Today we're going to learn about

3
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:09,340
three important prepositions in English grammar.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,278
You'll learn the difference between the preposition by, 

5
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,024
the preposition from

6
00:00:14,024 --> 00:00:15,815
and the preposition of.

7
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:19,335
And in English, they can be prepositions of time,

8
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:22,506
they can be prepositions of place, of movement

9
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,000
but actually

10
00:00:24,248 --> 00:00:27,301
several languages have only one word

11
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:29,278
for all three of these prepositions.

12
00:00:29,544 --> 00:00:33,967
So it's really easy to see how by, from and of

13
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,179
can be a little confusing when you try to use them in English.

14
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,710
But not anymore!

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,480
I'll show you when to use them and how to use each

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,590
of these prepositions.

17
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,814
Plus, there's a quiz at the end of this lesson

18
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:49,700
to test what you know and make sure you're using these

19
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,970
prepositions correctly in your English sentences.

20
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,273
Excuse my casual attire today, it is extremely hot.

21
00:00:58,273 --> 00:00:59,722
Thirty-eight degrees.

22
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:02,827
Not ideal for filming but let's give it a shot anyway.

23
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,809
Which of these prepositions is the most difficult

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,939
for you to use?

25
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,710
Let me know down in the comments.

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,580
Let's start today's lesson by reviewing each of these

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,762
prepositions individually.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,822
After that, we'll take a look at some of the cases where

29
00:01:23,822 --> 00:01:26,393
all three of these prepositions are possible

30
00:01:26,393 --> 00:01:27,490
but the meaning

31
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,239
or the way that it's used is slightly different.

32
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:33,095
There are lots of different ways to use the

33
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:35,335
preposition of in English.

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,615
Today, we're going to look at the top four most

35
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:41,269
common uses, starting with

36
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,324
possession and belonging.

37
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:47,812
So, we use of to show a relationship of possession

38
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:50,002
or belonging between two nouns.

39
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:52,415
Members of the club get free parking.

40
00:01:52,665 --> 00:01:55,805
Charles became the King of England.

41
00:01:56,065 --> 00:02:00,108
And this is similar to the way that we use apostrophe S 

42
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:02,405
or the possessive S in English.

43
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:05,703
My friend's mother is Indonesian.

44
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,389
So the apostrophe S

45
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:11,690
shows that the mother belongs to the friend.

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,930
We can use of to recreate this same sentence but keep

47
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:17,539
the exact same meaning.

48
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,952
The mother of my friend is Indonesian.

49
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,608
So in this version, of indicates

50
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:27,078
the relationship between the friend and the mother.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,523
This construction with of is very common

52
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:32,541
in languages like German

53
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:35,992
but in English, it is much more common to use that

54
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:40,913
possessive apostrophe S when we're talking about people

55
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:45,247
and use of when we're talking about things.

56
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,869
Sarah's house is down the road.

57
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,109
Rather than:

58
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,739
The house of Sarah is down the road.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,826
The colour of her hair was amazing.

60
00:02:55,185 --> 00:02:56,368
Rather than:

61
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:59,262
Her hair's colour was amazing.

62
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:03,395
We use of in quantifying expressions that describe

63
00:03:03,465 --> 00:03:07,145
a unit or an amount or a number of something.

64
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:10,944
This is really common with uncountable nouns.

65
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:13,945
When we need a way of measuring or counting

66
00:03:14,005 --> 00:03:15,654
an uncountable noun,

67
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,284
we'll say something like:

68
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,639
A cup of flour.

69
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,153
A grain of sand.

70
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,236
A drop of rain.

71
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:27,264
Thirty per cent of the population.

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,549
All of these nouns are uncountable

73
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:33,719
so to describe how much there is,

74
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:36,960
we need one of those quantifying expressions.

75
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,422
A cup of, a grain of, a drop of, thirty per cent of.

76
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:47,130
And we use of to explain the amount of

77
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,600
countable nouns as well.

78
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,600
There were hundreds of people at the airport.

79
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:55,159
There are millions of stars in the Milky Way.

80
00:03:55,515 --> 00:04:00,135
We can use of to describe the contents of something.

81
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,424
What's inside a box or

82
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:05,015
 a packet or a container of something.

83
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:06,955
A bag of chips.

84
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:08,842
A bottle of water.

85
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,405
A book of poetry.

86
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,050
A box of clothes.

87
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,719
And finally, for the fourth most common way

88
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,283
of using of,

89
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:24,163
we use of in expressions to show the exact

90
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,549
position of something.

91
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,599
The top of your head.

92
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,340
The back of the bus.

93
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:33,297
The side of the house.

94
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:35,793
The corner of the street.

95
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,390
The front of the queue.

96
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,614
I know how much prepositions frustrate you

97
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:45,636
especially when you're trying to move from B1

98
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:48,367
into B2 or C1 levels

99
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:52,227
and yet you're still making mistakes with these little words.

100
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:57,299
I've designed my Preposition  8x8 Course as a step-by-step

101
00:04:57,299 --> 00:05:00,743
guide for intermediate to advanced English learners

102
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:05,049
to go beyond the basics and learn eight different ways

103
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,349
to use eight prepositions in everyday spoken English.

104
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:12,854
In the course, you'll learn advanced word patterns

105
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,275
that will take your skills to the next level.

106
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:18,834
Plus, every lesson includes an interactive

107
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:20,515
speaking practice with me.

108
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:24,554
So you'll not only study and learn about prepositions,

109
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:27,991
you'll also practise and use them

110
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:30,405
naturally in your spoken English.

111
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:31,585
And guess what?

112
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,667
I've got a free lesson from that course

113
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,585
that you can try out for yourself.

114
00:05:36,924 --> 00:05:40,121
All of the details are down in the description

115
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:43,610
but I'll also remind you about it at the end of this lesson

116
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:45,424
so you can go and check it out then.

117
00:05:45,635 --> 00:05:50,424
From can be a preposition of time or of place.

118
00:05:50,765 --> 00:05:53,935
As a preposition of place, it describes the place

119
00:05:53,935 --> 00:05:57,244
where something starts so it links a noun.

120
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,053
a person or a thing,

121
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:02,574
to its origin or its starting place.

122
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,930
He sent me a postcard from Spain.

123
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:09,430
My friend went to Spain and sent me a postcard.

124
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,229
The postcard started in Spain before it travelled

125
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:14,709
to me here in Perth.

126
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:18,169
That hot wind is coming from the north.

127
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,900
So the wind originated in the north.

128
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,969
That's where it started and that's why it's so hot today.

129
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:28,805
The bread is from the bakery on High Street.

130
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:31,603
As a preposition of time,

131
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:35,105
from shows the time when something starts.

132
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:37,295
The shop is open from 9am.

133
00:06:37,805 --> 00:06:41,355
The opening hours start from 9, not before.

134
00:06:41,455 --> 00:06:42,694
They start at 9.

135
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:46,075
The rules will come into place from tomorrow.

136
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:50,755
So the rules start tomorrow, not before.

137
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:54,888
The sculpture dates from the 17th century.

138
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,380
The sculpture was made in the 17th century and that's

139
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,300
when it started to exist.

140
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,070
And finally, from is a preposition of distance

141
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,370
in both time and space.

142
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,239
The beach is five kilometres from here.

143
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,719
The airport is seven kilometres from the city.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,909
So from indicates the distance between these two places.

145
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,940
But we can also express distance in time.

146
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:26,034
I'll set an alarm for five hours from now.

147
00:07:26,265 --> 00:07:28,405
So five hours into the future.

148
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:31,415
Five hours after or later than now.

149
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:34,184
And that brings us to by.

150
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:38,171
By is another really versatile preposition.

151
00:07:38,171 --> 00:07:40,148
It can be used in lots of different ways

152
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:45,314
but the main way that we use the preposition by is to indicate

153
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:49,215
the person or the thing that completes an action.

154
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:52,380
So you could say that it introduces the doer 

155
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,487
of an action.

156
00:07:53,624 --> 00:07:56,345
A book by a famous author.

157
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:57,914
Who wrote the book?

158
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:00,368
A famous author.

159
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:03,235
A painting by Picasso.

160
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,784
Picasso is the doer.

161
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:06,335
He painted the picture.

162
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:11,065
We use by like this quite a lot in passive sentences.

163
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,536
So when you want to introduce the doer of an action

164
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,945
in a passive sentence, use by.

165
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:20,875
The car was driven by a woman with blue hair.

166
00:08:21,405 --> 00:08:24,155
I was shocked by what I saw on the news.

167
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,109
By can also describe a method.

168
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,669
It can indicate how something is done.

169
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,430
The ring was made by hand.

170
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,000
We travelled by train.

171
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,630
She improved her English by reading the newspaper.

172
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,500
So in all of these examples, by describes a method

173
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,200
of completing an action.

174
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,570
How did we travel?

175
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,250
By train.

176
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,630
How did she improve her English?

177
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,930
By reading the newspaper.

178
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:59,660
When by is a preposition of place, it means near or

179
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,390
to the side of something.

180
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,998
She lives by a park

181
00:09:03,998 --> 00:09:07,350
means she lives near or next to a park.

182
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,580
Frankie is always by my side.

183
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:13,009
Frankie stays close.

184
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,490
She stays next to me.

185
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,943
When by is a preposition of time, it means not later than.

186
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:22,858
So at or before.

187
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,790
Imaginary watch.

188
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:29,020
They're usually home by nine.

189
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,725
They get home at nine or maybe sometimes before nine 

190
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,389
but not after nine.

191
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:40,169
I've got another lesson that dives into the difference

192
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:42,639
between by and until.

193
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,974
It's right up here and it's quite useful

194
00:09:44,974 --> 00:09:48,570
when we're talking about using by related to time.

195
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:53,665
And finally we can use by to indicate measurements

196
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:54,945
and amounts.

197
00:09:55,235 --> 00:09:58,045
The room is three metres by four.

198
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:01,684
Sea levels rose by twenty centimetres.

199
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,295
They sell oil by the barrel.

200
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:08,485
Now, if only it was that simple.

201
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:12,045
But English prepositions are tricky little things.

202
00:10:12,065 --> 00:10:14,895
So let's go a little bit deeper into those moments

203
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:19,635
where you need to choose between by, from and of.

204
00:10:20,045 --> 00:10:22,435
A book by James Clear

205
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,657
is a book written by James Clear.

206
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,140
He wrote this book.

207
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,880
It's a book by him.

208
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,003
But a book from James Clear is a book

209
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:36,000
that James Clear gave me, right?

210
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,419
So in this case, he is the starting point of the book.

211
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:41,990
It's where it came from.

212
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,130
But a book of James Clear's is a book that

213
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,910
belongs to James Clear.

214
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,330
Maybe he lent it to me because he wanted me to read it.

215
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,100
A book of James Clear's is a book that belongs to him.

216
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:01,339
And a little earlier, we heard the example of a book

217
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:05,344
of poetry, meaning that this book

218
00:11:05,344 --> 00:11:09,287
is a collection of poetry or it contains poetry.

219
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,509
Do you see how changing something as small and

220
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:15,579
insignificant as a little preposition

221
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,776
can actually completely change the meaning of a sentence?

222
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,380
It's crazy, huh?

223
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,473
And when it comes to the verb made,

224
00:11:23,473 --> 00:11:26,148
things get a little more complicated.

225
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,650
When we say made from, we mean that it has been

226
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,929
used to manufacture or to create something else.

227
00:11:35,059 --> 00:11:38,018
It describes that there's been a transformation

228
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:40,170
during the process of making that object.

229
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,850
It's changed from one thing into something else.

230
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:46,895
Linen is made from flax.

231
00:11:46,985 --> 00:11:50,315
Or paper is made from wood pulp.

232
00:11:50,685 --> 00:11:55,154
In both these examples, the verb made can be substituted

233
00:11:55,154 --> 00:11:56,925
for the verb manufactured.

234
00:11:57,355 --> 00:12:01,835
When we say made of, we mean composed of.

235
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:05,585
So it describes the basic material of something,

236
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:09,275
something that you can still see or touch, it still

237
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,455
exists in its original form.

238
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,880
Her dress is made of silk.

239
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,310
The table is made of wood.

240
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,109
So in these examples, made can be substituted for composed.

241
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,160
And then of course, there's made by.

242
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:27,481
So by can describe

243
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:31,650
either how something was made or who made it.

244
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,030
The dress was made by my friend.

245
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,829
Or the dress was made by hand.

246
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:42,645
And there's one more area where I know some of you

247
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:45,596
get a little bit lost and that's talking about

248
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:48,574
a change in number or amount.

249
00:12:48,885 --> 00:12:50,155
Let me show you what I mean.

250
00:12:50,494 --> 00:12:53,514
There has been an increase of fifteen per cent

251
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,095
over the last five years.

252
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:59,655
The price has increased by fifteen per cent over the last year.

253
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:03,925
The price has increased from $1 to $1.15.

254
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:08,195
These three sentences all convey the same information.

255
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:11,439
They're all saying pretty much the same thing.

256
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:17,405
So how do you know when to use of, by or from?

257
00:13:17,794 --> 00:13:19,964
There's a little trick to this that I want to share.

258
00:13:20,265 --> 00:13:23,175
In this sentence, increase is a noun.

259
00:13:23,795 --> 00:13:25,165
An increase.

260
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:29,031
So actually, this is a collocation

261
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:31,208
where we use the noun increase.

262
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,265
with the preposition of.

263
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:34,313
So,

264
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,565
when increase is a noun, it's followed by of.

265
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:41,635
But here, increase is a verb.

266
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:46,414
When increase is a verb, it collocates with by.

267
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:50,154
The price has increased by fifteen per cent.

268
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:54,175
And here, from indicates the starting point.

269
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:58,802
Prices started at one dollar and ended

270
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,302
at one dollar fifteen.

271
00:14:00,663 --> 00:14:02,743
So there's a couple of rules here.

272
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:07,210
When you're talking about a change to an amount or number,

273
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:11,851
then verbs like increase, rise,

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,799
fall and decrease

275
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,618
are used with the preposition by.

276
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,386
And the nouns of these same verbs, an increase,

277
00:14:22,683 --> 00:14:25,306
a rise, a fall,

278
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:27,062
a decrease,

279
00:14:27,155 --> 00:14:30,545
these all collocate with the preposition of.

280
00:14:30,815 --> 00:14:34,166
Now these ones are all extra tricky because the noun 

281
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,285
and the verb forms are exactly the same.

282
00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:39,065
Thank you very much English!

283
00:14:40,315 --> 00:14:43,085
So just make sure you're paying attention to the

284
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,915
structure of the sentence.

285
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:47,245
Look out for the article.

286
00:14:47,565 --> 00:14:50,485
That's your clue that it's a noun rather than a verb.

287
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:52,594
I'll give you one more example.

288
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:56,915
Water levels fell by one metre.

289
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:01,145
We have our verb, by and then the amount.

290
00:15:01,585 --> 00:15:06,915
Experts noticed a fall of one metre in the water level.

291
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:11,555
So we have noun, of and then the amount.

292
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:15,905
Okay let's test your skills with a quick

293
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:17,665
prepositions quiz.

294
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:19,824
Choose the correct preposition.

295
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:20,969
Of,

296
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,950
from or by.

297
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,430
The house is made of bricks.

298
00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:40,470
Plastic is made from oil.

299
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,480
The number of visitors to the National Park has increased

300
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:55,397
from 300 per week to 1500.

301
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,020
The cake is a gift from my mum.

302
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,386
The cost of airfares has increased

303
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:16,658
by 15% over the past three years.

304
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,130
I sent my mum a Christmas card from Germany

305
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,590
while I was travelling.

306
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,280
The chair is made of plastic.

307
00:16:42,895 --> 00:16:45,585
The lasagna was made by my mum.

308
00:16:45,655 --> 00:16:48,255
I hope this lesson was interesting and that it

309
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:51,713
helped to make these three important prepositions

310
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:53,845
a little easier to understand.

311
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:57,085
