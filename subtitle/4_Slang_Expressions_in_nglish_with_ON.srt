1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,150
Oh, it's on. I'm Ronnie. And I'm here to
teach you some slang because it's what I

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,150
do. It's on, though. It's on. What's on?
Check. Is it on? Is it on? Today's slang

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:22,860
lesson is about "on". So, probably your
TV's "on", your laptop is "on", your

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,770
phone is "on". We never really turn our
phones off, do we? So, whatever you're

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:35,970
watching me "on" — hello. Ha-ha. Get
ready for some slang. Woo-hoo. It's on.

6
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,660
So, literally, this means that something
is.  has power to it. Well, so, for

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:49,770
example, I can say: "The oven is on."
It's the opposite of "off". I just

8
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,680
happen to have this.  this thing, here,
and I have a light on top of the hand.

9
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,270
So, the light is "on". Quite literally,
I can turn it "off". Okay. I did; I

10
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,770
turned it off, and I can turn it "on".
So, I can say: "The light is on" or

11
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,460
"It's on".

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,850
But, in slang, if I say: "It's on", it's
provocative. It means: "I want to start

13
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,620
a fight with you." Oh, I don't, but
that's what it means. It's in slang. So,

14
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,320
you will hear this in movies, like: "Oh,
it's on, bro. It's on. Bring it on. It's

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,350
on". "Bring it on" is also another way
to, like: "Let's start a fight"; sort of

16
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,230
some kind of a battle. So, if someone
says: "Oh, it's on." You're like: "Oh.

17
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,990
What's 'on'?" It means they want to
fight you. So, I don't know. Run? Try to

18
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:53,190
have a conversation with them. You know,
literally.  If something's "literal",

19
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,140
"literally", it means: This is the
meaning of it; and then we have the

20
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,520
slang meaning. So: "It's on" — the slang
meaning — means you're going to start a

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,160
fight, as I described; but if something
is literal, like "literature" or

22
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,350
"literally" — you guys know this,
especially from Brazil. Where's the

23
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:23,580
book? The book is on the table. It's on
the table. I can say: "The hand is on

24
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:29,670
the table." The candle, or the fake
candle: "The light is on." And it's

25
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,930
also: "On the hand" as a preposition.
The opposite of "off" is "on". Have you

26
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,240
left the oven on? Have you done that? I
did that. I was on a long bike ride.

27
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:50,040
Beautiful; amazing. And all of a sudden
I was, like: "Oh, oh. I think I left the

28
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,890
toaster oven on." I had to drive an hour
back home, and I didn't leave the

29
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,940
toaster oven on; I had turned it off.
But I didn't want my house to burn down;

30
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,860
didn't want my dog to die. So, yeah.
It's not a good memory.

31
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,930
Let's continue. If you're going
someplace; maybe you're at a restaurant

32
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,900
or you're going to get a couple of
drinks, or somebody says: "It's on me."

33
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,050
And you look at them and go: "No. You
physically don't have anything on you.

34
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,600
You're clean; you didn't slop anything
on you." But if someone says: "It's on

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,840
me" — this is a good thing. It means
that this person is going to pay. So,

36
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,110
let's say you go out for dinner and
somebody says: "Ah, you know, Ronnie,

37
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,570
don't worry about it. It's on me."
Ronnie's happy, like: "Yes. I don't have

38
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,220
to pay for this dinner! Perfect!" Or you
go someplace and somebody says: "All the

39
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,820
drinks are on me", like: "But they're
not on your head." It's not literal, not

40
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,740
literally on someone's head; it means
they're going to pay for you. This is

41
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:08,700
wonderful. "Don't worry; these drinks
are on me." But they're not sitting

42
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,960
there, like this: "All drinks on me."
It's not; it just means they're going to

43
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:21,420
pay. It also can talk about possession;
what you have. So, somebody might say:

44
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,450
"Oh, okay. Oh. I'd like to buy this."
Oh, but you know what? Because I'm old

45
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:34,590
and I carry cash, I say: "Oh. I don't
have any money on me." It means: "I,

46
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,150
physically, I'm not holding any money. I
don't have money; I'm not possessing

47
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,850
money." Because now everyone uses a
card. Right? A cash card, a debit card,

48
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:52,380
a credit card. "Oh no. I don't have my
wallet on me." It means: "I'm not in

49
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,360
possession of my wallet. I forgot my
wallet." This is a bad thing. Remember

50
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:03,690
to bring your wallet. Always happens to
me. Usually, I don't like to have my

51
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,190
phone on me if I'm going for walks; I
like to leave my phone at home. But,

52
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,730
inevitably, there will be something cool
that I want to take a picture of. I'm

53
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:21,660
like: "Aw, man, I don't have my phone on
me." So, I didn't bring my phone; I

54
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,050
can't take a picture of it. No Instagram
for me.

55
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,660
Another way that we use: "on me" in
slang is to blame someone. Let's say you

56
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,460
do something wrong, and you want to
admit to people, say: "Oh, you know,

57
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,540
that's on me. I did that. It's my fault.
It's my mistake." Or you can also blame

58
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:51,660
other people. If you say: "It's all on
me", it means: "It's my fault." But I

59
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,060
can say: "That's on you." Okay? That
means that's.  I'm saying: "It's your

60
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,290
fault". "Oh, that's on him. That's. 
that's his problem." You hear that a lot

61
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,240
in relationship movies, like: "That's on
him. He.  he owes you an apology."

62
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:14,160
Literally — okay? — is if something's
"on me", like a drink, it means it's

63
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,780
physically on your body. So, "on me" I
am wearing.  I have a beautiful

64
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,150
bracelet. So, it's physically "on" my
body. I'm wearing glasses — glasses are

65
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,140
"on me". And the last one: "I'm on it.
Don't worry about it; I got this." This

66
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:39,060
means: "I'm doing the task, or I'm doing
the work that needs to be done." So:

67
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,180
"I'm on it. Don't worry." So, your boss
will say: "Hey, come on. You have to do

68
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,080
this." Like: "I'm on it, lady. I've
already started the task. I'm doing the

69
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,680
task." But instead of saying: "I'm doing
this already", we say: "I'm on it." It's

70
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:07,290
shorter, faster. Literally — right? — if
you're "on" something, that means that

71
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:14,370
your body's physically "on" top of
something. So, I'm on the table. I'm

72
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,220
not, but if I was, I would say: "I'm on
the table."

73
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:23,930
And Ronnie's favorite: "Get it on".
"Bang a Gong (Get It On)". Who sings

74
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,180
that song? I don't know. But if you "get
it on" — oh, hmm, hmm — it means you

75
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:36,050
have sex. Yeah. So, I encourage everyone
to bang a gong, get it on; and I'll see

76
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,180
you next time, if you're lucky. I'm
Ronnie. Bye. If you want to see some
