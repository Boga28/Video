1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:09,669
Hi. My name's Ronnie, and I have a bottle
of water. What? So, sometimes when I go to

2
00:00:09,669 --> 00:00:16,840
a restaurant and I order water, people don't understand me.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,530
I'm in Canada, I'm speaking English, and I said:

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:27,180
"Water", and they look at me strange. And I go: -"Oh, you know? Water?"

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:36,570
-"Oh, water. Yes, water." -"No, no. It's water."
It's a t, right? W-a-t-e-r. This, in Canada,

6
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:45,479
we call a bottle of water. And I go: "Oh,
that's really crazy because it's a bottle

7
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,479
of water."

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:53,019
Now, I get called out all the time on having
an accent. Everyone has an accent. You have

9
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,679
an accent, depending on where you're from.
Everyone has an accent. So, first of all,

10
00:00:56,679 --> 00:01:01,659
I hate people who go: -"Oh, I don't got an
accent." -"Oh, mister, you have an accent.

11
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:08,260
Okay?" Everyone has an accent, and I'm going
to teach you how to improve yours or damaged

12
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:17,390
English-I don't know-to speak with an American/Canadian
accent. Oh my god. Where's this going?

13
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:24,430
So, I'm going to teach you a trick, and the
trick is about the "t". I am very excited

14
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:30,710
about this because I've been thinking about
this for, oh, maybe ten years. Why do Canadians

15
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:36,640
and Americans say "d"? It's a "t". I found
the reason, and I'm going to teach you.

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,060
Let's have some water, shall we?

17
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:47,560
We have three... four. I'm good at counting,
again. We have four rules. Okay? So, the "t"

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:56,261
pronunciation. Sometimes, as I told you,
we actually say the "t" like a "d". So, this

19
00:01:56,261 --> 00:02:02,890
is the rule. Rule number one: If it's between...
If the "t" is between two vowel sounds. So,

20
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:11,890
check this out. This "i" is a vowel, and "y"-sneaky
bugger-sometimes is a vowel, but it's a vowel

21
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:21,871
sound. So, we don't say: "ability" in Canadian
and American English; we say: "abilidy". That's

22
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:27,910
really strange, people. Canadians, Americans,
maybe you were drunk or cold when you were

23
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,560
doing this. I'm not too sure, 
but just nonsensical, really.

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:41,590
We don't say: "computer", as we should; we
say: "compuder". Hey, look at that computer,

25
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:49,970
eh? So Canadian to say "eh" at the end. So,
again, between two vowels-"u" and "e" are

26
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,180
vowels-we're going to pronounce it like: "compuder".
This is crazy.

27
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,380
The next one, as I said in the beginning:
"water". "a", "e" are vowels, and it's going

28
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,720
to be said like: "wader". When I was in Jamaica,
they said: "wata", and I was like: "Yes! Good.

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,590
Got it." Again, so what I've done to help
you-you're welcome-is I've just underlined

30
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,600
the vowel. So, "a", "e"; "e", "e"; "er", "er",
"er", "er". And again, this one, watch out:

31
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,880
"i" and "y". "y" is a vowel sound.

32
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:28,989
So, all of these guys, magically, you're going
to go from speaking your language to speaking

33
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:36,069
Canadian and American English with the crazy
accent, because we say: "header". The thing

34
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:42,850
that keeps you warm... Canada's cold in the
winter. We don't say: "heater"; we say: "header".

35
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,430
And this is even more confusing now, because
it looks like "header", but it's actually

36
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,150
this pronunciation: "heeder". Turn on the
heater, eh? It's cold.

37
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:01,750
This word, if you say it... Not "better" in
my books. If you say it with a Canadian/American

38
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:10,290
pronunciation; crazy way; we say: "bedder".
Then we say: "madder". And then, even though

39
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:20,760
we went to "university", we say: "universidy".
Eh? You following? I don't know why it's crazy.

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,380
Just say the "t" or write the "d".

41
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:32,300
The other rule with the "t" sounding like
a "d" is if it's between a vowel and an "l"

42
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:39,561
or an "r". So, as I said in the beginning...
I can't even say it. "Bottle". It's not a

43
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:46,440
bottle, Ronnie. So, if it's between an "o"
and an "l", it's going to be said like a "d",

44
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,930
so we say: "boddle". This is my vowel "a",
and this is an "l".

45
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:58,080
We don't say: "battle"; we say: "baddle".
Into battle, soldiers. One of Ronnie's favourite

46
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,651
words: "dirty". So, we don't say "dirty" because
we have an "r" and a vowel sound. So, this

47
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:13,560
is the example of a vowel and an "l"; this
is the example of a vowel and an "r". Okay?

48
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,900
So, a vowel and "l"; a vowel and "r". With
our numbers, again, we have a vowel and an

49
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:28,550
"r", so these ones are going to sound like
a "d". So, we're going to say: "dirdy", "fordy",

50
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,360
and "thirdy".

51
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,919
Have you turned thirty yet? As a joke, we
like to say... Or some people like to say:

52
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,440
"It's my dirty 30." We won't go into detail
with that. About that. I will let your imaginations

53
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,700
run wild on that one. And just make sure you
say: "dirdy" because no one is going to understand

54
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,100
you if you say "dirty". You're a dirty, wee
cow.

55
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,479
Next up. There are some cases-three of them-when
we don't even say the "t". Maybe this is easier.

56
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:09,400
No, it's not easier. So, we do two things.
First of all, we could change it to a "d"

57
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,180
and then we just completely take it out because
we don't it. We don't want that "t"; that

58
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:26,040
pesky "t". So, if your "t" comes after an
"n", it's going to be silent. This is mental.

59
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:38,050
So, we don't say: "interview"; we say: "in'erview".
I got a job interview. That was from... rednecks

60
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,450
represent. So, we say: "in'erview".

61
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:52,210
We don't say: "interstate"; we say: "in'erstate".
In case you don't know, an interstate in America

62
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:59,800
is a highway. We do not call them interstates
in Canada; we call them highways. That's fun.

63
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,960
So, interstate is only in America. America.
Welcome to America.

64
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,639
We also have the word "international". So,
if you're an international person, we're going

65
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:18,710
to take out the "t" and we're going to say...
"international" becomes "in'ernational". There

66
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:29,900
are many of these. As I said: "want", we say:
"wan'ed". So, all of these, we take out the "t".

67
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,980
This is a fun one. You'll hear people say:
-"I don' know. I don' know." -"What?" -"Don't

68
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,810
know." So, we take out the "t"; we say: "don'
know". This is another reason why "can't"

69
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,680
is confusing. When we say: "cannot"... "Can",
"can't". -"Did you say the 't'?" -"No." -"Oh.

70
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,310
Why didn't you say the 't'? Now I don't know
if it's positive or negative. What are you

71
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,900
doing?" So, we say: "don' know. I don' know."

72
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:06,699
We don't say: "printer"; we say: "prin'er".
We don't say: "enter"; we say: "en'er". The

73
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:17,789
number "twenty" we don't say; we say "twen'y".
So, check out our numbers: "twenty", "forty",

74
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:26,880
"thirty". Yeah, I don't know how we count
here. Don't count; math is crazy.

75
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,310
Rule number three, and this one's crazy as
well. We're going to change two things. First

76
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:38,570
of all, we are not going to say the "t" if
it is with an "n" and between some vowels;

77
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,690
and we're going to actually take out some
vowel sounds. So, for this one, we're going

78
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,930
to remove two sounds. As an example, we don't
say: "curtain", which it looks like; we actually

79
00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:02,770
say: "cur'in". A curtain is a cover for your
window. So, people might say: "Close the cur'in",

80
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,640
which we said it looks like: "Close the curtain."

81
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:14,011
You're going to go climb up a "mountain"?
No. You're going to climb up a "mou'in". These

82
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:20,690
vowels, we're going to take out the "t" and
the "a", and it's going to sound like "mou'in",

83
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:28,950
"cur'in". Another example of the "a" is we
don't say: "fountain"; we say: "fou'in". It's

84
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:34,720
an example with the "e": We don't say: "written"-I
do-but we actually say: "wri'in", so we take

85
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,010
out the "t" and the "e", and we change it
to an "in". We don't say: "forgotten"; we

86
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:54,260
say: "forgo'in". I've forgotten how to say
the "t". I've forgotten to say the "t".

87
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:02,560
This word is crazy; I always spell it wrong.
I always spell it: "sentance", but the pronunciation,

88
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:10,890
quickly, is: "sentence". My brain goes: "sentance";
but Americans and Canadians say: "sen'ince".

89
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:17,761
There's a phrase that people say about English
is that we eat our words or we mumble. This

90
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:22,810
is why, when you guys listen to English, you
think that we're very hungry and we're eating

91
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:29,570
our words, because we don't say everything.
[Mumbles] -"Make a sentence." -"What?" -"Sentence."

92
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:37,940
-"Oh." So, this one: "sen'ince". Again, the
"t" and the "e", we're going to put to "in",

93
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,300
so we're going to say: "sen'ince".

94
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,050
The last one, and maybe the most delicious
for us, because we're eating all of these,

95
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:55,640
is the "t" at the end of the word - we don't
say it. Sorry, we don't say it. We don't say

96
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,399
it. We don't say it. We don't say it. So,
if your "t" is at the end of the word in English

97
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:09,430
pronunciation, it actually has a fancy name;
it's called a stopped sound. So, a stopped

98
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,020
sound just means we don't say the "t".

99
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:21,930
So, we look at this and we say: "hot". And
then you come to Canada and America, and people

100
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:29,399
say: "ho'". What? "I'm ho'." So, we're going
to take out the "t"; we're going to say: "ho'".

101
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:36,050
For this one, something you wear on your head,
we're going to say: "ha'", "ha'". Something

102
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:41,490
on the floor is called a "mat" or also a person's
name. There are many people, many men named

103
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:48,280
Matthew; it gets shortened to "Matt", but
we don't say "Matt"; we say: "Ma'". "Ma',

104
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,070
ma'"; maybe he's a goat.

105
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:59,579
This word: If somebody has a lot of weight,
we don't say: "fat"; we say: "fa'". A group

106
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:10,480
or a parcel of land is called a "lo'"; not
a "lot". There's a pesky animal, it's a rodent,

107
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,260
and it's called a "ra'"; not a "rat". So,
all of these ones... Here's another example.

108
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:23,279
We don't say: "foot"; we say: "foo'". Foot,
foot, foot. It sounds like we're not saying

109
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,740
the "t".

110
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:32,010
I've said this before: "want", "wanna". We
don't say: "want"; we say: "wan'. I wan'".

111
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:38,779
"I want" - we don't say the "t". "Si' down.
Si' down." We don't say: "Sit down"; we say:

112
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:47,740
"Si' down". And don't smoke it; it's "pot".
So, when we say the word "pot", we don't say

113
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,410
the "t". English; craziness.

114
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,790
Now, if you're studying English in another
country-Australia, England, Ireland, Scotland,

115
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:05,690
Wales, anywhere that's not Canada or America-you
don't have to worry about this, but it will

116
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:12,150
help you perfect your American accent. So,
if you want to practice speakin' like an American,

117
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:18,170
all you have to do is watch out for these
four rules; between two vowel sounds, or between

118
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:25,330
a vowel and "l" or "r", we change to a "d".
This is the most popular one, I think. After

119
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:30,760
the... Or the most noticeable, in my brain.
After an "n", we don't say the "t". A "t"

120
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,870
with an "n", we change it to "in"; we don't
say the "t". And, again, we don't say the

121
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,610
"t" at the end of the word. So, I'm out of
here.
