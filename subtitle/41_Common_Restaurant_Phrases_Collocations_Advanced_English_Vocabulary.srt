1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,190
How often do you feel like the things
that should be simple in English are

2
00:00:05,191 --> 00:00:07,650
never really that simple. For example,

3
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:11,370
going to a coffee shop to order a
coffee or going to a restaurant.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,010
I know when I first moved abroad,

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,240
it was those everyday interactions
that should be easy that

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,430
caused the most anxiety. When I
would sit at a cafe to order lunch,

7
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:27,240
my face would flush or turn
red and my hands got sweaty.

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,320
Does that ever happen to you?
If you don't already know,

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,780
I'm Annemarie with
Speak Confident English,

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,430
everything I do here is designed to
help you get the confidence you want for

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:40,170
your life and work in English,

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:45,570
like going to a restaurant so that
you no longer have to stress or feel

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,320
anxious about those simple
everyday things. Instead,

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,730
you can just enjoy them.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,830
And that is exactly the goal for
today's Confident English lesson on 41

16
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,510
common phrases and collocations to
use at a restaurant in English. Now,

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,800
if you're new to my Speak Confident
English channel, first of all, welcome.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,530
I love that you're here. And secondly,

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,890
that word collocations may be new to you.

20
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,810
So let's talk about it for a moment.

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,580
A collocation is a group of words
that English speakers use together

22
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:20,910
naturally. Let me give you an example.

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:24,930
What do you say when you meet someone
for the very first time in English?

24
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,090
You say, nice to meet you.

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,640
You don't say joy to meet you. Why not?

26
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,860
Joy to meet you has the same
meaning as nice to meet you,

27
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,210
but it just doesn't sound
right. It's not what we say.

28
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,120
Those words don't go together.

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,100
And that's exactly what a collocation
is. By the end of this lesson today,

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,960
you'll have a variety of common
phrases and collocations that English

31
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:59,730
speakers naturally use at restaurants
so that you can do the same with

32
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,570
confidence.

33
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,263
[Inaudible].

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,400
All right. I hope that you have some
paper and a pencil or pen ready for today

35
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,720
because we have a lot of phrases and
collocations to learn in this lesson.

36
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:19,470
You'll learn what you need to
successfully make a reservation,

37
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,480
greet others at a restaurant,
inquire about the menu order,

38
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:28,620
what you want, express
frustration, or make a complaint.

39
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,330
If you need to respond to the
question, how is everything,

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,720
which you will hear a lot
at a restaurant in English.

41
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,800
And finally what to say when you're
ready to finish your meal and make the

42
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,634
payment.

43
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,470
So let's get started right away with
that first step of asking for a table or

44
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:50,040
making a reservation. Of
course, most of the time,

45
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:54,120
these days we do it online, which
takes away that pressure and anxiety,

46
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,280
but there are still some restaurants
that prefer or even require

47
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,090
reservations to be made by phone.
So when that is your situation,

48
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,750
here are a few ways to make
your reservation. First,

49
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:11,500
when you make that phone call,
you can simply state your wish.

50
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,620
I'd like to book a table for three,

51
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,410
or I'd like to book a
table for three people.

52
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:22,360
A common alternative is I would
like to reserve a table for three

53
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,560
when making a reservation. If you want
to make it just a bit more polite,

54
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:31,240
you could turn it into a polite
request with may I book a table for

55
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:31,990
three,

56
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:36,430
or could I make a reservation for
three in those last two examples,

57
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:40,870
did you notice that I used
modals? I used may and could.

58
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,600
Modals are those words such
as may, could, would, should,

59
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,450
and might when we use modals,

60
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:54,190
we automatically increase the level
of formality and politeness in our

61
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:56,890
speech. After the
reservation has been made,

62
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:59,560
and you first arrive at the restaurant,

63
00:03:59,561 --> 00:04:04,540
you may wonder what exactly you
should say after arriving and how

64
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:09,010
to ask about your reservation.
And it's very simple. First,

65
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:12,880
we always start with a greeting
because that is a form of politeness.

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,860
And then you can ask about the
reservation. Here's how to do that. Hello?

67
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,730
I have a reservation under
Annemarie Fowler, or hi,

68
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:24,220
I have a table booked
under Annemarie Fowler.

69
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,080
Pay attention to the collocations I'm
using here and the preposition under

70
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,700
to have a reservation under
the name of Annemarie Fowler,

71
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,440
or to have a table booked
under someone's name. Now,

72
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,520
if you arrive at a restaurant and you've
not made a reservation in advance,

73
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:46,270
you can follow a similar
structure, start with a greeting,

74
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,980
and then simply ask if there's a
table available, for example. Hi,

75
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:54,910
do you have any tables free
at the moment or hello,

76
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,130
are there any tables
available for three right now?

77
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,820
Once you're at your table
and start to review the menu,

78
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:03,820
you may have some questions
you'd like to ask about the menu,

79
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,470
or you may even want to ask about
some recommendations in this section.

80
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,550
We're also going to highlight
some examples of contractions.

81
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:16,870
We use contractions are used in
everyday conversation in English.

82
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:19,150
They make our speech sound more natural.

83
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,800
So I want you to pay attention to how I
ask some of these questions and listen

84
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:27,880
carefully. For those examples
of contractions. First,

85
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,440
let's look at three different ways.

86
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:34,240
We can ask for a recommendation or
maybe find out what's popular at the

87
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:37,810
restaurant or whether they
have any specials. Number one,

88
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,980
what are today's specials?
What are today's specials?

89
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,140
Listen carefully to how I'm
saying, what are today's specials?

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,530
What are, what are today's specials?

91
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,110
Do you notice that those two
words, what are, are blended.

92
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,570
They're contracted. What
are today's specials?

93
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,610
What are today's specials?

94
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,480
A second question you can
ask is what do you recommend?

95
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,530
This is a perfect question to ask if
the chef is particularly well known,

96
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,360
or if you want to discover something
that this restaurant is well-known for.

97
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,980
And a third question you can ask to find
out what's popular or recommended is,

98
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,220
do you have any house specials again?

99
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,570
How special is something that the chef
or restaurant is particularly well known

100
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:29,690
for? In addition to asking
for recommendations,

101
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,850
it's also very common to ask what is
included with an item when you're ready to

102
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:36,380
order, for example,

103
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:40,820
does this burger come with a side of
fries or does this salmon come with a side

104
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,840
of vegetables? Does this come
with a salad on the side?

105
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:50,180
Anything that comes with the main
item on the menu is considered a side

106
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:54,620
or a side dish. And of course,
just like asking about a side dish,

107
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:58,790
you might also want to know how
a particular dishes made or what

108
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:02,480
ingredients are in it. And you
can ask in two simple ways,

109
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,040
first you could ask what's
in, what's in the pasta salad,

110
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,120
what's in the salmon dish
or option number two,

111
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,290
what's the lemon mousse
made with. And notice again,

112
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:17,360
here that I'm using a contraction.

113
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:21,140
I'm not saying what is the
lemon mousse made with?

114
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,830
I'm using what's what's
the lemon mousse made with?

115
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,790
Once you've had all your questions
answered, it's time to order,

116
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,620
and we have multiple ways to order
from a restaurant in English in this

117
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:37,640
section. Again, I want you to pay
attention to what you hear me say,

118
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,080
because again, I'll be
using some contractions or
examples of blended speech.

119
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,630
Here are four ways. English speakers,

120
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,250
often order at a restaurant first
may have, uh, may I have a burger,

121
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:53,540
please listen carefully
to how I say have, uh,

122
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,460
may have, uh, may have, uh,
may have a burger. I'd like,

123
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,080
uh, I like, uh, I'd like
a salad. I'll have, uh,

124
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,540
I'll have a salad. And could I
get the, could I get the salmon?

125
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,970
If you're at a more casual restaurant
you can also use, can I get, uh,

126
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,040
can I get a burger listen carefully
to the pronunciation? Can I get, uh,

127
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,580
can I get a burger or I'll get,

128
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,970
I'll get the salmon when you're ordering.

129
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:29,660
You might also want
something extra on the side.

130
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,420
We're going to go back to
the same language we used.

131
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,259
When asking about what comes
with an item, for example,

132
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,789
you might say I'd like the
salmon with a salad on the side,

133
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,149
or I'd like a salad with
the dressing on the side.

134
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,390
I'd like a burger with a side of fries.

135
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,190
And when you would like to order
one thing in place of another,

136
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,890
or to substitute another, you can simply,

137
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,920
can I substitute a salad for the fries?

138
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,600
What you're asking is can I have
a side salad instead of the fries?

139
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,790
Here's another example. Can I substitute
a side of vegetables for the fries?

140
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,890
Here's another way to say it.

141
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,960
Can I substitute the fries with
a side of vegetables? Again,

142
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:19,560
your preference is to have
a side of vegetables. Okay.

143
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:23,520
So we've covered making a reservation,
arriving at the restaurant,

144
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,190
inquiring about the menu and ordering.

145
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,620
There are just a few things left to cover.

146
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,460
We want to talk about expressing
frustration or making a complaint.

147
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,290
If it's necessary, how to
respond to the common question,

148
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,430
how is everything?

149
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,930
And then finally what to say when you're
ready to finish the meal and make your

150
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:47,640
payment. So let's talk about
what to say when things go wrong,

151
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,470
maybe your food arrives late, or it's
not prepared the way you expected.

152
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,930
How do you express that frustration?

153
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,760
We're going to focus on two common
scenarios. First, what to say,

154
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:02,700
when something isn't prepared,
the way you expected,

155
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,120
and maybe you'd like to get it
remade or order something else.

156
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,890
And the second scenario is what
to say when you've been waiting an

157
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,990
extra long time for your food.

158
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,630
So first what to say and how to
ask for something to be remade,

159
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,700
you can start with a simple and
polite, excuse me. Excuse me.

160
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,290
This dish isn't prepared the way I
expected it to be. Could I have it remade?

161
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,180
Or could I order something
different when you use that request?

162
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:37,770
It's very likely that someone
will ask you what exactly doesn't

163
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,270
meet your expectations.

164
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:44,190
So you want to be prepared to talk about
the fact that maybe there's a spice in

165
00:10:44,191 --> 00:10:46,140
the dish that you weren't prepared for,

166
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,650
or maybe the meal wasn't
cooked the way you anticipated.

167
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,600
And it's just not what you want.

168
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,380
So you'd like to have it remade
or order something different.

169
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,620
Here's another example, excuse me.

170
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,370
I asked for no cilantro in this
dish, but there's a lot in my food.

171
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,210
Could I have it remade. And
now scenario number two,

172
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,600
if you've been waiting a
particularly long time for your food,

173
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,790
here's a very simple way to express
that frustration and ask when you

174
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:19,500
can expect it to arrive, excuse me,
we ordered our food sometime ago,

175
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,230
or we ordered our drinks sometime ago.

176
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,910
Will the food be much longer
or will it be much longer?

177
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,690
Although it doesn't happen
often from time to time,

178
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,670
you may wait so long for your food
that you no longer have time to

179
00:11:35,671 --> 00:11:37,440
stay at the restaurant and enjoy it.

180
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,250
Maybe you're just on a quick lunch
break and you have a meeting to get to,

181
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,750
or maybe you're going to a movie after
dinner. So you're pressed for time.

182
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,850
In that situation, you can ask
for your food to go. For example,

183
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,190
excuse me. I'm running late.
Have to get to a meeting.

184
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,710
Could I get my food to go instead?

185
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,100
Or could I get everything
packaged to go instead?

186
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,560
And now let's move on to how to
respond to the most common question.

187
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:09,700
You're going to hear at a restaurant
and you will hear it multiple times at a

188
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:14,650
restaurant, particularly in the United
States, you will hear how is everything,

189
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,990
how is everything you will hear at
least two or three times throughout your

190
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:23,620
meal? And when you do,
here's what you can say.

191
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,580
Everything's delicious. Thank
you. Everything's great. Thanks.

192
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,500
We're enjoying our meal. Thank
you. It's great. Thanks. Now,

193
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,790
in addition to hearing,

194
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,770
how is everything you might also
hear how's everything tasting or are

195
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:40,090
you happy with your meal?

196
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,830
You might also wonder why you'll hear
this question so many times. And for us,

197
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,190
it's simply a form of
politeness at a restaurant.

198
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,210
They want to make sure that you're
satisfied and they will ask you multiple

199
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:55,930
times to make sure that you are,
when you hear those questions.

200
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,830
There are also opportune moments
to request something else.

201
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,650
Maybe you'd like a substitute
or something on the side.

202
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,970
Maybe you'd like another drink. Those are
perfect opportunities to ask for that.

203
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,081
And finally,

204
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:12,940
to finish our lesson on 41 common
phrases and collocations to use

205
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,500
at a restaurant in English.

206
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,700
Let's talk about what to say when you've
finished your meal and you're ready to

207
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:21,700
pay first. If you're in the United States,

208
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,620
it's very likely that you
will not be able to finish all

209
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:31,060
of your dinner or your lunch. The
portions here are particularly large.

210
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:33,970
So you might want to
ask for something to go.

211
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,280
If you can't eat everything,

212
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,180
you'll have some
leftovers and you can ask,

213
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:45,130
could I box up the leftovers
or could I get the rest to go?

214
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,780
And when you're ready to pay, you
can ask, may I get the check please?

215
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:52,960
Or may I get the bill, please?
Could we get the check?

216
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:57,550
Please notice I'm going back
to using those modals may and

217
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:00,490
could to make a polite request.

218
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,670
If you're having lunch or
dinner with multiple people,

219
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:07,990
and everyone wants to pay separately.
When you're asking for the check,

220
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,670
you could also ask for it to
be made separate. For example,

221
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:14,740
we'd like separate bills please.

222
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,570
Or could we get separate checks
and a more casual way to ask this

223
00:14:19,571 --> 00:14:23,290
is, could we split the check?
Could we split the bill?

224
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,180
And lastly, once you've paid the bill,
if you do it by credit or debit card,

225
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,720
you can easily include
the tip on the receipt,

226
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,740
sign your name and you're finished.
However, if you pay with cash,

227
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,720
you can leave money on the table and
to let the staff know that it's a

228
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:44,380
tip, you can simply say, keep
the change. And with that,

229
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:49,150
you have everything you need to know
to successfully go to a restaurant and

230
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:52,640
order in English without
any anxiety or fear.

231
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,340
I absolutely recommend that you
select a few key phrases that are most

232
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:02,180
useful to you and practice
saying them multiple times.

233
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,820
If you've been following
me for awhile, you know,

234
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:09,230
that the key to remembering
vocabulary and feeling

235
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:13,400
comfortable with it is
repetitive practice.

236
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:18,980
So let's talk a little bit about some
of the key phrases that you want to

237
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:23,150
remember. I have a couple of challenge
questions for you. Number one,

238
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,980
is there a new phrase or collocation
that you've learned today in this lesson

239
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,790
that you've never heard before?
Or maybe you have heard it,

240
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:36,680
but you were never really sure what
it meant or how it was used. If so,

241
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:41,660
I would love to hear about it and I'd
like you to use it in an example sentence,

242
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,520
you can share your sentence with me
in the comments below. Number two,

243
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,560
are there other phrases or
collocations you've heard before for

244
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:55,400
ordering at a restaurant or going to a
coffee shop that you're curious about?

245
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,890
If you'd like to ask me a question,

246
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,530
you can always do that in
the comment section below.

247
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,610
If this lesson today was helpful
to you, I would love to know.

248
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,490
And you can tell me in
one very simple way,

249
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,090
simply give it a thumbs up here on
YouTube. And while you're at it,

250
