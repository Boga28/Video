1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,890
Well, I'm sure you've noticed

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,570
that the year 2021 is
slowly coming to an end,

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:08,670
and I just wanted to make
this last video of the year

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,440
as a thank you to all of you,

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,220
to all of you who watch my
English lessons here on YouTube.

6
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,680
I have had a very

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,570
enjoyable year making
English lessons for you.

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,910
It's a lot of fun to come up with ideas,

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,760
to go out with my camera and
to get all of the footage

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,030
and then to do some editing,

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,830
and then lately Audrey has

12
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,220
actually been doing some editing for me.

13
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,750
So that's been fun as well.

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,570
I'm not sure if you noticed
that change back in September.

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,400
The editing got a little bit
more cooler, I would say.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,590
But anyways, I enjoy
coming up with the ideas.

17
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:40,860
I enjoy shooting the videos.

18
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,200
I enjoy thinking about how
the lessons should look,

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,760
and I enjoy delivering the lessons to you.

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,660
But above all, I just
want to say thank you

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,020
for watching these English lessons.

22
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,610
It's fun to see a lot of views on a video.

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,260
It's fun to see my subscriber count grow,

24
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,670
and none of that is possible

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,600
if you don't actually like
the lessons that I'm making.

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,459
So thank you very, very much for watching.

27
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,840
I thought I would kind of recap the year

28
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,690
by looking back on some highlights,

29
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,810
some things that I really
enjoyed about the past year.

30
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,960
I'll look at a couple of
videos that did really well.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,850
I'll talk about a video
that did really well

32
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,610
that actually was a surprise to me

33
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,090
and a few other things as well.

34
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,820
So let's get started with that.

35
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,130
The top performing video this past year,

36
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,837
the video that had the
most views was the video

37
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:32,770
"Learn 60 English Action
Verbs in Under 10 Minutes."

38
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,980
This was a video I made last January.

39
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,760
I went outside on a winter day

40
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,470
and I had a big list of
English action verbs,

41
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,050
and I tried to act them
all out as best as I could,

42
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,710
and people obviously really
enjoyed seeing me act out verbs,

43
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,250
like to flick and to punch,

44
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,800
and I think I even danced a little bit.

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,030
The second video,

46
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,947
the second most popular
video this past year was

47
00:01:56,947 --> 00:01:59,730
"How to Order Food at a
Restaurant in English."

48
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,480
This is a video I actually made

49
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,070
a couple of years ago already,

50
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,930
but it continues to remain one

51
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,610
of the most popular videos that I've made.

52
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,110
I think because I go out in the world,

53
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,910
and I actually have English conversations

54
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,940
as I order the food.

55
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,280
So I'm going to try and
do a few more videos

56
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,520
like that in the year to come.

57
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,200
There was one video that was
very much a surprise for me.

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,620
On Friday, I do live English lessons

59
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,130
where I teach a series of
vocabulary words on one topic,

60
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,400
and I did one a little
while ago on everyday items.

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,270
I usually repackage those
videos, so they're a bit smaller.

62
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,240
I remove all of the viewer questions

63
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,980
and make it a pure lesson.

64
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,350
And that repackaged version,
the lesson-only version

65
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,070
of "Free English Class!
Topic: Everyday Items"

66
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:48,270
has 305,000 views,

67
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,590
and I only did the video a few months ago.

68
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,510
And it continues in the last few weeks

69
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,410
to be one of my best performing videos.

70
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,350
I think the reason is

71
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,300
because people don't always know the names

72
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,340
for the simplest things
that we use in life.

73
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,900
I actually made this lesson

74
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,080
because it was a list of things

75
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,130
where I didn't know
the French word for it.

76
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,340
I know you're learning English.

77
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,360
I'm continually learning French.

78
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,057
It was actually a list
of words where I'm like,

79
00:03:14,057 --> 00:03:17,320
"I don't know the French
word for this or for that."

80
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,700
So I guess because it was
a very useful lesson to me,

81
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,890
when you reverse it,

82
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,020
it was also a very useful
English lesson for all of you.

83
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,250
If I look back on the year,

84
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,850
one of the highlights of the year

85
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,520
for me was definitely
doing a collaboration

86
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,440
with Lucy from "English with Lucy"

87
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,000
and with Rachel from "Rachel's English."

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,860
I have a lot of respect and admiration

89
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,510
for both of those English
teachers on YouTube.

90
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,090
They make incredible lessons
and continue to do so.

91
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,380
By the way, there's links
to both of their channels

92
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,570
in the description below

93
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,240
and all the other videos
I talked about as well.

94
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,370
But working with those
two was just awesome,

95
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,940
and I look forward to next summer

96
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,770
when hopefully I can find some time

97
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,980
to do more collaborations
with other YouTubers

98
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,510
who teach English as well.

99
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,710
By the way, I still teach during the day.

100
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,350
I go to a school and teach.

101
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,480
So I don't always have a lot of time

102
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,040
for collaborations from
September until about June,

103
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,460
but in July and August,

104
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,700
I usually have a little bit more time,

105
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
and so hopefully I can find some time

106
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,920
to collaborate more with
other teachers on YouTube.

107
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,270
And then of course,
there's my second channel,

108
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,060
which some of you might know
about and some of you don't.

109
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,717
The most popular video
on my second channel was

110
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,090
"Fall Flat and Fall Into Place,"

111
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,030
learning those two
phrases, had 8,000 views.

112
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,860
Quite surprising actually for me

113
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,160
to see that channel turn into
a real resource for people.

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,740
It's something I started because I used

115
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,620
to wait by my van for my kids to come out

116
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,690
in order to go to school.

117
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,460
So I thought I would use my phone

118
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,150
to shoot short little videos,

119
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,760
and it grew into three
four-minute videos every week.

120
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,720
Not as many viewers as on my
main channel, but that's okay.

121
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,600
It's still fun to do,
and I really enjoy it,

122
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,760
and people, I think, get
a lot of value out of it.

123
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,030
It's also a place where you
get to know me a bit better

124
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,410
because the last minute of
each video is usually me

125
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,220
just vlogging a little bit
or reflecting on my day.

126
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,110
So if you ever wanna hear me speak faster,

127
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,530
head over to "Bob's
Short English Lessons,"

128
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,180
my other channel, a great place I think

129
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,000
to learn little English
phrases three times a week.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,970
And then what's my plan for 2022?

131
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,080
Well, I'm kind of a boring
person, more of the same.

132
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,560
I don't have any huge
plans to change anything.

133
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,180
I'm still gonna do a
live lesson every Friday.

134
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,540
I'm gonna do live lessons on Saturdays.

135
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,530
I might scale back a bit on that.

136
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,930
I'm not sure. Three a month
right now sounds good.

137
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,620
I'm gonna keep doing that for awhile.

138
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,530
I'll do a nice compact six

139
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,060
or 10-minute lesson for you every Tuesday,

140
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,730
and I'm just gonna keep
on doing what I do.

141
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,490
I think that I'm very
comfortable doing this now.

142
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,700
I enjoy it, and the response I get

143
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,440
from all of you is really, really good.

144
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,350
I don't want to think about it too much,

145
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,990
but there is a possibility

146
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,110
my main channel might hit one
million subscribers in 2022.

147
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,570
We'll see, I think that
will be quite a day

148
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,320
if that does happen.

149
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,680
I'm fairly confident it will,
but who knows. It's YouTube.

150
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,140
Sometimes views go up and
sometimes they go down

151
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,860
and who knows what can happen,

152
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:20,400
but I'm fairly confident that
that will happen at sometime,

153
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,130
and it might even be in 2022.

154
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,040
Anyways, to wrap up, let
me check my notes here.

155
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,290
Don't worry about me
running out of topics.

156
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,610
I have 42 more ideas on my list right now.

157
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,490
So there's plenty of
ideas for lessons in 2022.

158
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,920
I do want to get out more to make lessons.

159
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,810
I do want to go places.

160
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,300
So hopefully this pandemic
goes away eventually,

161
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,250
and I can get back out to different places

162
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,370
to make English lessons out in public,

163
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,280
which I think they end up being
the best kinds of lessons.

164
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,820
Anyways, let me look
down at my notes here.

165
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,270
Anything else that I have planned?

166
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,210
Nope, I'm just gonna keep doing the same

167
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,320
as what I've been doing,

168
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,960
trying to make good English lessons

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,650
for all of you on a weekly basis.

170
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,280
So once again, I think I
should just end this video

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,660
by saying thank you.

172
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,630
If you're sitting somewhere
in your kitchen or living room

173
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,260
