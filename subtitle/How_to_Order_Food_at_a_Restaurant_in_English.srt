00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,770
Hi, Bob, the Canadian here.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,270
In this English lesson, I'm going to take
you to four different restaurants, and I'm

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,450
going to teach you four different English
phrases that you can use to order food in

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,560
English.

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,640
Well, hey, welcome to this video on ordering
food in English at a restaurant.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,070
Before we get started though, I wanted to
mention two things.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,780
Number one, if you haven't yet subscribed
to my channel, please click that red subscribe

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,780
button below.

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,500
And number two, if you're worried that
I'm going to eat all this food myself,

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,440
I'm not.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,640
My kids are eagerly waiting at home to see
what food I order and what food I bring

12
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:45,649
home today.

13
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:49,300
So, the first thing we're going to order is
a pizza.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,999
In this restaurant, I'm going to order a small
pepperoni pizza, and I'm going to use the

15
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:57,609
phrase "I would like to order."

16
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:59,829
Or the short form of it would be, "I'd like
to order."

17
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,539
So, let's go in and order a small pepperoni
pizza.

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,280
Hi, how can I help you?

19
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,680
Yes, I would like to order a small pepperoni
pizza.

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,520
Is it for pickup?

21
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,800
Yes. For pickup, please.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,820
Yep.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,520
What's your phone number?

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,900
It's 905 386-0042.

25
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,820
And your name? Bob. Bob. Yep.

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,140
What would you like to order, Bob?

27
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,440
Just a small pepperoni pizza.

28
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,300
And that's everything for today?

29
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,420
That's everything for today, yup.

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,960
So your total comes to $9.05.

31
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,180
Cash?

32
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,380
Yep.

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,460
.95 cents is your change.

34
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,470
Thank you.

35
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,660
And it will take about 15 to 20 minutes.

36
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,920
15 to 20 minutes. Okay. Thank you very much.

37
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,230
So, the next thing I thought we should order
is a hamburger and some fries.

38
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:03,440
It's a pretty classic thing to order from
a fast food restaurant.

39
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,519
And in this restaurant I will be using, the
phrase "I will have" or "I'll have."

40
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,659
I'll have is the short form of it.

41
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,360
So, let's go in and get a burger and some
fries.

42
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,880
Hi, how are you?

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,040
Good, sir. How are you?

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
Good.

45
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,599
I'll have the Teen Burger.

46
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,400
It's for here or to go, sir?

47
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,540
To go, please.

48
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,360
And the combo, please.

49
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,980
Fries and a root beer?

50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,940
Fries and root beer would be good, yup.

51
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,200
That's everything? That's everything.

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,620
And can I have a name for the order? Bob. Bob.

53
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,560
It's $11.96, sir.

54
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,460
Thank you.

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,060
Thank you very much, sir.

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,800
Thank you very much.

57
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,500
Here you go sir. The straws are over there.

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,880
Have a good day.

59
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,230
Thank you very much. See you.

60
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,919
Well, we're done here.

61
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:07,109
We got a burger and some fries.

62
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,560
And the drink I got is a root beer.

63
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,569
So, let's head to the next place.

64
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:16,700
So, the next thing I thought we should order
is a sub.

65
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
In this restaurant.

66
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,180
I'll use the phrase, "Could I have" to order
my sub.

67
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm not sure what sub I'm getting yet.

68
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,620
We'll see when we get in there.

69
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,189
Alright, what would you like?

70
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:32,400
Could I have a cold cut combo?

71
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:33,409
Sure.

72
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:34,409
Which bread?

73
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,409
Whole wheat bread.

74
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:36,409
Foot long?

75
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,489
A foot long, please, yes.

76
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,090
Thank you.

77
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,470
Toasted?

78
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,680
Not toasted.

79
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,900
White cheddar, orange or swiss?

80
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,060
Orange cheddar, please.

81
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,500
What would you like on that?

82
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:57,060
Some tomatoes, some spinach, and some cucumbers,
please.

83
00:03:57,069 --> 00:03:59,040
Is there anything else?

84
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,680
Yeah, is there a combo?

85
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Yes.

86
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,920
Yeah. Could we make that a combo?

87
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,500
Would you like cookies or chips?

88
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,600
Cookies, please.

89
00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:08,609
Alrighty.

90
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:09,609
You get two, which...

91
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,760
Two chocolate chip.

92
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,700
Do you want a fountain drink or a bottle today?

93
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,300
Fountain drink.

94
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Medium size?

95
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Yes.

96
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,560
That'll be $12.05. From $15?

97
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,420
$2.95.

98
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,400
Thank you very much.

99
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,600
Would you like a receipt today?

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,460
No receipt, no.

101
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,300
Thank you.

102
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,280
You're welcome.

103
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,360
So, I got my sub.

104
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,300
Now I just need to fill up my own drink over
here.

105
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,760
So, I'm here at Tim Hortons, of course.

106
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,740
The last thing I'm going to order today is
a half dozen donuts.

107
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,070
So, my kids will have something to eat for
dessert.

108
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm going to use the phrase, "Could I get"
to order the food that I need.

109
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,440
Hi, could I get six donuts?

110
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,700
Do you need to know what kind?

111
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,960
You can just choose them, if you want, like after you pay.

112
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Yep, so that sounds good.

113
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,050
That's it.

114
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,050
That's it?

115
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,050
Yep.

116
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,050
Do you have a rewards card today?

117
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,050
Nope.

118
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,050
And is that cash or debit.

119
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,040
Debit.

120
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,160
I have to let them know which donuts I want.

121
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,800
So, I'll have a chocolate dip.

122
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,800
There's one right here, I think.

123
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:49,340
Boston cream, vanilla dip, a maple dip, a
classic sour cream, and another Boston cream.

124
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,520
Here you go. Awesome. Thank you. Have a good day.

125
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,900
I think of all the stuff I bought today,
this is going to be my kids' favorite, for

126
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
sure.

127
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,560
So, I actually almost forgot that I have to
pick up the pizza yet.

128
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,490
So, we're back at the pizza shop, and I'm
going to go in and get my small pepperoni

129
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:08,490
pizza.

130
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,650
Hi, small pizza for Bob.

131
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,760
Yep, it's ready.

132
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,640
Excellent.

133
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Thank you very much.

134
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,860
So, I got the pizza and our little trip is
almost done.

135
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,110
But there's one more stop, actually.

136
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,750
So, I was almost done making the video, and
Jen texted me and asked if I could get her

137
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,380
a peppermint tea from Tim Hortons.

138
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:34,240
Hi, Hortons, may I help you? Yeah. Could I get a large peppermint tea?

139
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,400
Anything else? Nope.

140
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,180
That's everything.

141
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,440
All right. $2.00, come on up.

142
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,460
Thank you. You're welcome.

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,620
Peppermint tea, black?

144
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,280
Is it a $1?

145
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,480
It's $2.02, so $2.00. $2.02.

146
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,840
There you go. Do you have a rewards card? 
 No.

147
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,120
That's all right. Here you go.

148
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,780
Thank you. Have a good day. You, too.

149
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,740
One really big cup of peppermint tea for Jen.

150
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,990
And now I think I'm done.

151
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,900
Well, hey, that was four ways to order food
in English.

152
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:08,490
I hope that you learned a few new English
phrases today.

153
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,810
Bob the Canadian, here.

154
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,930
You are learning English with Bob the Canadian.
