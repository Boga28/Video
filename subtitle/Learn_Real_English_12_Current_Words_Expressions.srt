00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,930
Hi, everybody. Welcome to
www.engvid.com. I'm Adam. In

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,290
today's lesson, we're going to
look at some popular culture

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,880
expressions. These are words
that are very popular today;

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,200
they may or may not be popular
in a few years. Right? And the

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,050
reason that it's important to
understand these is because

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,310
you're going to see or hear
these words a lot now, but

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,400
they're not words that are very
common, or they're not words

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,090
that you would see in an English
learning textbook, for example.

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,860
They are words that suddenly
appear in mainstream media, or

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,040
in, like, Hollywood, or in
things like that -- that

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,630
basically celebrities, or
influencers, or people who are

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,340
popular and have a big audience
make common. Right? So, these

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,150
are not everyday words; these
are words that somebody made

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,880
popular. Okay? And we're going
to.  You're going to have an

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,620
idea once I get going.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,570
For example: "to throw shade at
someone". Ten years ago, you

17
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,500
would not have heard this
expression. Ten years from now,

18
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,100
you might not hear this
expression anymore. But today,

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,250
this is a very common
expression. "To throw shade"

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,320
means to insult someone
publicly. But the key is that

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,000
it's not a very obvious insult;
it's a very subtle or very

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,740
hinted-at insult. And it's
usually celebrities at

23
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,120
celebrities. Because who is in
the public eye? Celebrities.

24
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,440
Everyday people, like you or me,
nobody cares what we actually

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,170
say. So, nobody's listening to
us, so we can't really throw

26
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,890
shade in public. We can do it in
private, but then it's just

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,390
insult; it's not shade.

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,290
Now, the main idea is that it's
shade. "Shade" means "not

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,750
direct". Right? So, if.  If one
musician makes a joke, but

30
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,880
doesn't mention the.  another
musician's name, but the nature

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,850
of the joke everybody
understands is about that

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,600
musician, then that is called
"throwing shade". The first

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,800
musician could directly insult
to the second musician, but she

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,130
doesn't. She says something that
everybody understands to be

35
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:15,150
about the second musician, and
therefore she can't be blamed,

36
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,200
really, for anything. Although
it usually goes back and forth

37
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,270
both ways. Okay? So, to insult
in a very subtle but public way.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,590
"Gaslighting", this is a very
common expression. This is

39
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,120
actually an old expression, but
it's become popular again, in

40
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,930
the new political,
American-political situation.

41
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,810
You'll hear it more commonly in
the US than you will other

42
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,430
places, but "to gaslight
someone".  So, one person can

43
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,270
"gaslight" someone or a person
can "gaslight" a whole group of

44
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,250
people. It basically means "to
manipulate". But how? How do you

45
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,800
manipulate people? You lie to
them, or you make them think

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,490
that they.  their reality is
questionable.

47
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,930
So, if I tell you lies every
day, every day, every day, and

48
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:10,560
then you question me, and I
would say: "What are you talking

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,220
about? I never said that." So, I
tell you the lie, and then I

50
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,510
deny it. And then I again, and
again, and again, until finally,

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,690
you start to think that maybe
the problem is in your mind; you

52
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,010
start to doubt yourself, you
start to think that your reality

53
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,810
might not be 100% accurate, or
you start questioning what is

54
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,590
actually true and what is not.
You don't know what to believe,

55
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,370
who to believe, etcetera. So,
the person who did this to you

56
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,810
gaslighted you or gaslit you,
and that's the whole intention

57
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,040
of it. So, especially in the
political environment we live in

58
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:56,910
today. Some politicians are
actively trying to gaslight the

59
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,110
public; they lie to them, lie to
them, and they say: "No. I never

60
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,650
said that." Or: "No, no, I said
the opposite. I don't know why

61
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:07,440
you think this." Right? So,
they're manipulating them. And

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,860
it's working, which is a scary
thing. So, that's "gaslighting".

63
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,769
"Trigger". "Trigger" is a very
popular word now as well. When

64
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,839
someone is triggered, it means
something got them emotionally

65
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,770
active; it made them somehow
emotional, usually in a negative

66
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:29,580
way. So, somebody said
something, and that made me very

67
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,320
angry, and maybe it offended me.
It made me feel attacked or

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,620
insulted. And then I get very
angry and I want to take some

69
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,440
action. This is also very common
in the political landscape these

70
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,980
days, especially in the US,
where if someone triggers

71
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,900
someone, the.  It makes them
angry, but sometimes.  It's

72
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,340
gotten to the point where the
person getting angry is getting

73
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:02,190
angry about everything. Right?
So, the political right is

74
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,900
accusing the political left of
always being triggered, which

75
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,620
leads. 

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,940
Actually, I'll go.  I'll skip a
few and go to this word:

77
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,380
"snowflake". So, the political
right, started calling people on

78
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,610
the left "snowflakes" because
"snowflakes".  Basically,

79
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,150
"snowflake" means somebody who's
not really special. Right? He's

80
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:25,210
just like everybody else. But
now it means that somebody who

81
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,460
gets easily offended. So, a lot
of people accused the liberals

82
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,300
in the US of being snowflakes.
It's very easy to make them

83
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,860
upset; it's very easy to offend
them. They're always trying to

84
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,520
be politically correct, trying
to make everybody happy, which

85
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,720
is a little bit impossible. So,
it's gotten to the point where

86
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,010
people on, like, on the left. 
on the right, like Republicans,

87
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,820
are actively and happily trying
to trigger the snowflakes on the

88
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,800
left. And the problem is that
the liberals, the Democrats are

89
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,100
starting to look a little bit
weak, because everybody thinks

90
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,120
they are snowflakes.

91
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,680
So, I'll give you a common
example these days. It's

92
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,600
becoming increasingly popular
for people to say what pronoun

93
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:21,460
they want to be called by. So:
"Hi. My name is Adam. I prefer

94
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,080
'he' and 'him'." So, like,
basically, I'm saying I'm a

95
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,320
male, so call me by my male
pronouns. Some people say they

96
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,200
prefer to be called "they".
People don't want to be

97
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,770
gender.  They want to be. 
They don't want to be

98
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,280
gender-binary; they want to be
neutral. So, anyways, this is

99
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,470
one of the things that people
are talking about. If you call

100
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,680
somebody, if somebody says:
"'He'. I want to be called 'he'

101
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,460
or 'she'", and you call me
"they", I will be triggered, I

102
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,150
will be angry, and I will
complain and I will be upset

103
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,270
about it. And then you will call
me a "snowflake" because I'm

104
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,560
getting upset about nothing
really serious. So, "snowflake"

105
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,240
and "triggers" kind of go
together.

106
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,750
Now, a "snub". A "snub" is
basically ignoring something or

107
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,860
someone a little bit with the
intent of making them feel bad.

108
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,180
So, if you think about the
Oscars, the movies or any award

109
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,830
show -- somebody is getting a
lot of praise for their acting,

110
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,100
or directing, or production. And
everybody thinks: "Oh, yeah,

111
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,060
this.  This actor is going to
win an Academy Award." And then

112
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,830
the Oscar committee announces
the nominations, who is

113
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:36,820
considered to be the best actor,
and they snub this actor. It

114
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,840
means they don't include him in
the nominations. That means they

115
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,720
ignore him; they think his, that
his performance was not very

116
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,820
good. So, a "snub" can be
considered an insult. But mostly

117
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,360
it means you're not included or
not considered for something,

118
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,970
and people take offense to that
as well.

119
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,970
I'm sure if you follow Instagram
or social media, you've probably

120
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:04,080
seen "BAE" a lot. A lot of
people think that "BAE" is short

121
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,430
for "baby". Actually, it's an
acronym: Before Anyone Else. So,

122
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,460
basically, your special person.
You will do something for this

123
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:19,230
person before anyone else. So,
it could be baby, your baby, but

124
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,620
it's basically your boyfriend or
girlfriend, the.  Or your

125
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,420
lover. Doesn't.  depends on the
situation. "Before Anyone Else"

126
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,210
is the actual expression.

127
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,910
"Ghost". This is actually a
verb: "to ghost". So, "to ghost"

128
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,900
means, for example, in a
party.  If you're at a party

129
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,140
and you leave without saying:
"Goodbye" to anybody, like,

130
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,080
nobody knows that you left.
Suddenly, they realize you're

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,190
not there -- that means you
ghosted; you left quietly

132
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,840
without telling anybody. Or on a
conversation, on a telephone

133
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,760
conversation, someone calls you
and your friend picks up and you

134
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,160
say: "Hello?" You say. 
Somebody says: "Yeah. Can I talk

135
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,650
to Bill?" And Bill is standing
right here. It means I'm not

136
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,290
here. Right? So, they say: "Oh,
I'm sorry. Bill's not here. Can

137
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,800
he call you back?" So that Bill
is ghosting the person on the

138
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,720
phone. That's another use of it.

139
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,770
And if you have a relationship
with someone, you're talking or

140
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:24,270
texting, whatever, and then
suddenly one person just stops

141
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,660
communication; never writes
back, never calls -- just stops

142
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,350
any communication. So. that,
also, is called "ghosting".

143
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,900
That's a common expression these
days.

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,470
Another thing to keep in mind
about most of these expressions,

145
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,640
like, for example: "BAE", and
"ghost", and things like that --

146
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,730
young people use it more than
the older generations.

147
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,110
"Trigger", "snowflake", and
"gaslighting" -- these are just

148
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,700
more of political words and
expressions, so everybody's

149
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,770
using them. But a lot of the
pop-culture words originate or

150
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,020
come with.  from young people.

151
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,980
Now, then an example here is the
word "woke". This is actually an

152
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:11,620
old word, but it has a
resurgence. Basically, it's a

153
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,380
word that's become popular and
then sort of disappears, nobody

154
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,830
uses it; and then it comes back
to be popular, and maybe

155
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,950
disappears again. So, this is
basically, like, now the third

156
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,530
time that it's become popular.
"Woke" means aware; socially

157
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,880
aware of discrimination or
injustice, especially when it

158
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,420
comes to, like, racial
discrimination. If you think

159
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,270
you're being discriminated
against, or if you notice that

160
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,600
there's a lot of discrimination
against people of color; Black

161
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,480
people, Latinos, etcetera - then
you are "woke".

162
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,490
And generally, if you're going
to be woke, you're probably also

163
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,970
going to be "triggered". Right?
I'm actually going to say

164
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,050
"triggered" when we're talking
about a person or describing a

165
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:00,640
person. "To trigger" means to
make someone triggered. And if

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,900
someone is woke, they can be
easily upset; they can be easily

167
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,240
triggered by seeing how, let's
say, police treat a certain

168
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:14,080
segment of the population, or
how the government treats them,

169
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,080
or how anybody. Like, any one
area the population treats

170
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,290
another area of the population,
especially as the world is

171
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:26,470
becoming.  There's a lot more
White supremacy, and populism,

172
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,730
and all these things. People are
becoming more woke. Okay?

173
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,810
On a more light tone, we have
"GOAT". "GOAT" is also an

174
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:43,170
acronym; it's not the animal, it
means: Greatest Of All Time.

175
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,760
Greatest Of All Time. So, it
started.  The conversation

176
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,840
started, I think. It became more
and more popular when there was

177
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,830
a question: "Who is the GOAT?
LeBron James or Michael Jordan?

178
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:59,940
Who is the greatest basketball
player of all time?" And after

179
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,640
they started, then: "Okay, who's
the GOAT in hockey? Who's the

180
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,450
GOAT in soccer? Who's the goat
in football?" And then it

181
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,300
started to go outside of sports
altogether: "Who's the GOAT

182
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,780
president? Who's the GOAT
businessman?" All these things.

183
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,280
So: "Who's the best? The best of
the best. The Greatest Of All

184
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,120
Time." And it's used quite a lot
these days.

185
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:25,950
"Goals". "Goals", basically
means "goals"; it's exactly what

186
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,880
it says, but it's very commonly
used when people talk about what

187
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,800
they want to achieve. And you'll
see this a lot on social media.

188
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,670
Right? Somebody puts a picture
of a happy couple and they're

189
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,850
doing something fun, and in the
comments, you'll see: "Oh,

190
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,240
couple goals". Or they're. 
They have very nice body; body

191
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,280
goals, or vacation goals, or
whatever goals. So, whenever

192
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,130
people see something that they
think is really good and they

193
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,690
want for themselves, instead of
actually working towards it,

194
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,110
they'll just say: "Oh, body
goals, couple goals. I want to

195
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,010
be like them." So, that's
actually what it means: "I want

196
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,000
to be like", and whatever you're
talking about. And notice that

197
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,720
it's not "goal"; it's always
"goals". "Body goals, vacation

198
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,830
goals, couple goals". A very
common word these days,

199
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,360
especially on social media.

200
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,920
"To binge". "To binge" means to
do a lot of something in a very

201
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,390
short time. So, for example, if
you.  If you like the

202
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,860
Friends.  The TV show, Friends,
for example and you.  You

203
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,470
want.  You don't have much
time, but you want to see all of

204
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,950
the shows, one day you will
start and you will watch one

205
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,190
after the other, after the
other. And after a day or two,

206
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:49,980
you've seen the entire series.
You binged on the show. It's

207
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,790
also commonly used for when we
talk about drinking alcohol, and

208
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,150
especially young people at
university, and they have

209
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,020
parties and they binge drink.
So, we can also use it as an

210
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,000
adjective. "Binge drinking"
means drinking a lot; a huge

211
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,290
quantity in a short time, which
is very dangerous when it comes

212
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:13,620
to alcohol. You can get very
sick; you can even die from

213
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,420
alcohol poisoning. But doing
anything in a huge quantity in a

214
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,820
short time is called "binging".

215
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,700
And "meme". "Meme" should be
more or less popular; common to

216
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,370
a lot of people, but just in
case: A "meme" is a very popular

217
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,530
picture, or expression, or movie
scene, or.  Or piece of music

218
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:41,120
that becomes so popular that
people take it and manipulate it

219
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,780
into other situations. So, if
you have a movie scene and it's

220
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,160
really funny or really strange,
people will take that scene and

221
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,390
they will Photoshop it or they
will add text, change the text

222
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,680
to fit it to other situations.
And you'll see this a lot in,

223
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,370
like, Twitter or Instagram.
People take a situation and

224
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,600
everybody makes a different
version of it to make fun of it.

225
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:09,560
Because it's so popular,
everyone recognizes the picture,

226
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,180
or the text, or whatever it is.
So, that's called a "meme". And

227
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,930
it's usually pictures of people
in different situations, but it

228
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,940
doesn't have to be that. Okay?

229
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,530
Now, the main thing to remember,
here, is that these words may go

230
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,630
out of fashion; people may stop
using them. But for now, for the

231
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,320
foreseeable future, it's good
for you to understand what. 

232
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,870
What they mean and how they're
used.

233
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,830
But, anyway, if you're not sure

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,760

237
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,400
