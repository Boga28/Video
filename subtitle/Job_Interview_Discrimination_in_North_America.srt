1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,100
Hi. My name is Ronnie, and I'd like to
share a little story with you. So, nice;

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,750
story time with Ronnie. I lived four
years in Japan — beautiful country,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,350
wonderful people, good mountains — and
one thing that really shocked me was the

4
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:24,419
job-interview process, and the amount of
information that people were asked and

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,460
give in job interviews.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:30,780
So, for example, in Japan, I remember on
resumes, people had to give their

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:38,370
picture, their age, maybe their marital
status. And I found this to be very

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,550
strange, because in Canada and in North
America, this just can't.  just don't

9
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:49,890
give your picture. Because I'm sure that
people will judge you on your appearance

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,270
in a job interview. Even just looking at
your resume, like: "Well, this one's

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,680
gorgeous — let's hire him." You can't do
that. And we have really strict laws

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,650
about this in North America, so I'm here
to walk you through some.

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,290
You have to be aware that there are many
questions that the interviewer cannot

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:19,080
ask you; based on race, age, gender,
appearance. There's also the problem

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,950
that you have to know enough not to talk
about them yourself. So, for example, if

16
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,650
you're a new mother — congratulations,
you just had a baby — and you're going

17
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:39,030
for a job interview, don't mention the
baby. Okay? It's not illegal to say that

18
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,410
you don't have a baby or say you have a
baby, but it's just a very dodgy subject

19
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,770
to talk about at a job interview. It
makes you look very unprofessional.

20
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,620
You're there to talk about your job, and
you getting a new job; not about your

21
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,920
newborn baby. So, you have to watch out
for professionalism.

22
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,680
If you get involved in talking about
things that are or can be seen as

23
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,830
discriminatory, not a good situation.
You have to watch out for legal issues.

24
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:15,390
And you have to be aware that the
standards in North America might be very

25
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,160
different from your country. They could
be similar, but they could be very

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,750
different. So, pay attention, make sure
you know the game before you run it.

27
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,120
Mm-hmm. Run the race. Practice.

28
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,800
So, discrimination based upon gender.
"What do you identify as?" They're not

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,450
allowed to ask your sex. "Who do you
live with?" Again, trying to determine

30
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:48,360
your gender can be caused as
discrimination or can be looked at as

31
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,580
discrimination. "How are you related to
the people you work with?" Again, it

32
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,710
seems that these questions are leading
to: "What's your gender?" which, again,

33
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:03,510
is discrimination. They cannot
discriminate against you based on you're

34
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,410
a male, you're a female, you're. 
choose to identify with whatever you

35
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,450
choose. It's just wrong.

36
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,670
Also, they cannot discriminate against
you based on appearance. As I mentioned

37
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,800
to you in Japan, and I know in Korea as
well, you put a picture on your resume.

38
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,450
And I know people are sitting there,
going: "Nah, this one. Nah. Oh, this

39
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,400
one's cute. Let's hire her. Whoa, look
at this guy's eyes. Let's hire him." You

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,890
cannot do this. Appearance. You're not
allowed to talk about how much you

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:46,110
weigh, your height; unless it is very,
very specific to the job. If you're

42
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,250
going for a job for the tallest person
in the world, they can ask you your

43
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,600
height. But if it's a general question,
if you have to meet some height

44
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,690
requirement, they can ask you: "Do you
measure up to six-two?" or "Are you

45
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,280
taller than three point five?" if it's
required for the job. It's very

46
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,300
important to stress that. "Do you have
any disabilities?" If this is brought

47
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,640
up, again, it can be seen as
discrimination. "Are you pregnant?"

48
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,870
Never, ever ask a woman if she's
pregnant. Okay? I don't care what social

49
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,470
situation you're in, but especially in a
job interview — again, it can be seen as

50
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,670
discrimination.

51
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,680
We have age discrimination. So,
depending on how old or young someone

52
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,430
is, they could be denied a job; again,
unless it's a legal requirement. In

53
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,740
Canada, if you're under 18 years of. 
of age, you cannot work in a bar

54
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,450
legally, so they can ask you: -"Are you
of legal age to work in Canada in a

55
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,790
bar?" -"Yes." That's perfect. They can't
ask you specifically how old you are.

56
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,890
"When's your birthday?" No. "What year
were you born? What year did you

57
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,650
graduate?" If they know what year you
graduated, and they're good in math,

58
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,260
they're going to know your age. Maybe
they are concerned about someone being

59
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,480
too old for a job, or too young for a
job, which is that way. "When did you

60
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,700
get your first job?" Mathematically,
they can figure out how old you are. So,

61
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,330
these questions — very, very dangerous.
Be careful.

62
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,800
As far as availability goes, your
schedule; scheduling. So, they're not

63
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,660
allowed to ask you if you can work on
evenings or weekends. That seems

64
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:58,800
strange. Why? Because this gets into
religion and your marital status. "Do

65
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,200
you have children?" They can't ask you
that. It doesn't matter what religion

66
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,760
you are, you can't talk about that; it's
not their business. Working at night,

67
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:14,730
working evenings, working in weekends
can kind of determine your religion.

68
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,840
Marital status — married, single,
divorced, widowed — none of their

69
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,570
business; not allowed to give that
information.

70
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,250
And this is a huge one: "Are you
planning to have a family?" I know, in

71
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,940
Japan, if you were planning to have a
family or you were pregnant, they would

72
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,510
not hire some people because they
thought that they weren't loyal to the

73
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,470
company; they would just work there for
a little bit, get pregnant and leave.

74
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:51,210
Also, when I was in Japan about 10 years
ago, when women actually were pregnant

75
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:57,990
and had children, some companies didn't
allow them to work anymore. Oh, hello.

76
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,230
In North America, this is very, very
wrong. They cannot do that to you.

77
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:12,570
Another big thing is your ability to
work. "Do you have a work visa?" Okay?

78
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,050
They can ask you that. But they can't
ask you about your citizenship or your

79
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:20,490
background, your parents. They can't ask
you to see a birth certificate because

80
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,620
where you were born has nothing to do
with you getting a job. They can't ask

81
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,840
you to see citizenship papers. They can
ask you for a work visa or work permit,

82
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,280
because that's the law, but they can't
ask you about anything about your

83
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,260
family. Oh, it says: "Why do you speak
French?" Hmm. Why do you want to know if

84
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:49,050
I speak French? This has to do with
discrimination on a citizenship level.

85
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,870
It's not your business why I speak
French, unless of course, you are

86
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:01,110
applying for a job as a French-English
translator or a French teacher. Hmm.

87
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,980
Maybe this is an appropriate question to
ask.

88
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:12,670
So, I highly suggest that you know, with
the back of your hand — that's an

89
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:19,930
expression — what things are okay to be
talked about in a job interview, even on

90
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,680
your part. Because if you start going
off: "Oh yeah, you know, I was born here

91
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,230
and. " Oh, you've given them too much
information. So, please be careful. But

92
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:33,700
good luck out there. You can get this
job. Just know your rights.
