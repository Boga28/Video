00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:04,660
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,700
I was thinking about going, but I don't know.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,490
What do you think?

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:11,490
What?

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,920
Let's talk about it.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,380
When you're learning English and hey, sometimes
as a native English speaker, there will be

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,160
times when you won't understand what someone
else says and you'll want them to repeat themselves.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,779
But it's rude to say, "Huh?

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,779
What?"

10
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:34,980
So in today's lesson, you're going to learn
some wonderful alternatives when you want

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,449
someone to repeat themselves so that you can
accurately understand what they're saying.

12
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:44,250
To help you with this lesson, I've created
a free PDF worksheet so that you will never

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,940
forget what you've learned.

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,590
Plus, you can answer Vanessa's challenge question
at the end of the PDF.

15
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,519
You can download it with the link in the description.

16
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:59,010
All right, let's get started with eight casual
phrases for when you want someone to repeat

17
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,079
themselves, but you don't want to say, huh?

18
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,078
What?

19
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:05,078
Let's start.

20
00:01:05,078 --> 00:01:07,770
Phrase number one is, sorry?

21
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,030
Oh, this is so polite, and it is a great one
word alternative instead of saying, what?

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,780
When you say, sorry, this is extremely kind.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,680
And it just means, hey, I didn't understand
what you said.

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,750
Maybe the environment is too noisy.

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,799
Maybe there's a rooster crowing in the background,
or maybe you just didn't get a word that they

26
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,640
said, or the topic was too complicated.

27
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,640
Great.

28
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,640
What can you say?

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Sorry?

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,060
And you'll notice that we say the word sorry
in front of a lot of the next expressions

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,060
too.

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,060
Let's go to number two.

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,520
Sorry, what'd you say?

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,509
Oh, this is excellent, especially if you weren't
paying attention completely.

35
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,680
Maybe you were working on something.

36
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,950
You were looking at your phone.

37
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,130
You were just off in Lalaland.

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,530
You can use this great expression.

39
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,860
Sorry, what'd you say?

40
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,220
Sorry, can you say that again?

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,649
I often use this phrase when my husband is
trying to tell me something, but I'm playing

42
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:09,340
with my two kids and we're being loud together,
or maybe they're being loud, and I just didn't

43
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,370
hear what he said.

44
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,310
Maybe I could have said, huh?

45
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,310
What?

46
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,980
But that's not very polite.

47
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,190
Instead, I can say, and I often do, sorry,
can you say that again?

48
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,320
Excellent.

49
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,390
What was that?

50
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:28,970
Oh, what was that is a great question to ask
when you just didn't catch what someone was

51
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,970
saying.

52
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,730
Maybe it's a little bit surprising, some kind
of information.

53
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,460
They're talking, they're talking, and then
they say, "Oh yeah, and then I'm getting married

54
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,900
next weekend."

55
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
What was that?

56
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,500
Oh, you want them to repeat themselves, but
you want to ask them in a nice way.

57
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Excellent phrase.

58
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:50,020
The next three phrases are used in extremely
casual situations, so I don't recommend using

59
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,129
these at work.

60
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:56,050
You can use them with friends, with family
you feel comfortable with, and they're often

61
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,410
used regionally in the US.

62
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,970
The first one is, come again?

63
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:07,099
When you ask someone, come again, it's because
you maybe didn't hear them.

64
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,550
But more likely you heard them correctly,
but you were kind of surprised by what they

65
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,350
said, so you want them to repeat it.

66
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,099
You can say, "Okay.

67
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:17,459
Yeah, you did say that."

68
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,510
Let me give you a quick example.

69
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,040
If you're talking with your good friend and
then your good friend mentions, "Oh yeah,

70
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,379
I'm moving to Japan next week."

71
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,770
Come again?

72
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,019
This is shocking information.

73
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,120
You had no idea that your friend was going
to move to Japan.

74
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,760
So you want her to repeat herself, and you
can use this great phrase, come again?

75
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,680
You're not moving to Japan.

76
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,560
No, you can't move to Japan.

77
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,560
Stay with me.

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,310
It's a great phrase to use.

79
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,930
A similar phrase that's also casual is, how's
that?

80
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,650
We often use this in the similar situations
when we either don't understand, or we want

81
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,269
someone to repeat themselves for clarity.

82
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,480
You might ask, how's that?

83
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,140
And to make it even more casual, you can say,
do what?

84
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,629
This is something that I use often.

85
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm not sure why.

86
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,879
Maybe it's something that's common in the
South of the US where I live, but it's when

87
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
you want someone to repeat themselves.

88
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,760
But I use it when someone says something that
I'm surprised by.

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,060
You're moving to Japan?

90
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,060
Do what?

91
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,050
It doesn't mean that they're doing something,
but it just means that you're surprised by

92
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,520
what they said.

93
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,200
Along with, do what, we have, say what?

94
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,230
It just means they said something that you
want them to repeat.

95
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,280
Maybe you didn't understand, or maybe it was
a little surprising and you might answer with,

96
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,290
say what?

97
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,380
No, you can't move to Japan.

98
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,980
Don't move to Japan.

99
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,890
Say what?

100
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,250
The last casual phrase is, sorry, one more
time?

101
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,230
I use this phrase if I'm in a noisy restaurant
and I've already asked someone to repeat themselves

102
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,790
a couple of times, or maybe I just wasn't
paying attention and I feel a little bit bad

103
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,040
that I'm asking them again to repeat themselves.

104
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,070
So if you've already said, sorry, can you
say that again?

105
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,310
Sorry, I didn't hear you?

106
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,200
Sorry, one more time?

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,080
This is like your final request.

108
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,910
Sorry, one more time?

109
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,910
Very nice.

110
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,910
All right.

111
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,830
Let's go to some professional expressions
that you can use instead of, huh, what, when

112
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,600
you want someone to repeat themselves.

113
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,280
Sorry, I didn't catch what you said.

114
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,830
Sorry, I didn't catch what you said.

115
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:35,240
This verb, to catch, means that we can imagine
a word is running away and you can't catch

116
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
it.

117
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,800
You can't understand it.

118
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,100
We often use that word catch when we're talking
about conversations and maybe missing a word

119
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,810
or missing a phrase.

120
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,620
This is a great question that you can use.

121
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,320
Sorry, I didn't catch what you said.

122
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,500
Can you repeat that, please?

123
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,500
Excellent.

124
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,380
Can you run that by me again?

125
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,130
Can you run that by me again?

126
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,640
We often use this if someone said something
long or confusing.

127
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,680
Maybe you're talking about a technical concept
in your business and it's just long and confusing.

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,740
There's lots of parts.

129
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,620
Well, you could say, can you run that by me
again?

130
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,160
I want to make sure I understood everything.

131
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,860
Can you run that by me again?

132
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,970
Could you rephrase that for me?

133
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,320
Could you rephrase that for me?

134
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,330
The word rephrase means that you're saying
the same thing, but with different words.

135
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:28,540
And this is excellent, especially for English
learners.

136
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,780
But hey, really for everyone.

137
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,930
Because sometimes the way that someone explains
something is confusing, or maybe they use

138
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,000
a word that you just don't know yet, or it's
something that you're not familiar with.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Great.

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,290
How can you understand it?

141
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,830
You need to have that rephrased for you.

142
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,990
So you can use this question, can you rephrase
that for me please?

143
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,130
Excellent.

144
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,660
When you say, do you mean?

145
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,690
This is a great question to make sure you
actually understood exactly what they're talking

146
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,690
about.

147
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,190
You can use this in general situations, but
it's great to use in professional situations

148
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:10,230
if there's some kind of lingo that's specific
to your field and maybe you're not completely

149
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,650
familiar with it.

150
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:17,990
So if someone uses a word, when you say that
technical word, do you mean?

151
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,780
And you can explain it a little bit more.

152
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,450
You can rephrase it and they'll say, "Oh yeah,
that's what I mean," or they might say, "Oh

153
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,620
no, I meant this."

154
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,160
And it's a great way to kind of check for
clarity.

155
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,990
You can even use this in daily life.

156
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,580
If your friend says, "Hey, let's meet up at
the park," you could say, "When you say park,

157
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,770
do you mean Central Park?"

158
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,160
If you're in New York City, there's a lot
of parks, so you need to check for clarity.

159
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,450
You could ask, "When you say park, do you
mean Central Park?"

160
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,740
And they might say, "Oh no, I meant this other
park."

161
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,740
Great.

162
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,650
Well, now you know what they're saying?

163
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,810
Could you be more specific, please?

164
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,810
Great.

165
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,700
This is often used in a professional situation
if someone's giving a lot of hypothetical

166
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:05,040
ideas and you need to know how this will apply
to the company, how this will apply to your

167
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,420
specific situation.

168
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
So great.

169
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,650
You can ask, can you be more specific, please?

170
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:15,390
Another common professional word is, can you
elaborate on that?

171
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,960
Elaborate, wonderful word, and this means
to give more details.

172
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,970
Instead of just saying a couple simple things,
I need to know exactly how this will fit into

173
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,750
our company or into the situation we're talking
about.

174
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,960
Can you elaborate on that?

175
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
Oh, lovely.

176
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,299
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

177
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,799
Oh, when you say the full phrase, I'm sorry,
it just kind of levels up the politeness.

178
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,219
You can say, sorry, can you repeat that?

179
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,220
That's no problem.

180
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,700
But if you want to kind of level up the politeness,
you can say, I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

181
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,820
And it means you really care what the other
person has to say, and you want to know what

182
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,710
they're saying, so you're asking them to repeat
themselves.

183
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,860
Do not feel bad asking this question.

184
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,870
It is excellent and important, and it shows
the other person, I really care.

185
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,580
I'm sorry, can you repeat that please?

186
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,890
Let's say someone says something a little
confusing, a little long, maybe something

187
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,990
that you're not exactly clear about, but you
don't want to ask them to repeat themselves.

188
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:20,790
Well, you can check your understanding by
saying this phrase, let me make sure I understand

189
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,170
this right.

190
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:27,680
You're going to rephrase what they said with
your own understanding.

191
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,960
Let me make sure I understand this right.

192
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,890
You're going to call the marketing department
tomorrow and then get in touch with the client.

193
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,980
You're going to rephrase what they just told
you, and you're not asking them to repeat

194
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
themselves.

195
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,680
It's just another alternative instead of making
them repeat.

196
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,950
Our final professional phrase before we talk
about two that you need to be very careful

197
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,190
with is, just to clarify.

198
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,260
This is similar to our previous expression
where you're going to be the one rephrasing

199
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,440
what they said.

200
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,050
You want to check that you understood everything
correctly, and maybe there are some parts

201
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,110
that you didn't get completely.

202
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:07,280
You can use this phrase, just to clarify,
you're calling the marketing department, not

203
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,020
me, right?

204
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,400
You want to make sure that the action that
you heard is what's actually going to happen.

205
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Warning!

206
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Warning!

207
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Warning!

208
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,440
Be very careful.

209
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,800
The next two phrases that I'm going to share
with you are commonly used, but they have

210
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,730
two distinct differences.

211
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,860
One can be used in a polite way, and one can
be extremely rude.

212
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,110
So make sure that you listen carefully to
the differences between how you say these

213
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,330
expressions.

214
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,630
The first one is, I beg your pardon?

215
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,630
Oh, okay.

216
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,800
This is kind of old fashioned English, but
people definitely still use this in daily

217
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,730
life if it is with a positive tone.

218
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,270
No negativity in your face.

219
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,540
No negativity in your voice.

220
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,360
Someone says something quickly and you just
didn't catch it and you say, I beg your pardon?

221
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Okay.

222
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,830
In a professional situation like that, very
neutrally.

223
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,930
It's okay.

224
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,960
But sometimes this phrase can be extremely
rude.

225
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,920
If someone says, "Oh yeah, I ate the last
piece of cake."

226
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,420
You could say, "I beg your pardon?"

227
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,410
Oh, do you see my face?

228
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,550
Watch again.

229
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,630
I beg your pardon?

230
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,290
You're not trying to be polite really.

231
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,680
You're trying to express shock.

232
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
What?

233
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
What did you say?

234
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
You ate the last piece of cake?

235
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,810
But I want the last piece of cake.

236
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,110
Could you have at least shared it with me?

237
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,340
I beg your pardon?

238
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:39,740
Oh, so you want them to repeat themselves,
but you're kind of angry about the situation.

239
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,240
So make sure if you use this expression, use
it with the right tone, in neutral tone, or

240
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,540
this angry tone if you want to convey that.

241
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:54,550
And if someone says it to you, now hopefully
you can pick up which tone they're using so

242
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,040
that you can understand their real meaning.

243
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,470
The final phrase, one that you need to be
very careful using is a simple one, excuse

244
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,470
me?

245
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,470
Okay.

246
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,870
So same as our previous expression, there's
two distinct tones that you can use when you

247
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,010
use this phrase.

248
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,160
The first is very neutral.

249
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,410
If someone says something that you just didn't
catch, it was too fast, maybe it's a noisy

250
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,790
environment, you can say, "Excuse me?

251
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,790
Excuse me?"

252
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:25,510
Okay, this is a little more neutral, and you're
just asking them to repeat themselves.

253
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,460
But it is very easy to say this in the wrong
way.

254
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:36,960
Because we often use this when we're a little
bit angry, shocked, and you want someone to

255
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,620
repeat what they said, but only because you
feel lots of negative emotion building.

256
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,600
So you might say, "Excuse me?

257
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,640
Excuse me?"

258
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,210
When someone tells you, "I ate the last piece
of cake.

259
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,040
Sorry," you can say, "Excuse me?

260
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,450
You eat the last piece of cake?

261
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,900
Uh, that was my birthday cake.

262
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,590
Excuse me?"

263
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:05,300
Do you see how there is a tone of anger, of
frustration and annoyance in my voice when

264
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
I say it?

265
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,300
So in my opinion, I think it's better to use
one of the other phrases that we just talked

266
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,610
about if you want someone to simply repeat
themselves.

267
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,910
But I want to make sure that you are empowered
with the knowledge that someone might be using

268
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,480
this towards you or other people around you
with that tone of annoyance.

269
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,910
And it sounds polite, excuse me, but it is
not polite and it's showing lots of anger.

270
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,040
Congratulations on learning many great alternatives
to saying, "Huh?

271
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
What?"

272
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,900
I hope you feel empowered to use these in
your own personal life.
