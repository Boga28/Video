1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,270
It's so easy to place people in boxes.

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,660
Drawing lines.

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:12,190
Creating sides.

4
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,440
There's us.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,930
And there's them.

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,560
Those we feel comfortable around,

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,640
And those we don't.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,240
There are those of us with many chapters.

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,299
And those just starting their own story.

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,920
There's the well to do.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,720
And those doing what they can.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,520
There are those who we share something with.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,370
And those we don't seem to share anything with.

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,820
Welcome and thank you for coming today guys.
Today I'm gonna be conducting an experiment.

15
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,570
Where I'll ask you a series of questions.

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,940
Now these questions will be very personal
questions.

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,350
And for us to get a true result I need you
to be completely honest

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,140
with how you respond.

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:09,900
The first question I have is who in here was the class clown?

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,520
Who is never on time?

21
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,880
And then.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,860
There's us.

23
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:48,100
We who have tattoos.

24
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:54,380
We who feel lonely.

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,780
We who have been bullied.

26
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:17,380
We who have bullied others.

27
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:27,200
We who are madly in love.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:45,220
We who have overcome great adversity.

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:57,080
And there's the lucky ones. Who's team won the championship this year.

30
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:25,000
We who beat cancer.

31
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,760
And then. 

32
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,580
There's all of us.

33
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:03,080
Who are created in the image of God.

34
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,940
And as one body, we stand together.

35
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,160
United as one.

36
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,020
United as one.
Under his grace.
