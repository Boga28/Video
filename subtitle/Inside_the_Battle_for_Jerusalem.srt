00:00:00,734 --> 00:00:05,906
EAST JERUSALEM

2
00:00:09,015 --> 00:00:10,705
We're on the grounds of Al Aqsa.

3
00:00:10,789 --> 00:00:13,904
It's one of the holiest
places in the Islamic religion.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:18,550
And so, we've come here, today on
one of the holiest nights of Ramadan.

5
00:00:18,634 --> 00:00:20,189
The crowds are huge.

6
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:22,102
So, if anything happens,

7
00:00:22,186 --> 00:00:25,014
it could potentially be very
dangerous to the people that are here.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,842
It's night-time prayers
for Palestinian Muslims.

9
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:32,203
And this year, Israeli forces
showed up unannounced.

10
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:38,149
If we pray until dawn,
we will be obeying God's command.

11
00:00:43,471 --> 00:00:46,288
So, you can see that there's
Israeli police actually inside,

12
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,332
in the grounds of Al Aqsa.

13
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,082
That's what triggered the protests.

14
00:00:49,159 --> 00:00:50,967
And that's what triggered the anger today.

15
00:00:51,068 --> 00:00:52,598
If your only sacrifice for Al Aqsa

16
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:55,136
is getting arrested or suffering,
that's worth it for defending it.

17
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:58,735
Palestinians feel like they're
being pushed out of East Jerusalem,

18
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,015
the city they see as the capital
of a future Palestinian state.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,567
They say Israel is upping its efforts
to redraw the borders of the city.

20
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,377
But Israel claims it belongs to them

21
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,752
despite the United Nations
saying that it's an occupation,

22
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:15,022
illegal under international law.

23
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:19,112
The Israeli police have been arresting
loads of Palestinian children.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,055
The Palestinians are retaliating

25
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,832
because so many young men
have been taken away by the police.

26
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:27,316
Stop! Stop!

27
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:29,724
Stop! Hold him!

28
00:01:29,808 --> 00:01:33,543
People just came here to worship,
and you're giving them shit!

29
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:36,084
Fuck you all!
Do what you want.

30
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:38,093
Come and arrest me!

31
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:39,298
How old are you?

32
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:40,699
How old are you?

33
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:43,122
-15 years old.
-15 years old? Why are they taking you?

34
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:48,927
God is great!

35
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,210
Why do you think they took him?

36
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:52,321
Why?

37
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:53,662
They want to keep the young people away.

38
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,947
They want to remove all
young people, one by one.

39
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:58,518
As Ramadan continued,

40
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:03,090
Palestinians in East Jerusalem faced
stun grenades, arrests, and water cannons,

41
00:02:03,464 --> 00:02:05,925
some of the worst violence seen in years.

42
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:08,727
Go away! Go away!

43
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:12,034
They sprayed us with water.

44
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,439
We were walking and not doing anything.

45
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:17,597
They're dogs and animals.

46
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:23,225
Come on, move. Don't scream.
Don't ever forget this.

47
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,344
Don't you ever forget what they did.

48
00:02:28,662 --> 00:02:32,007
East Jerusalem is important to
Jews, Muslims, and Christians.

49
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:34,971
It's also the site of the
sacred Jewish Temple Mount.

50
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:38,971
But most of the people who live in
this part of the city are Palestinians.

51
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,363
That's been slowly changing

52
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,508
since Israel captured the area in 1967

53
00:02:44,613 --> 00:02:46,643
and started moving in settlers.

54
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:51,311
Jewish people now make up
around 40 percent of the population.

55
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,241
And in 2018,

56
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,609
Israel was emboldened by President Trump.

57
00:02:55,728 --> 00:02:59,555
He moved the US Embassy
into East Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,949
It outraged Palestinians

59
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:04,388
but was celebrated by right-wing Israelis.

60
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:05,485
It is time…

61
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:09,580
to officially recognize Jerusalem…

62
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:12,610
as the capital of Israel.

63
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,459
At the heart of the fight
over East Jerusalem

64
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,705
is the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah,

65
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:20,134
home mostly to Palestinian families,

66
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:22,819
some who came here in 1956

67
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:27,303
after being displaced by Israel when
the state was created eight years earlier.

68
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,450
Israel claims Jews
historically owned this land.

69
00:03:30,548 --> 00:03:34,102
Now, there's a lawsuit to forcibly
evict some Palestinian residents

70
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:35,808
making its way through the courts.

71
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:39,155
Even if you capture, kill,
and destroy our homes,

72
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,608
you won't defeat our resolve!

73
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,825
Protesters have been turning up

74
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:47,157
since the issue reached
the Supreme Court this year.

75
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:49,159
We will take our freedom!

76
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:51,290
We will take our freedom!

77
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:57,927
The Zionist organizations seized the
first house five months after the war.

78
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:00,667
The first house they seized
back in November 1967

79
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:02,455
belonged to the Shanti family.

80
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:04,351
Muna Al Kurd and her relatives

81
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:07,931
are one of 28 families fighting
in court to keep their homes.

82
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,466
Believe me, no person from
the neighborhood will leave

83
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,332
until they drag us out
at the last moment.

84
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:16,410
We want to live! This is our house!
This is our land!

85
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:23,364
Other Palestinians are already being
replaced by right-wing Israeli settlers.

86
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:24,232
What's happening?

87
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:25,661
Go away!

88
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:29,367
Hey! Hey!

89
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:30,669
Don't touch me.

90
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,719
Don't touch me.

91
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,142
We don't want any trouble.

92
00:04:38,037 --> 00:04:40,107
What happened exactly?

93
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,717
Some young Palestinian boys and girls
were standing there,

94
00:04:44,037 --> 00:04:46,974
then that guy attacked them with a stick.
Look at it in his hand.

95
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:48,327
They are thieves.

96
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,476
They are thieves.

97
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,639
They are not just here.
They live in my house!

98
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,460
-They are in your house?
-Yes, they are.

99
00:04:53,873 --> 00:04:55,109
Come, let me show you.

100
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,164
This house was given to my grandmother

101
00:04:58,188 --> 00:05:01,077
because she was a refugee
from Haifa in 1948.

102
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,664
-This house.
-This one?

103
00:05:02,766 --> 00:05:04,754
It was built by my father in 2000

104
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:08,003
because he got married and had children,
so he needed more space.

105
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,744
After my father finished building the house,
we were never allowed to live there.

106
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,485
The judge came and sealed it permanently.

107
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:18,637
He kept it sealed on the pretense
that it was built without a permit.

108
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:22,896
-Who lives in it now?
-Settlers. Young men, not families.

109
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,459
You live in that house?

110
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,574
-They live here.
-And they live in this one?

111
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:27,601
Exactly.

112
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:31,645
Both my father and my mother
worked and saved to build this house.

113
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,037
It was built with blood, sweat, and tears.

114
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,540
And then the Israeli court

115
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:39,181
issued a decree
allowing settlers to live in it.

116
00:05:39,301 --> 00:05:41,528
It's true that this house
was built without a permit

117
00:05:41,612 --> 00:05:43,014
and received two demolition orders.

118
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:47,112
So, why would they allow
Israeli settlers to live in it

119
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:49,262
and not me, the Palestinian?

120
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:52,032
What sort of a democracy is this?

121
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:55,574
How do you feel when you see him?

122
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:56,369
Oppressed.

123
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,187
Disturbed.

124
00:06:01,073 --> 00:06:02,638
It's annoying and exhausting.

125
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,657
I don't cry because I'm weak.

126
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:09,800
Never.

127
00:06:09,927 --> 00:06:10,983
Believe me.

128
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,206
I swear.

129
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,778
But I cry because we are not dealing
with a just state.

130
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,043
This is an occupation.

131
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,168
This is our land.

132
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:23,182
I was born, raised, and have lived here.

133
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,397
How can someone come and take it?
How does that make any sense?

134
00:06:26,665 --> 00:06:29,177
What's happening is a violation
of international law.

135
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,184
This is a war crime.
Forced eviction is a war crime.

136
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:39,843
Hello.

137
00:06:39,887 --> 00:06:41,514
-Hello. Hi.
-Hi, how are you?

138
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,289
-Thank God. Still alive.
-Yeah.

139
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46,649
You're a difficult man to get hold of.

140
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,929
Yeah, I generally don't interview,

141
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:52,287
but given the circumstances
and the bad press that's out there…

142
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:55,746
decided that we need to
do some damage control.

143
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:58,198
Jacob Fauci is an American Israeli.

144
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:02,860
He became infamous after Muna
confronted him and the video went viral.

145
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:05,412
Jacob, you know this is not your house!

146
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:07,161
Yes, but if I go, you don't go back.

147
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:08,816
So, what's the problem?
Why are you yelling at me?

148
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:09,668
I didn't do this.

149
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:12,261
You are stealing my house.

150
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:14,134
And if I don't steal it,
someone else is going to steal it.

151
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:18,822
No! No one--
No one is allowed to steal it, Jacob!

152
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:22,687
He's been living in an additional
part of Muna's house for over ten years

153
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,212
after being recruited
by a US-based company

154
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:27,113
called Nahalat Shimon International

155
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,768
which owns the property under Israeli law.

156
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:31,394
How did you end up here?

157
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,189
It's a long story.

158
00:07:32,213 --> 00:07:34,251
Basically, I needed to
move from where I was.

159
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:37,601
And my friend was very very
active in this neighborhood.

160
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:39,740
And he said you can stay
here for the time being.

161
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:40,979
Do you pay rent?

162
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,387
I have an arrangement
with the owners of the house.

163
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:45,852
I don't wanna get into personal
arrangements and rents and things.

164
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,930
But yes, I'm a tenant here. I'm not--
I have no ownership over this property.

165
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:50,790
-You're from Brooklyn?
-No, I'm from New York.

166
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:52,081
-From Long Island.
-From New York.

167
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:54,194
What right do you have to live here?

168
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:57,640
The right I have is that the owner
of the house wants me to live here.

169
00:07:57,773 --> 00:08:00,211
And he wants there to be Jews
living in his house. And he wants--

170
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,850
And I got chosen--
For whatever reason, it ended up being me.

171
00:08:03,057 --> 00:08:04,172
-We as a--
-So, why do you live here?

172
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,622
Because I live here.
Because it's important.

173
00:08:05,647 --> 00:08:07,234
And because not too many
people want to live here.

174
00:08:07,284 --> 00:08:10,171
And it's important to strengthen
this neighborhood to make sure that

175
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:13,263
this neighborhood is not
lost in any future peace deal.

176
00:08:14,239 --> 00:08:18,828
No, no to occupation.
Occupation will disappear!

177
00:08:18,912 --> 00:08:23,263
No, no to occupation.
Occupation will disappear!

178
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:24,851
This is not their ancestral land.

179
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,228
They've not been here for generations.

180
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,416
They came here in 1956 because
they had nowhere else to be.

181
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,077
And somebody illegally put them here.

182
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:32,631
Whatever they're accusing me of is…

183
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:35,901
is no different from what they're doing
and what they did.

184
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:39,926
So, your position here is a political
position to keep Palestinians out of it?

185
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,973
Not to keep Palestinians out of it,
to keep Jews in it.

186
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:44,358
And therefore keep the
Palestinians who were here out of it.

187
00:08:44,434 --> 00:08:46,250
No-- That's not--
No.

188
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,258
That's a--
That's a necessary evil.

189
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:50,430
Whatever the situation is,

190
00:08:50,455 --> 00:08:52,696
and that's what I was trying
to explain in that viral video,

191
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,013
they're not coming back here.

192
00:08:54,138 --> 00:08:55,969
This part of the house, for sure, is lost.

193
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:58,320
The second part of the house,
unless there is some major miracle,

194
00:08:58,345 --> 00:08:59,479
is going to be lost.

195
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,234
And they're not coming back in here.

196
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:03,083
So, whether I'm here,
whether I'm not here,

197
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,391
whether it's me,
whether it's someone else,

198
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:06,107
whether it's a monkey,
whether it's a giraffe,

199
00:09:06,191 --> 00:09:08,015
they're not coming
back into this house ever.

200
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:10,861
I understand why they're angry at me.
I understand why they dislike me.

201
00:09:10,945 --> 00:09:12,962
But I did not do this to them.
I'm not doing this to them.

202
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:16,051
And, as I said, if I leave,
I'll be replaced immediately.

203
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:19,793
And I venture to think that whoever
comes here is not going to be as…

204
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:21,962
easy-going as I am.

205
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:28,267
I've been instructed
to disperse the crowd.

206
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,795
Jacob's Nahalat Shimon International's
unyielding stance

207
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:36,726
is being challenged both inside
the neighborhood and in court.

208
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:39,259
Where lawyers representing
the families argue

209
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:41,504
it's illegal under international law

210
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:43,718
to displace anyone from occupied land.

211
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,189
They're also arguing that
there's a double standard.

212
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,219
Israel allows Jews
to return to their homeland,

213
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,032
but not Palestinians.

214
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:53,719
-Go over there!
-It's okay.

215
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,494
-I don't want to cause a problem.
-You're in my way.

216
00:09:55,518 --> 00:09:56,771
-I just want to ask you, "Why?"
-Talk to me in Hebrew.

217
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:57,964
-Over there. Go.
-I just--

218
00:09:57,988 --> 00:10:00,088
I wanna ask you why
you have taken the man.

219
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:05,102
Nahalat Shimon International did not
respond to our request for comment.

220
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:12,502
Across the street from Muna's home
is a house that belonged to a family

221
00:10:12,586 --> 00:10:14,785
pushed out in the last round of evictions.

222
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,100
We found Abu Ayman Al Ghawi alone

223
00:10:18,496 --> 00:10:20,515
sitting outside his old house.

224
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:24,554
So, you used to live in
this house across the road.

225
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:26,110
What happened?

226
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:30,697
They kicked us out
on the street in an hour.

227
00:10:31,153 --> 00:10:36,843
They destroyed the doors and beat us,
our children, and women.

228
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:40,794
They forcefully threw us out.

229
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:44,884
Were you given any help,
any money, a place to stay?

230
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:46,761
What sort of support did you get?

231
00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:50,805
They didn't give us any assistance.
They didn't give us a flat or rent.

232
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:53,578
Imagine, we have lived
here under this tree

233
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:55,856
outside our flat for seven months.

234
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:58,202
So, what happened to all your
belongings that were in the house?

235
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:00,848
They took all the
furniture and dumped it.

236
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,729
We don't know where
they took the furniture.

237
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:07,302
We left with only the
clothes we were wearing.

238
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:09,858
I was in my pajamas,

239
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:13,445
and my wife left without slippers.

240
00:11:13,877 --> 00:11:16,224
How long exactly have
you lived in this house?

241
00:11:16,767 --> 00:11:19,495
I was born here in 1962.

242
00:11:19,585 --> 00:11:20,619
STOP OUR HOMES

243
00:11:20,644 --> 00:11:24,362
Jerusalem is our right,
not the settlers'.

244
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:30,125
The settlers came from
America, Russia, and Germany.

245
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:33,563
They don't have more of
a right to live here than me.

246
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:37,824
I was born here, and my blood
and tears are in this house.

247
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:41,723
SHEIKH JARRAH

248
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,355
Arieh King, a right-wing activist,

249
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:47,689
who was appointed East Jerusalem's
Deputy Mayors last year,

250
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,142
says the right belongs
to the Jewish people.

251
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,562
When we are Jews

252
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,610
in the States, in Australia,
in England, in Jerusalem,

253
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,645
we're facing towards one place.

254
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:02,781
Haram al-Sharif.

255
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,231
Mount-- Temple Mount.

256
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,429
-I mean, that's religion.
-Of course.

257
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,755
Talking about a religion

258
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:12,089
when you're talking about people
and the land and where they live,

259
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:13,565
is it relevant?

260
00:12:13,644 --> 00:12:14,554
Absolutely!

261
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:18,237
So, you can't really justify ownership

262
00:12:18,544 --> 00:12:22,455
over religion when there are
so many different types of Arabs.

263
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:26,568
Of course not.
But I'm just explaining what we are--

264
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:29,259
The way that we see Jerusalem,

265
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,071
it's a different way than any other…

266
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,401
religion.

267
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,004
As a Jew, you can live

268
00:12:35,373 --> 00:12:36,784
everywhere in the world,

269
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:39,339
you can be the most orthodox Jew,

270
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:42,043
if you don't live in Jerusalem,

271
00:12:42,501 --> 00:12:43,583
you cannot…

272
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:47,905
keep the entire commitment of God.

273
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:53,776
Do you want to see a Sheikh Jarrah…

274
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,408
that is…

275
00:12:56,864 --> 00:12:57,776
Jewish?

276
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:58,681
Of course.

277
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:00,403
Without Arabs?

278
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,722
I want to see Jews, yes.

279
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:12,292
As the neighborhood
waits on the eviction appeal,

280
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:13,897
support for the families is growing.

281
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:15,383
This is our land!

282
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:17,838
Police are getting more aggressive.

283
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,347
As it's getting closer, the smell
is getting really really strong.

284
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,535
We can see everybody just ran inside.

285
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:40,739
Because they don't want
to be sprayed with that.

286
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,874
It smells like sewage.

287
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,653
Close it. Close it.

288
00:13:46,831 --> 00:13:49,868
One night, police even raided
a Palestinian resident's house…

289
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:51,638
for playing loud music.

290
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,978
Tell him to turn off the music!

291
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:59,967
It's my house.

292
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,638
-What are you doing?
-Come here. Come on!

293
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:05,550
-Let me take him.
-Take him.

294
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:09,761
Why? Tell him to turn the music off.

295
00:14:09,845 --> 00:14:13,422
-I want to go inside.
-Come on, move!

296
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:14,749
Move away!

297
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,709
Close the door completely.

298
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,732
Don't open the door.

299
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:39,314
Stay away from her!

300
00:14:46,801 --> 00:14:47,914
It's our house.

301
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,657
There is music here.

302
00:14:53,513 --> 00:14:55,160
Move!

303
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,300
Move!

304
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,429
Son of a bitch, go outside!

305
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:20,053
Get out!

306
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:25,070
On another night,
police detained Muna's younger brother

307
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,593
and held him for hours when
he was trying to go home.

308
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:29,048
He lives here!

309
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,718
Why are you pushing me?

310
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:40,067
Calm down.

311
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,632
Now do you know where he is?

312
00:15:52,986 --> 00:15:54,066
We don't know,

313
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:57,131
but we're going to check
to see if he's at the police headquarters.

314
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,617
You're the one who arrested my brother!

315
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,407
May God not bless you! May God break
your arms, you animal! Son of a bitch!

316
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,263
As Ramadan neared its end,

317
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,754
Palestinians flocked to Al Aqsa Mosque.

318
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,522
And the Israeli police
once again stormed in.

319
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:27,099
ISRAEL POLICE VIA STORYFUL

320
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:33,685
Hundreds of people were injured.

321
00:16:33,803 --> 00:16:35,911
But many medics were
prevented from entering.

322
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:38,621
We've been outside for a while.
They wouldn't let us in.

323
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,255
We've now made it into the grounds.

324
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:45,150
There are the remnants of
stun grenades everywhere.

325
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,617
East Jerusalem is at the heart

326
00:16:48,706 --> 00:16:50,982
of the Palestine-Israel conflict.

327
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:52,367
And right now…

328
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:54,378
it's exploded.

329
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:55,981
Come inside! Come inside!

330
00:16:58,455 --> 00:17:02,128
The Palestinians are taking
refuge inside the Aqsa Mosque.

331
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:05,165
God is great!

332
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:15,057
While Palestinians barricaded
themselves in the mosque,

333
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,465
close by, right-wing Israelis,
including Arieh King,

334
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:22,875
celebrated the date Israel
captured Jerusalem in 1967.

335
00:17:26,372 --> 00:17:27,960
A lot is happening right now.

336
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:32,125
Al Aqsa, what you call Jerusalem Day,
Sheikh Jarrah.

337
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:34,805
Do you think that
this is a very delicate moment?

338
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,691
It's a delicate moment like many
other moments that we have here.

339
00:17:38,325 --> 00:17:40,474
And we've passed many moments like that…

340
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:42,563
and we'll pass this also.

341
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:44,781
What do you want to see in the end?

342
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,547
What would make you happy?

343
00:17:47,222 --> 00:17:48,793
To see the temple built…

344
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:53,573
at the temple mark where
there is the Dome of the Rock.

345
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:55,235
In the holy of holiness…

346
00:17:55,943 --> 00:17:56,958
we believe,

347
00:17:57,123 --> 00:17:58,545
and we trust God,

348
00:17:58,796 --> 00:17:59,915
and we believe God,

349
00:17:59,939 --> 00:18:01,836
So, we trust that it will happen.

350
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:05,272
And we need to do everything
to ensure it happens in our days.

351
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,192
2021-05-13
THURSDAY 14:27:16

352
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:15,128
In retaliation, for the
storming of the Al Aqsa,

353
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:18,138
Hamas, the Palestinian
militant group that governs Gaza,

354
00:18:18,237 --> 00:18:19,610
fired on Israel.

355
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:23,717
At least 13 civilians had been killed,
including two children.

356
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:24,862
GAZA CITY

357
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:28,373
Israel responded with a
disproportionate show of force

358
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:30,385
leveling apartment
buildings and newsrooms.

359
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,401
In one of the most densely
populated places on earth,

360
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,406
to escape is impossible.

361
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,727
Israel has closed off the
crossing into the blockaded strip.

362
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:46,917
So far, over 200 Palestinians have
been killed, including 61 children.

363
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,172
When the bombing stops

364
00:18:51,446 --> 00:18:54,325
and the international
community is no longer watching,

365
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,436
Muna will still be fighting,

366
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:59,179
including Israel's Supreme Court.

367
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,182
The residents of Sheikh Jarrah say

368
00:19:03,264 --> 00:19:05,909
court cases like this
happen on a monthly basis.

369
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:08,375
But they still say despite the
amount of times they've been here,

370
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,726
they have no faith in the justice system.

371
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,085
They say it's their land,

372
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,777
and we say that it's not their land.

373
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:24,826
In the coming weeks,

374
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:29,168
the courts will make a decision on the
cases of 28 families appealing eviction.

375
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:32,271
If they lose, they'll be left homeless.

376
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:36,530
When you sat inside there,
as a Palestinian in an Israeli court,

377
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:38,059
do you feel the same as them?

378
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:39,337
Do you feel equal to them?

379
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,304
I feel that even my most basic right,

380
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,835
having an Arabic translator,
was not given to me.

381
00:19:45,986 --> 00:19:49,302
In the end, we're dealing with
a system of settlers.

382
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:54,567
They don't want us
Palestinians to stay in our land.

383
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,485
They want to make Jerusalem
the unified capital of Israel

384
00:19:56,762 --> 00:20:02,418
and they want to do an ethnic cleansing
of all the Palestinians in Jerusalem.

385
00:20:03,184 --> 00:20:06,503
We will not give our homes to them.

386
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:07,586
No way!

387
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,643
I always say that I would
chain myself to the house.

388
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,528
I won't leave.
They'd better come and drag me out of it.
