00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:12,795
Hi, guys.
This is F@nny.

2
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:14,989
Welcome to this English pronunciation video.

3
00:00:14,989 --> 00:00:20,473
In this video we will focus on two English
vowel sounds:

4
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:22,907
/I/ and /i:/

5
00:00:22,907 --> 00:00:26,646
Now I know they sound very similar, but they
are different.

6
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:30,694
And they are two very important vowel sounds
in English.

7
00:00:30,694 --> 00:00:36,088
So let's start with our two example words:

8
00:00:36,088 --> 00:00:37,591
sit

9
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:41,139
Now listen to how I pronounce this word.

10
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:42,735
sit

11
00:00:42,735 --> 00:00:45,490
Can you hear the /i/ sound?

12
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,794
sit

13
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:50,458
Now listen to another word:

14
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,986
seat

15
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,582
Can you hear the pronunciation?

16
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:55,840
seat

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,844
/i:/ sound.

18
00:00:56,844 --> 00:00:58,966
seat

19
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:00,637
sit

20
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:02,165
seat

21
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:06,161
I know it can be difficult at first.

22
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:10,126
But with a little bit of practice, I'm sure
you will hear them differently.

23
00:01:10,126 --> 00:01:14,950
Although they are similar, they are two different
vowel sounds.

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,583
I promise you by the end of this video
you will hear and pronounce them differently.

25
00:01:20,583 --> 00:01:22,124
So keep watching.

26
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:26,765
Get ready students.

27
00:01:26,765 --> 00:01:31,728
I'm gonna help you make these vowel sounds
/I/ and /i:/.

28
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:35,254
I really want you to be able to hear the difference

29
00:01:35,254 --> 00:01:37,608
and to pronounce them correctly.

30
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:43,329
It is very important for you to know the IPA
spelling.

31
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,318
Watch how I move my mouth.

32
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:50,509
And always repeat after me in this video.

33
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,113
I know that you can master these vowel sounds.

34
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,929
Let's get started.

35
00:01:56,929 --> 00:02:02,709
First, let's try to make the sound /I/.

36
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:05,966
So when you pronounce it,

37
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:08,911
your tongue is a little higher in your mouth,

38
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,604
closer to the front.

39
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:14,604
/I/
Stretch out your lips a little.

40
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:18,116
And it's a short sound.

41
00:02:18,116 --> 00:02:21,772
/I/
Repeat after me.

42
00:02:21,772 --> 00:02:28,933
/I/

43
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:32,043
Let’s now practice with the word, sit.

44
00:02:32,043 --> 00:02:34,858
Repeat after me.

45
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:43,653
sit

46
00:02:43,653 --> 00:02:45,052
Good guys.

47
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:48,762
Let's now practice the second sound, /i:/.

48
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:52,080
So the tongue has the same position.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,504
It's a little bit higher, closer to the front.

50
00:02:54,504 --> 00:03:00,197
But, when you say /i:/, you stretch out your lips a little more.

51
00:03:00,197 --> 00:03:02,018
And it's a long sound.

52
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,737
/i:/

53
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:06,723
Your lips should feel a little tighter, too.

54
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,334
/i:/

55
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:10,260
Repeat after me.

56
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:17,353
/i:/

57
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:20,238
Let's practice with the word, seat.

58
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:22,466
Repeat after me.

59
00:03:22,466 --> 00:03:30,493
seat

60
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:31,861
Good guys.

61
00:03:31,861 --> 00:03:33,939
So we're going to use minimal pairs.

62
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,326
They’re words with very similar sounds,

63
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:39,799
but the actual vowel sounds are different.

64
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,173
And they're a very good way to practice these
vowel sounds.

65
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,813
So let's now practice together.

66
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:48,728
First, just the sounds.

67
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,229
Watch my mouth.

68
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,027
And repeat after me.

69
00:03:52,027 --> 00:04:00,488
/I/

70
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:08,201
/i:/

71
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:10,297
/I/

72
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:12,528
/i:/

73
00:04:12,528 --> 00:04:14,064
/I/

74
00:04:14,064 --> 00:04:16,302
/i:/

75
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:18,498
/I/

76
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:20,620
/i:/

77
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,020
Can you see my mouth?

78
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:24,347
Okay let's now practice with the words.

79
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:33,765
sit

80
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:42,366
seat

81
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,443
sit

82
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:47,433
seat

83
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,795
sit

84
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:51,848
seat

85
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:53,970
sit

86
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,557
seat

87
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,782
Good job guys.

88
00:04:59,782 --> 00:05:03,616
Okay guys let's now move on to minimal pairs.

89
00:05:03,616 --> 00:05:05,263
I have a few for you.

90
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,349
I'm gonna read them to you.

91
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:08,442
I want you to be very careful.

92
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,502
Look at my mouth - how it moves.

93
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:12,329
And repeat after me.

94
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:16,134
Let's get started.

95
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:04,239
Let's practice further.

96
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,634
I'm now going to show you some words

97
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:11,990
and I want you to read them with the proper English vowel sound.

98
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,251
/I/ or /i:/

99
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:17,769
Let's get started.

100
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:21,261
Let's start with the first word.

101
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,362
Which one is it?

102
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:27,132
Is it sit or is it seat?

103
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:29,898
Of course it is sit.

104
00:09:29,898 --> 00:09:32,740
Next word.

105
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,912
Is it chick or is it cheek?

106
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:40,731
It's chick.

107
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:43,149
Next word.

108
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:47,606
fill or feel?

109
00:09:47,606 --> 00:09:50,469
fill

110
00:09:50,469 --> 00:09:52,437
Next word.

111
00:09:52,437 --> 00:09:56,097
his or he's?

112
00:09:56,097 --> 00:10:00,698
Of course his.

113
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:04,311
chin or cheat?

114
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:08,251
Its cheat.

115
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:13,480
Is it pip or is it peep?

116
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,498
Of course people it’s pip.

117
00:10:16,498 --> 00:10:18,922
Next word.

118
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:23,263
bitch or beach?

119
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:26,124
It's beach.

120
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:29,948
Then we have sit or seat.

121
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:31,720
Which one is it?

122
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,469
It's seat.

123
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:39,055
his oh he's?

124
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,381
It's he's.

125
00:10:41,381 --> 00:10:47,067
And finally, is it hill or heel?

126
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:48,736
It's heel.

127
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:50,042
Great guys.

128
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:51,400
Let's continue on.

129
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,591
Okay guys, let's now move on to sentences.

130
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,111
I have a few sentences for you with different
/I/ and /i:/ sounds.

131
00:11:00,111 --> 00:11:03,870
So pay attention and repeat after me.

132
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,873
The first sentence is:

133
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:16,859
Pick a seat and sit without making a peep.

134
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:19,966
The second sentence:

135
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:28,618
Don't peel a peach or eat its pit.

136
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:30,156
And finally.

137
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:39,651
I feel sick and ill after eating the big meal.

138
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:42,717
Excellent guys.
Let's move on.

139
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:44,087
Great job guys.

140
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:49,688
I know you now have a better understanding
of the difference between the English vowel sounds

141
00:11:49,688 --> 00:11:52,017
/I/ and /i:/.

142
00:11:52,017 --> 00:11:53,076
It's difficult.

143
00:11:53,076 --> 00:11:56,632
It takes time and practice to master,

144
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,799
but you can do it.

145
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,780
So keep practicing and make sure to watch
my other pronunciation videos

146
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,307
very important if you want to improve your
English skills.

147

Bye

155
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:40,566
Hello guys and welcome to this English pronunciation video.

156
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:46,720
In this video, I'm going to focus on two very
important vowel sounds in English.

157
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,272
/e/ and /ɪ/

158
00:12:50,272 --> 00:12:51,820
Let's take two example words.

159
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,095
The first word is 'bed'.

160
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:57,497
Can you hear /e/ the sound?

161
00:12:57,497 --> 00:12:59,122
'bed'

162
00:12:59,122 --> 00:13:02,308
Now the second word is, bid.

163
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:04,837
Can you hear the /ɪ/ sound?

164
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:06,674
bid

165
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:08,194
bed

166
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:09,342
bid

167
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:13,133
I know they sound similar, but they are different.

168
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:17,540
And with a little bit of practice, you will
start hearing them differently.

169
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,076
I promise you that.

170
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:20,225
So keep watching.

171
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:25,018
Get ready guys.

172
00:13:25,018 --> 00:13:30,249
I am going to help you make these sounds
/e/ and /ɪ/.

173
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:35,340
I want you to be able to hear the difference
and to pronounce them correctly.

174
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,176
It's very important, also for you to know the IPA spelling.

175
00:13:40,176 --> 00:13:42,920
Watch how I move my mouth.

176
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,997
And as usual, repeat after me.

177
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:50,434
I know that you can master these vowel sounds,
So let's get to it.

178
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:55,015
So let's first practice how to make the sound
/e/.

179
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:58,562
So your tongue is in a middle part of your mouth.

180
00:13:58,562 --> 00:14:00,230
/e/

181
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:03,091
Watch my mouth.
How it moves.

182
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:04,733
/e/

183
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:09,536
Can you watch my mouth and repeat after me now?

184
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:17,822
/e/

185
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:20,841
Okay let's now practice with a word, ‘bed’.

186
00:14:20,841 --> 00:14:23,407
Can you repeat after me?

187
00:14:23,407 --> 00:14:31,634
bed

188
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:32,446
Good job.

189
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:35,187
Moving on to the sound /ɪ/.

190
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:40,219
Now your tongue - it's a little higher than
for the /e/ sound.

191
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:42,804
And you should stretch out your lips a little.

192
00:14:42,804 --> 00:14:46,491
And it's a short sound.

193
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:47,993
/ɪ/

194
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:51,716
So let's practice.
Repeat after me.

195
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:59,554
/ɪ/

196
00:14:59,554 --> 00:15:03,992
Let's practice with a word, ‘bid’.

197
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:08,325
Watch how my mouth moves and repeat after me.

198
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:16,634
bid

199
00:15:16,676 --> 00:15:20,029
Okay guys, let's now use minimal pairs -

200
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:23,809
same words only the vowel sounds change.

201
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,114
They're a good way to practice these sounds.

202
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,950
But first just the sounds,

203
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,821
so just watch how my mouth moves

204
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:35,127
and repeat after me.

205
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:43,019
/e/

206
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:51,283
/ɪ/

207
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,479
/e/

208
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:55,677
/ɪ/

209
00:15:55,677 --> 00:15:57,770
/e/

210
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,936
/ɪ/

211
00:15:59,936 --> 00:16:02,104
/e/

212
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:04,564
/ɪ/

213
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:08,920
Let's now take the words ‘bed’ and ‘bid’.

214
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,623
Repeat after me.

215
00:16:11,623 --> 00:16:21,750
bed

216
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,790
bid

217
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,902
bed

218
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:31,217
bid

219
00:16:31,217 --> 00:16:33,315
bed

220
00:16:33,315 --> 00:16:35,543
bid

221
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:37,580
bed

222
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,679
bid
Good, guys.

223
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,729
Okay guys, let's now read minimal pairs together.

224
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:47,792
Repeat after me.

225
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,729
And watch how my mouth moves.

226
00:16:50,729 --> 00:16:52,700
Let's go.

227
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,607
Okay let's continue practicing.

228
00:18:57,607 --> 00:18:59,802
I'm now going to show you some words

229
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:03,823
and I want you to read them with the proper English vowel sound

230
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:06,122
/e/ and /ɪ/.

231
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:09,178
Let's get started.

232
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:12,067
Let's start with the first word.

233
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,340
Which one is it?

234
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,689
‘beg’ or ‘big’?

235
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:22,240
It's beg.

236
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,009
Next word.

237
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:30,000
Which one is it?
‘bet’ or ‘bit’?

238
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
It's ‘bit’.

239
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,503
Next word.

240
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:41,808
Which one is it?
‘mess’ or ‘miss’?

241
00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:45,359
It’s ‘mess’.

242
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,543
The following word.

243
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:53,177
Which one is it?
‘set’ or ‘sit’?

244
00:19:53,177 --> 00:19:56,334
It's ‘set’ of course.

245
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:59,392
Next word.

246
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:04,226
Which one is it?
‘left’ or ‘lift’?

247
00:20:04,226 --> 00:20:08,051
lift

248
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:11,091
Next word.

249
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:15,925
‘hell’ or ‘hill’?

250
00:20:15,925 --> 00:20:18,786
‘hill’ obviously.

251
00:20:18,786 --> 00:20:21,810
Next word.

252
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,545
‘beg’ or ‘big’?

253
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:30,396
It's ‘big’ this time.

254
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:33,421
Next word.

255
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:38,650
‘dead’ or ‘did’?

256
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,223
It's ‘dead’ of course.

257
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:48,390
Then we have ‘mess’ or ‘miss’?

258
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,336
It is ‘miss’.

259
00:20:52,337 --> 00:21:00,000
And finally, ‘dead’ or ‘did’?

260
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,367
‘did’

261
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,694
Great guys!
Let's continue on.

262
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:08,589
Okay guys.
Moving on to sentences now.

263
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:10,675
I have sentences for you

264
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:14,296
and they're filled with /e/ and /ɪ/ sounds.

265
00:21:14,296 --> 00:21:17,599
So pay attention and repeat after me.

266
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,095
The first sentence is,

267
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:27,958
‘Ken did not sit on the hill.’

268
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,341
The second sentence,

269
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:37,757
‘My pet pig fell off the cliff.’

270
00:21:37,757 --> 00:21:38,905
And finally,

271
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:46,055
‘Set the big desk in the middle.’

272
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,889
Good job, guys.
Let's carry on.

273
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:49,867
Great guys.

274
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:55,239
Well now you have a better understanding of
the difference between the English vowel sounds

275
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:57,065
/e/ and /ɪ/.

276
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,838
Keep practicing.

277
00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:00,055
Practice makes perfect.

278
00:22:00,055 --> 00:22:01,860
I know you can do it.

279
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,964
And make sure to watch the rest of my pronunciation
videos.

Thank you.

289
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:40,296
Hello, students.
This is F@nny.

290
00:22:40,296 --> 00:22:42,852
Welcome to this English pronunciation video.

291
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:48,041
In this video we are going to focus on two
English vowel sounds.

292
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:51,095
/e/ and /eɪ/

293
00:22:51,095 --> 00:22:54,891
These are two very important vowel sounds in English.

294
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:58,990
And they sound different even though very similar.

295
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,814
Let's start with two example words.

296
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,343
The first word is ‘let’.

297
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,961
Can you hear the sound /e/?

298
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,945
‘let’

299
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:14,507
The second word is ‘late’.

300
00:23:14,507 --> 00:23:17,308
/eɪ/
‘late’

301
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:21,579
So ‘let’ and ‘late’

302
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:25,235
I know to some of you they sound exactly the same.

303
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:29,352
But with a little bit of practice you will hear the difference,

304
00:23:29,352 --> 00:23:31,845
and if you keep practising with me,

305
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,423
by the end of this video,

306
00:23:33,423 --> 00:23:37,716
I promise you will hear and pronounce them correctly.

307
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:40,664
So keep watching.

308
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:43,797
Get ready guys.

309
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:48,932
I'm gonna help you make these sounds /e/
and /eɪ/ in English.

310
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:53,919
I want you to hear the difference and to be
able to pronounce them correctly.

311
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,769
Also, it's very important to know the IPA spelling,

312
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:01,283
watch how I move my mouth,

313
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:04,256
and as usual repeat after me.

314
00:24:04,256 --> 00:24:08,935
I know that you can master these sounds,
so let's get to it.

315
00:24:08,936 --> 00:24:14,525
First, let's learn how to make the sound /e/.

316
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:17,470
So your tongue is in the middle part of your mouth.

317
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,523
Okay, and your mouth and doesn't move.
/e/

318
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:25,102
Can you repeat after me?

319
00:24:25,102 --> 00:24:31,973
/e/

320
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:34,550
Let's now practice with a word please.

321
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,487
Repeat after me.

322
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:45,693
let

323
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,722
For the sound /eɪ/.

324
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,582
It's a little bit trickier.

325
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:52,064
It's what we call a diphthong.

326
00:24:52,064 --> 00:24:55,762
So it's actually two vowel sounds combined.

327
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:57,866
/eɪ/

328
00:24:57,866 --> 00:25:00,974
So as you can see, your mouth moves,

329
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:04,807
and your tongue goes up a little

330
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:09,106
as you produce the sound /eɪ/.

331
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:10,310
Can you repeat after me?

332
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:19,439
/eɪ/

333
00:25:19,439 --> 00:25:21,551
Let's practise with the word ‘late’.

334
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:24,132
Repeat after me.

335
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:35,213
late

336
00:25:35,213 --> 00:25:36,444
Great job!

337
00:25:36,444 --> 00:25:38,720
Let's now use minimal pairs.

338
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,842
So words that are extremely similar but the vowel
sounds change.

339
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:47,894
They're a very good way to practice your vowel sounds.

340
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:51,363
First let's just practice the sounds.

341
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:57,987
So watch how my mouth moves and repeat after me.

342
00:25:57,987 --> 00:26:06,471
/e/

343
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:15,695
/eɪ/

344
00:26:15,695 --> 00:26:17,905
/e/

345
00:26:17,905 --> 00:26:20,538
/eɪ/

346
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,990
/e/

347
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,935
/eɪ/

348
00:26:25,935 --> 00:26:27,983
/e/

349
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:31,137
/eɪ/

350
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:38,084
Let's now use our words ‘let’ and ‘late’.
Repeat after me.

351
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:47,484
let

352
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:56,462
late

353
00:26:56,462 --> 00:26:59,103
let

354
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:02,123
late

355
00:27:02,123 --> 00:27:04,543
let

356
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:07,502
late

357
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:10,075
let

358
00:27:10,075 --> 00:27:12,832
late

359
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:14,574
Excellent job, guys.

360
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:18,055
Let's now find out about other minimal pairs.

361
00:27:18,055 --> 00:27:19,502
I'm gonna read them to you.

362
00:27:19,502 --> 00:27:21,356
I want you to repeat after me

363
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:25,073
and pay attention to my mouth and how it moves.

364
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:27,356
Let's go.

365
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:03,358
Excellent guys.
Let's move on.

366
00:31:03,358 --> 00:31:05,790
Ok let's continue practicing.

367
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,046
Now I'm going to show you some words

368
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:12,653
and I want you to read them with the proper English vowel sound

369
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:15,362
/e/ or /eɪ/

370
00:31:15,362 --> 00:31:17,009
Let's get started.

371
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:21,671
Let's start with the first word.

372
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:26,554
Is it ‘bed’ or ‘bade’?

373
00:31:26,554 --> 00:31:30,402
It's ‘bed’ of course.

374
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:33,263
Next word.

375
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:36,148
‘fell’ or ‘fail’?

376
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,446
Which one is it?

377
00:31:38,446 --> 00:31:41,011
It's ‘fail’.

378
00:31:41,011 --> 00:31:44,562
Next word.

380
00:31:49,863 --> 00:31:56,374
It’s ‘taste’.

381
00:31:56,375 --> 00:32:01,575
‘men’?
‘main’?

382
00:32:01,575 --> 00:32:03,839
‘main’

383
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,026
Next word.

384
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:12,653
‘ren’?
‘rain’?

385
00:32:12,653 --> 00:32:16,757
It's ‘rain’.

386
00:32:16,757 --> 00:32:23,905
Next ‘sell’ or ‘sale’?

387
00:32:23,905 --> 00:32:26,843
It's ‘sell’.

388
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:30,419
Next word.

389
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:34,864
‘test’? ‘taste’?
Which one is it?

390
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:37,828
In this case, it's ‘test’.

391
00:32:37,828 --> 00:32:42,110
Next word.

392
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:46,549
‘men’?
‘main’?

393
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,106
It's ‘men’.

394
00:32:50,106 --> 00:32:56,559
Next word.
‘sell’ or ‘sale’?

395
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,553
‘sale’ of course.

396
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:02,914
And finally,

397
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:07,373
‘when’ or ‘wane’?

398
00:33:07,373 --> 00:33:09,756
It's ‘when’.

399
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:11,759
Very good.

400
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,274
Great job guys.
Let's carry on.

401
00:33:14,274 --> 00:33:17,680
Okay guys let's now practice with sentences.

402
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,981
I have sentences containing /e/ and /eɪ/sounds.

403
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:25,453
So pay attention and repeat after me.

404
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:28,318
The first sentence is:

405
00:33:28,318 --> 00:33:34,747
‘Ken made cakes well.’

406
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:37,016
The second sentence:

407
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:44,021
‘Tell him to send red paint.’

408
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:52,911
And finally:
‘Men fed a whale in the rain.’

409
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:55,471
Great guys.
Let's continue on.

410
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:56,560
Great job guys.

411
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,377
You now have a better understanding of the
difference between the English vowel sounds

412
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:03,406
/e/ and /eɪ/.

413
00:34:03,406 --> 00:34:04,714
But keep practicing.

414
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:11,011
It takes time and practice of listening and
speaking to master the vowel sounds.

415
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:12,944
But you can do it.

416
00:34:12,944 --> 00:34:17,251
Also make sure you watch the rest of my pronunciation
videos.

417
00:34:17,251 --> 00:34:21,074
Very important if you want to master the English
language.

418
00:34:21,074 --> 00:34:22,994
See you next time.

419
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:29,025
Thank you so much guys for watching my video.

420
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,252

424
00:34:36,822 --> 00:34:40,162
See you.

425
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:50,730
Hello, students.
This is F@nny.

426
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,643
Welcome to this English pronunciation video.

427
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:58,876
In this video, I'm going to focus on two English
vowel sounds:

428
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:01,185
/æ/ and /ʌ/

429
00:35:01,185 --> 00:35:04,343
They sound similar, but they are different

430
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:07,556
so you need to pronounce them differently.

431
00:35:07,556 --> 00:35:10,883
Let's start with two example words.

432
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:14,908
My first example word is ‘ran’.

433
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:17,160
Can you hear the /æ/ sound?

434
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,969
‘ran’

435
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:23,572
My second word is, ‘run’.

436
00:35:23,572 --> 00:35:26,541
/ʌ/
run

437
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,521
ran
run

438
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:30,866
Can you hear the difference?

439
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:33,890
I  know they sound very similar.

440
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,473
But if you practise with me,

441
00:35:35,473 --> 00:35:38,025
I promise by the end of this video,

442
00:35:38,025 --> 00:35:41,334
you will hear and pronounce them correctly.

443
00:35:41,334 --> 00:35:44,413
So keep watching.

444
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:47,949
Get ready guys.

445
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:51,001
I am going to help you make these sounds.

446
00:35:51,001 --> 00:35:53,887
/æ/ and /ʌ/ in English.

447
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:56,747
I want you to hear the difference very clearly

448
00:35:56,747 --> 00:35:58,868
and to be able to pronounce them correctly.

449
00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:02,029
Also you should know the IPA spelling,

450
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:04,406
watch how I move my mouth,

451
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:07,458
and please try to always repeat after me.

452
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:11,201
I know you can do it so let's get started.

453
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:15,345
First, let's try to make the sound /æ/.

454
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:18,480
So your tongue is very low in your mouth.

455
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,739
/æ/
Can you repeat after me?

456
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:30,803
/æ/

457
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:33,638
Let's now use the word, ‘ran’.

458
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:36,447
Repeat after me.

459
00:36:36,447 --> 00:36:45,628
ran

460
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:48,485
And now let's produce the sound /ʌ/.

461
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:53,795
Your tongue is in the middle part of your mouth.
/ʌ/

462
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,466
Please repeat after me.

463
00:36:55,466 --> 00:37:04,268
/ʌ/

464
00:37:04,268 --> 00:37:08,626
Let's now practice with the word ‘run’.

465
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,018
Repeat after me.

466
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:20,533
run

467
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:21,595
Good guys.

468
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:23,489
Let's now use minimal pairs.

469
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:27,565
Words that are very similar, but the vowel
sounds change.

470
00:37:27,565 --> 00:37:30,481
A very good way to practice the vowel sounds.

471
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,587
First, just the sounds.

472
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:34,977
Repeat after me.

473
00:37:34,977 --> 00:37:39,148
And watch how my mouth moves.

474
00:37:39,148 --> 00:37:48,740
/æ/

475
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:57,607
/ʌ/

476
00:37:57,607 --> 00:38:00,000
/æ/

477
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,490
/ʌ/

478
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,463
/æ/

479
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:06,836
/ʌ/

480
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:08,903
/æ/

481
00:38:08,903 --> 00:38:12,064
/ʌ/

482
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:16,009
Let's now use the words ‘ran’ and ‘run’.

483
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:20,707
Please repeat after me.

484
00:38:20,707 --> 00:38:30,000
ran

485
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:38,068
run

486
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:40,152
ran

487
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,850
run

488
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:45,128
ran

489
00:38:45,128 --> 00:38:47,298
run

490
00:38:47,299 --> 00:38:49,612
ran

491
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:52,425
run

492
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,118
Great guys.

493
00:38:54,118 --> 00:38:57,469
Ok, guys.
Let's see other minimal pairs together.

494
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,196
Repeat after me

495
00:38:59,196 --> 00:39:01,819
and pay attention to my mouth

496
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:05,430
how it moves.
Let's get started.

497
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:28,825
Excellent job guys.
Let's carry on.

498
00:44:28,825 --> 00:44:31,394
Okay, guys.
Let's practice further.

499
00:44:31,394 --> 00:44:33,196
I'm going to show you some words.

500
00:44:33,196 --> 00:44:37,778
I want you to read them, but with the proper
vowel sound.

501
00:44:37,778 --> 00:44:39,761
/æ/ or /ʌ/.

502
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,566
Let's get started.

503
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:44,200
Let's start with word number one.

504
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,739
Which one is it?

505
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:52,017

506
00:44:52,017 --> 00:44:53,596

507
00:44:53,596 --> 00:44:54,742

00:45:26,544 --> 00:45:28,912

Okay, guys.
Let's move on to sentences now.

538
00:46:41,312 --> 00:46:47,043
I have sentences for you and they all contain
/æ/ and /ʌ/ sounds.

539
00:46:47,043 --> 00:46:49,850
so pay attention and repeat after me.

Great job, guys.

547
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,216
I know it's hard but you now have a better
understanding of the

548
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:34,447
difference between the English vowel sounds
/æ/ and /ʌ/.

549
00:47:34,447 --> 00:47:35,864
Keep practicing.

550
00:47:35,864 --> 00:47:42,187
It takes time and practice of listening and
speaking to master the English vowel sounds.

551
00:47:42,187 --> 00:47:43,492
But you can do it.

552
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:47,191
And also make sure to watch the rest of my pronunciation
videos.

553
00:47:47,191 --> 00:47:50,330
They're very important if you want to improve
your English skills.

554
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,274
See you next time.

555
00:47:55,727 --> 00:47:58,500

Bye.

562
00:48:19,037 --> 00:48:20,913
Hi guys.
This is F@nny.

563
00:48:20,913 --> 00:48:23,533
Welcome to this English pronunciation video.

564
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:28,707
In this video, I'm gonna focus on two tricky sounds:

565
00:48:28,707 --> 00:48:31,444
/əʊ/ and /ɔ:/

566
00:48:31,444 --> 00:48:33,040
Sounds similar,

567
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,996
but they are very different

568
00:48:34,996 --> 00:48:39,439
and you need to hear the difference and to pronounce them differently.

569
00:48:39,439 --> 00:48:43,101
Let's take two example words
shall we. 

570
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:47,725
The first word is 'so'.

571
00:48:47,725 --> 00:48:49,559
/əʊ/ is the sound.

572
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:50,344
Can you hear it?

573
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,479
'so'

574
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:56,257
The second word is 'saw'.

575
00:48:56,257 --> 00:48:58,002
The sound is /ɔ:/.

576
00:48:58,002 --> 00:48:59,361
Can you hear it?

577
00:48:59,361 --> 00:49:01,122
so /səʊ/

578
00:49:01,122 --> 00:49:03,517
saw /sɔː/

579
00:49:03,517 --> 00:49:06,905
Now I know they sound very similar to most of you.

580
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:08,639
But they are different

581
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,278
and with a little bit of practice, you will improve your skills.

582
00:49:13,278 --> 00:49:16,110
I promise you by the end of this video,

583
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:19,243
you will hear and pronounce them differently.

584
00:49:19,243 --> 00:49:21,383
So keep watching.

585
00:49:23,571 --> 00:49:25,022
Let's go guys!

586
00:49:25,022 --> 00:49:27,363
I'm gonna help you make these sounds

587
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:30,178
/əʊ/ and /ɔ:/ in English.

588
00:49:30,178 --> 00:49:34,565
I want you to hear the difference and to be
able to pronounce them correctly.

589
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:37,661
Also you should know the IPA spelling.

590
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:39,912
Watch how I move my mouth.

591
00:49:39,912 --> 00:49:42,924
And please try to repeat after me.

592
00:49:42,924 --> 00:49:47,067
I know you can do this so let's get to it.

593
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:50,881
First, let's make the sound /əʊ/.

594
00:49:50,881 --> 00:49:54,766
/əʊ/ is actually a diphthong.

595
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:59,047
So it's two vowel sounds /əʊ/.

596
00:49:59,047 --> 00:50:06,302
So as you pronounce it, as you can see,
my mouth is quite round.

597
00:50:06,302 --> 00:50:09,755
It moves and it becomes smaller.

598
00:50:09,755 --> 00:50:12,114
/əʊ/

599
00:50:12,114 --> 00:50:13,469
Let's practice.

600
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,920
Repeat after me.

601
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:23,229
/əʊ/

602
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:26,855
Let's practice now with the word 'so'.

603
00:50:26,855 --> 00:50:28,796
Repeat after me.

604
00:50:28,796 --> 00:50:40,421
so

605
00:50:40,422 --> 00:50:42,319
And now for the sound /ɔ:/.

606
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:48,736
As you can see my mouth is round as well
but it's doesn't move.

607
00:50:48,736 --> 00:50:52,107
And the sound is a tiny bit longer.

608
00:50:52,107 --> 00:50:54,184
/ɔ:/

609
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,230
Let's practice.
Repeat after me.

610
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:06,605
/ɔ:/

611
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:10,137
Let's take the word 'saw'.

612
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:12,251
Please repeat after me.

613
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:21,932
saw

614
00:51:21,932 --> 00:51:23,340
Good.

615
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,776
Let's now use minimal pairs.

616
00:51:24,776 --> 00:51:28,708
Words that are very similar but the vowel
sounds change.

617
00:51:28,708 --> 00:51:32,207
They're a very good way to practice these
vowel sounds.

618
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:35,734
First, let's just practice the sounds.

619
00:51:35,734 --> 00:51:40,754
Watch how my mouth moves and repeat after me.

620
00:51:40,754 --> 00:51:50,392
/əʊ/

621
00:51:50,392 --> 00:51:58,991
/ɔ:/

622
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:01,076
/əʊ/

623
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,896
/ɔ:/

624
00:52:03,896 --> 00:52:06,261
/əʊ/

625
00:52:06,261 --> 00:52:09,317
/ɔ:/

626
00:52:09,317 --> 00:52:11,485
/əʊ/

627
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:14,245
/ɔ:/

628
00:52:14,245 --> 00:52:17,795
Let's now take our words 'so' and 'saw'.

629
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:20,714
Repeat after me.

630
00:52:20,714 --> 00:52:30,000
so

631
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:38,905
saw

632
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,665
so

633
00:52:41,665 --> 00:52:44,720
saw

634
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,283
so

635
00:52:47,283 --> 00:52:49,648
saw

636
00:52:49,648 --> 00:52:51,915
so

637
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,971
saw

638
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:56,634
Excellent guys.

639
00:52:56,635 --> 00:53:01,370
Okay students let's now move on to
minimal pairs together.

640
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,489
I'm gonna read them to you. 
You should repeat after me.

641
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:07,455
And watch my mouth - how it moves.

642
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,266
Let's get started.

643
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,104
Good guys.
Let's carry on.

644
00:56:43,104 --> 00:56:45,732
Okay guys.
Let's practice further.

645
00:56:45,732 --> 00:56:47,912
I'm going to show you a couple of words.

646
00:56:47,912 --> 00:56:51,959
I want you to read them with the proper English vowel sound:

647
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:54,710
/əʊ/ or /ɔ:/

648
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,569
Let's get to.

649
00:56:57,569 --> 00:57:00,343
Let's start with the first word.

650
00:57:00,343 --> 00:57:04,492
Is it stoke or stalk?

651
00:57:04,492 --> 00:57:05,765
Which one is it?

652
00:57:05,765 --> 00:57:08,698
It's stoke.

653
00:57:08,698 --> 00:57:12,574

Very nice.

662
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:48,025
Next word.

663
00:57:48,026 --> 00:57:52,445

664
00:57:52,445 --> 00:57:55,074

Its 'bought'.

668
00:58:05,943 --> 00:58:09,886
Next word.

669
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:14,715
poke or pork?

670
00:58:14,715 --> 00:58:17,672
It's 'pork', guys.

671
00:58:17,672 --> 00:58:21,240
Next word.

672
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:26,445

674
00:58:29,303 --> 00:58:35,649
Then we have 'code' or 'cord'?

675
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:39,455
It's 'cord'.

676
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:42,554
And finally. 

677
00:58:42,554 --> 00:58:47,322
boat or bought?

678
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:51,441

Very nice.

679
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:54,122
That was excellent guys.
Let's move on.

680
00:58:54,232 --> 00:59:01,138
Ok, guys. Moving on to sentences containing
/əʊ/ and /ɔ:/ sounds.

681
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:03,951
So pay attention and repeat after me.

682
00:59:03,951 --> 00:59:06,093
The first sentence,

683
00:59:06,093 --> 00:59:16,343
I saw four crows fly low.

684
00:59:16,343 --> 00:59:18,709
Second sentence. 

685
00:59:18,709 --> 00:59:25,411
Joe chose pork and corn.

686
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:27,200
And finally. 

687
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:36,713
There's more snow on the low shore.

688
00:59:36,713 --> 00:59:38,935
Great guys.
Let's move on.

689
00:59:38,935 --> 00:59:40,225
Great job guys.

690
00:59:40,225 --> 00:59:45,707
You now have a better understanding of the
difference between the English vowel sounds

691
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,964
/əʊ/ and /ɔ:/

692
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:49,635
But keep practicing.

693
00:59:49,635 --> 00:59:52,302
It takes time and practice

694
00:59:52,302 --> 00:59:56,738
speaking and listening to master these vowel sounds.

695
00:59:56,738 --> 00:59:58,104
But you can do!

696
00:59:58,104 --> 01:00:02,737
Also, make sure you watch the rest of my pronunciation videos.

697
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:06,709
Very important if you want to master the English language.

698
01:00:06,709 --> 01:00:08,631
So see you next time.

699
01:00:11,868 --> 01:00:13,941
Thank you so much for watching guys.
