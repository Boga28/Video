1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,520
Do you hate your voice?

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,380
Or do you have a lot of opinions
about how your voice sounds?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,770
Or maybe you think that you need
to change your voice to sound

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,540
more American, or British, or
Australian when speaking English?

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,880
If that's the case for you, and you
feel that you are not happy with how

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,680
you sound in English or in your native
language, then this video is for you.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,320
Because today we are going
to talk about the voice.

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,369
We're going to talk about
how it is formed and created.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,769
And then we're going to talk about
placement and answer the question whether

10
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:37,589
or not English has a specific placement.

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,970
And then finally, I'm going to give
you a few tips on how to find your

12
00:00:42,029 --> 00:00:46,830
optimal voice, where your voice is most
comfortable at and most expressive.

13
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:50,230
And you don't need to
work hard to be heard.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,520
And maybe, maybe you'll start liking
your voice and even loving your voice.

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,630
Are you ready for that?

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,480
I mean, are you ready ready for that?

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,020
Okay.

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:01,800
I hope so.

19
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,090
So let's get started.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,430
By the way, if you're new
to my channel, then hi.

21
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,330

and I am here to help you feel amazing

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,830
when speaking English in your own
voice, speaking authentic English.

24
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,600
And authenticity is definitely
something that we talk about when we

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,550
talk about communicating in English.

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,560
And definitely, when we
talk about the voice.

Oh, and you can also follow me on
Instagram at @hadar.accentsway.

32
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:45,215
So let's talk about the voice.

33
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:47,135
Why is it so important?

34
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:52,445
The voice is such a fundamental
element when it comes to communication.

35
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,605
And not just in English, in
your native language as well.

36
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:57,035
The voice is the first
thing that people hear.

37
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:02,345
And a lot of times, people form
an opinion about someone based on

38
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:06,515
the sound of their voice before
even hearing what they have to say.

39
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:09,750
And we all do that, by the way.

40
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,880
Whether or not we like this person, or
we feel like we can't trust them, we are

41
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,420
engaged or bored when listening to them.

42
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,220
And even beyond this idea of,
you know, how you are being

43
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,769
perceived when you speak.

44
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,930
Because it's definitely not about that.

45
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,420
It's more about you feeling comfortable
and confident with your voice.

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,800
Because a lot of times I hear my students
saying that they don't like their voice.

47
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,170
And even that they hate their voice,
which is a horrible experience.

48
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,090
Because your voice is how you speak.

49
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,160
It's like you hear it all the time.

50
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,780
And if you don't like it, and if you even
hate it, then you probably don't like

51
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,090
anything that comes out of your mouth.

52
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,340
Or you constantly feel that
other people feel the same thing.

53
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,280
And they don't like your voice,
and they have the same opinions

54
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,350
about your voice as you do.

55
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,630
Which is not the case by the way, but
it doesn't help our self-esteem, and

56
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:12,989
it doesn't help our confidence, and it
doesn't help our communication abilities.

57
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,000
Also, when you know how to use your
voice, you feel a lot more expressive.

58
00:03:19,215 --> 00:03:24,165
You feel like you're able to
express an idea in a compelling way.

59
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:28,965
You can express your feelings,
and when you think about things

60
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:31,485
without using words - right?

61
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:35,655
- by using your tone or your intonation.

62
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:39,405
And all of that is a
skill - using your voice.

63
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,505
You just need to understand how it works.

64
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:43,935
And unfortunately, no one teaches that.

65
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:48,614
I mean, you're born learning
how to speak, so that's it.

66
00:03:48,614 --> 00:03:52,005
But then with time, we learned
to manipulate the voice.

67
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:55,545
Maybe we have opinions about
being too loud or being too

68
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:59,114
quiet, or speaking a certain way.

69
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:02,894
Or if I want to sound American, I
need to be higher in pitch, or lower

70
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:04,755
in pitch, or louder, or softer.

71
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:11,774
So all of these ideas that we have about
how we should sound causes to manipulate

72
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:14,144
our voice, sometimes not to our advantage.

73
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:18,735
No, I'm not saying that you
can't use your voice in a better

74
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,595
way, in a more optimal way.

75
00:04:21,015 --> 00:04:24,615
But you want to understand what is right
for you and what is healthy for you.

76
00:04:24,975 --> 00:04:30,225
And also learn that the way you
sound is probably how you need to

77
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:32,805
sound, and be comfortable with that.

78
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:39,675
Even if it's not this idea or ideal
that you have about the voice.

79
00:04:40,035 --> 00:04:43,095
So let's begin by understanding
how the voice works.

80
00:04:43,905 --> 00:04:47,745
So, the voice needs
three elements to exist.

81
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:53,165
One is the power source or the
energy, and that is the breath.

82
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:55,565
Without breath, there is no voice.

83
00:04:56,415 --> 00:05:01,530
Then we need the vibrator where the
voice is actually created, and that is

84
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,110
the vocal folds or vocal chords that are
right here, I'll talk about that in a sec.

85
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,200
And then we need the resonators - the
space for the voice to enhance,

86
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,560
and become stronger and louder.

87
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,760
So, we start with a
breath, we need to inhale.

88
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,870
And the more breath you have
and the deeper the breath is,

89
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,390
the stronger the voice is.

90
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,590
Think about it, that's the energy source.

91
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,370
So, if you tend to take shallow breaths,
let's say, just to your chest, or very

92
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:40,950
short breaths, then you're not going to
have enough power to support your voice.

93
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:48,330
So breath is such an important element
when it comes to using your optimal voice.

94
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,659
I recommend practicing belly breathing.

95
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,840
Now, I'm going to link to a few
videos that teach you how to do that.

96
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,290
But if you've ever done yoga or
meditation, you should know what belly

97
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,250
breathing is, where you breathe into
your belly and not into your chest.

98
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,659
In fact, I have a full interview that
I've conducted with a friend of mine about

99
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,799
breath, and I'm going to link to it below.

100
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,164
So, to make a long story short, you want
to practice belly breathing and to breathe

101
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:23,055
into your belly, so you have more breath
in your body every time you take a breath.

102
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:24,224
Okay.

103
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:29,685
So you take a breath, you expand, and
then you exhale it or you release it.

104
00:06:29,984 --> 00:06:33,345
And the breath goes
through the vocal cords.

105
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:37,845
Now, the vocal chords are
right here inside the vocal

106
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:40,815
box, also called the larynx.

107
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:42,855
And the vocal box is right here.

108
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:44,595
You can feel that little bump here.

109
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,095
For men it's more noticeable..

110
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:51,065
And you can put your fingers here
and even hum, you can feel it moving.

111
00:06:52,961 --> 00:06:54,005
A lot of vibrations.

112
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:58,155
And the breath passes between the
vocal cords, that are muscles that

113
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,985
open and close the vocal cords.

114
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:05,375
And the vocal chords vibrate
and create this sound.

115
00:07:05,998 --> 00:07:09,765
The sound is not very loud when
it's created in the larynx.

116
00:07:10,455 --> 00:07:13,515
And the vocal chords vibrate.

117
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:17,175
And when the frequency is really
high, when they vibrate really

118
00:07:17,175 --> 00:07:19,021
fast, the pitch is higher.

119
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:24,695
And when they vibrate a little
slower, then the pitch is lower.

120
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:32,895
Now, the voice then moves
up the vocal tract and start

121
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:35,985
resonating in different spaces.

122
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:41,625
So, for the voice to enhance and
to become louder, it needs to

123
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,175
bounce around in an empty space.

124
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:49,075
Now let's think, what are the empty
spaces that we have in our mouth or face?

125
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:55,919
We have the throat right
behind the vocal box.

126
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,989
It's called the
pharynx - the throat itself.

127
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:02,609
The back of the throat.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,030
The mouth itself, that's a big space.

129
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,390
So this is why when you open your
mouth for the open vowel sounds,

130
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:16,080
for example: 'ah' and 'aa', you
create more space inside your mouth

131
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,920
for the voice to vibrate, which
changes the quality of the sound.

132
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,190
Right?

133
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,760
So when you drop your jaw and you
create more space in your mouth,

134
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:27,960
your voice is usually a little louder
because it has more room to vibrate.

135
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,479
More places for the voice to
vibrate: we said the mouth, right?

136
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,080
Nose.

137
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,110
Nasal passages.

138
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:47,895
Now the sound waves are created here,
but then they move around the body,

139
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:53,245
and they bounce against hard elements.

140
00:08:53,915 --> 00:08:56,805
In our case, the bones, right?

141
00:08:56,805 --> 00:09:04,125
We have the cheekbones, and the skull,
and the chest - chest bones, the ribs.

142
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:08,055
So these are bones that
also vibrate with the voice.

143
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:16,814
Now, lower notes, lower frequencies,
tend to vibrate with the chest bone.

144
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:22,515
So the chest tends to vibrate with
lower notes, while the head and the

145
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:28,041
cheekbones and all the parts here
tend to vibrate with higher notes.

146
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:35,775
Where your voice is at, whether it's
your chest, or your mouth, or your

147
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:42,885
nose, or your head, that's your vocal
placement - where you place your voice.

148
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:46,814
And when it resonates and enhanced.

149
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:47,714
Okay?

150
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:52,635
So it resonates in the spaces,
but it's enhanced by adding higher

151
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,495
notes, right, like that high pitch.

152
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:57,974
And then it's more head
voice and mask resonance.

153
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:03,074
Or if you add lower notes, and then
it's more chest voice, and that's

154
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:05,354
a deeper quality of the voice.

155
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:13,454
Now, a lot of times people talk about
English as if it has a certain placement.

156
00:10:13,944 --> 00:10:18,104
A language doesn't have a
placement, people have placement.

157
00:10:18,435 --> 00:10:23,564
And here's the thing, I might use my
placement differently, based on what I'm

158
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:26,204
saying or the context of the situation.

159
00:10:26,385 --> 00:10:34,155
For example, If I'm speaking to my friend
on the phone and I want to be funny or

160
00:10:34,155 --> 00:10:37,185
sarcastic, I might just go lower in pitch.

161
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:43,065
If I want to be flirting with them,
I'm going to go to my lower notes.

162
00:10:43,365 --> 00:10:49,035
And then if I need to call my friend from
across the street, I might move to my

163
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:51,435
mask resonance so they hear me better.

164
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,115
"Hey, how are you doing?"

165
00:10:54,345 --> 00:10:57,825
Or sometimes I might use my head voice.

166
00:10:58,095 --> 00:10:58,645
"What?

167
00:10:58,945 --> 00:11:00,525
What are you talking about?

168
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:01,725
No way!"

169
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:02,265
Right?

170
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:06,855
And I use that to express
an emotion and my tone.

171
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:12,105
So we constantly shift between
placements based on the situation,

172
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:16,605
based on our tone of voice, and
based on what we want to say.

173
00:11:17,295 --> 00:11:23,835
Also, every person has their own
natural placement, where their

174
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:25,785
voice is most comfortable at.

175
00:11:26,055 --> 00:11:30,615
For some people it's a little lower,
for some people it's a little higher.

176
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:35,475
Because this is also the structure of
your vocal chords and how thick they

177
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:38,025
are, and the shape of your mouth.

178
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:42,165
So, you definitely don't want to
compare yourself to someone else

179
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:45,900
when you're exploring the voice, but
you might want to take some elements

180
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,520
about how they use their voice
maybe, or how expressive they are.

181
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:54,090
And not try to imitate someone
else's voice, because it might not

182
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,000
be aligned with your own voice.

183
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,580
People have different voices.

184
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:05,130
So you want to understand what
feels right for you, what feels

185
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,380
right when you are using your voice.

186
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:12,310
And how can you use your voice so that
you are effortless and expressive.

187
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,250
That is the most important thing.

188
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,110
Even if it's a little higher than
what you had intended it to be or

189
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,250
what you had thought that your voice
should sound like, or even when it's

190
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,130
lower than what you had planned.

191
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:26,970
Right?

192
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,330
So, the most important thing
is to be connected with your

193
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,490
voice and with your sound.

194
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,090
Now, how do you find that optimal voice?

195
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,400
Here's the thing.

196
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,180
Let's begin with the fact that if your
voice is too high or too low, you're

197
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,270
going to be a little less expressive
because you'll have less play.

198
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,040
English is a very varied language.

199
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,080
You use your pitch continuously,
whether it's about going up or going

200
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,460
down when trying to say something, or
up when you want to stress something.

201
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,330
And you always hear this
melody going up and down.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,630
And if you stuck down here, there's
very little room for you to be

203
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,920
expressive with your voice, and to
express your feelings and emotions; and

204
00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:12,340
even to deliver your message clearly.

205
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,410
Same thing if you're stuck up here and
you're not using your voice a lot, and

206
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,610
you're not playing with your pitch.

207
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,410
That's also preventing you from a very
essential element of communication.

208
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,330
So ideally, you want to
use your middle voice.

209
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:31,650
And your middle voice, by the
way, is usually the place where

210
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,480
your voice is most comfortable at.

211
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,550
And it's called the optimum pitch level.

212
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,000
I've already discussed it on another
video where I talk about changing

213
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,540
your voice in English, and I'm going
to link to that video below if you'd

214
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,520
like to learn more about the voice.

215
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:49,860
And I have also a video about fun
exercises that you can do to feel

216
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,540
more powerful with your voice.

217
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,550
But back to our story.

218
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,420
What is the optimum voice,
the optimum pitch level?

219
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:03,540
Your optimum pitch level is, like I
said, the place where your voice is

220
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:06,240
most comfortable at and most effortless.

221
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,310
And that is the place where you hum.

222
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,219
'Mmmmm'.

223
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,220
Your hum is usually your
optimum pitch level.

224
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,670
'Hmmmm'.

225
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,090
'How are you doing?' 'How are you doing?'

226
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:25,469
Now, if you hum and your voice that
comes out is very different than the

227
00:14:25,469 --> 00:14:30,750
voice that you usually use when speaking,
this is something to explore, right?

228
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:37,410
Because maybe, just maybe, you're speaking
lower than your optimum pitch level, or

229
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,359
higher than your optimum pitch level.

230
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:43,920
And again, there's nothing wrong with
that, if you feel 100% comfortable.

231
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:46,740
But if you feel that you're not
expressive, that you're straining

232
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,040
your voice when speaking and you
feel exhausted at the end of the day,

233
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,319
I would definitely look into that.

234
00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:56,699
Because sometimes when our voice
is too high or too low, and we feel

235
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:02,370
that we are not heard and we want
to increase the volume, we might

236
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,290
strain our voice while doing it.

237
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,310
Instead of just placing it in the
right placement, where the mouth

238
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:12,060
already does all the work, because
you have all the resonators.

239
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:17,530
So why not use whatever is naturally there
already, without straining your voice?

240
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,439
So, another way to find your optimum
pitch level is by going really low.

241
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:36,310
And then you want to push your belly,
your diaphragm actually, a few times.

242
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:36,980
Let's do it again.

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,050
Go really low.

244
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,573
You hear that the voice
goes up really quickly.

245
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,709
That's the optimum pitch level.

246
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,610
So you can try that too, and you can
try the hum and see what feels right.

247
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:59,370
Now, I'm not saying this
should be your voice.

248
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,360
I'm saying that understanding that this
is your middle voice, and this is where

249
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,949
your voice is most comfortable at.

250
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,370
You can start with that and
you can start exploring that.

251
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:13,949
And then, remember, that you can
definitely go a little lower and a little

252
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,829
higher, and use all your resonators.

253
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:22,439
And when you speak a little lower - not
too low, but a little lower - you

254
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,810
add all the resonants of the chest,
which usually has this deeper,

255
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,270
darker, richer quality to your voice.

256
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:34,170
But sometimes, you might want
to use more of your head voice.

257
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,230
So ideas about, "Oh, my voice is too high.

258
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,630
My voice is too nasal". 

259
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,064
I mean, yes, sometimes we use
more nasality in our voice.

260
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:45,795
And that's especially the case
if you have a lot of nasal

261
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,834
vowels in your native language.

262
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:51,915
And yes, you don't have to use
them, if we don't have nasal vowels.

263
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:55,905
And understanding how to
use your mouth or your chest

264
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:58,694
resonance instead can serve you.

265
00:16:59,055 --> 00:17:02,324
But it doesn't mean that there is
something wrong with your voice.

266
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:07,494
The idea is to understand how
to use everything entirely.

267
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,339
Now, to understand how to use your
resonators, like I said, I have a video

268
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:16,980
with a bunch of fun exercises to help you
explore the versatility of your voice.

269
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,260
And I'm going to link to
it in the description.

270
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,250
Okay, that's it.

271
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
Now I want to hear from you.

272
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,040
Do you find yourself having
negative thoughts about your voice?

273
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,539
If so, what are they?

274
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,200
You can share them in the comments and
see that, first of all, you're not alone.

275
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,100
But also I would be more than happy
to support you, and see if there's

276
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,350
anything else I can help you with.

277
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,550
Also, I have a task for you to
find someone that you really love

278
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,560
their voice and how they use it.

279
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:48,840
And start asking yourself
question why you like it so much.

280
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,150
What is it about their quality of voice?

281
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,730
Is it because you feel
that they're expressive?

282
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,650
Because you understand their feelings?

283
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,690
Because you feel that they're connected.

284
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,110
So, I want you to ask yourself
all of these questions.

285
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,550
And then if you have any insights, share
them in the comments with us below.

286
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:10,830
Or come on over to Instagram at
@hadar.accentsway and send me a DM.

287
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,790
All right.

288
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,020
That's it for today.

289
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,480
Thank you so, so much for being here.

290
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,660
Remember, loving your voice
is so incredibly important.

291
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:22,440
Because if you don't love your
voice, you will believe that no

292
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,850
one is going to love your voice.

293
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,375
And that is not healthy, my friend, for
anything related to life or communication.

294
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:35,055
And also, when you start loving your
voice, you start enjoying recording

295
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:37,215
yourself and hearing yourself on video.

296
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,955
And that is also something that
you want to incorporate more into

297
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,555
your life, especially when it
comes to practicing your English.

298
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:46,395
All right.

299
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:48,315
Have a beautiful,
beautiful rest of the day.

300
00:18:48,345 --> 00:18:50,595
And I'll see you next
week in the next video.

301
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:51,615
Bye.
