00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:07,130
Hello, my name is Emma, and in today's video,
I'm going to teach you a simple grammar point,

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:11,460
and that is how we can use infinitives to
give a reason for something.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,460
Okay?

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:16,730
So, in this video, I'm going to teach you
what an infinitive is and how we use it in

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,730
this way.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,020
So, let's get started.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:28,740
So, like I said, we use an infinitive verb
to say why someone does something.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,800
So, let's look at some examples.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,640
I took a shower - why?

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,840
To relax.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,530
I worked - why?

12
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,579
What's the reason?

13
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:44,910
I worked to make money.

14
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,910
Okay?

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:52,190
So, what I'm doing here is I'm showing you
part of a sentence and then, at the end, is

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,110
an infinitive verb that shows the reason why.

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:04,180
So, an infinitive is when you have the preposition
"to" + the base verb.

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,570
So, what's the base verb?

19
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:12,729
It means it's a verb that's not conjugated,
it's not in any tense, so for example, "to

20
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:15,969
be" is an infinitive verb.

21
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:22,840
Are, is, was, those are not the infinitive
verb, "to be" is the infinitive verb.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,659
I have some other examples here.

23
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:35,060
"To eat", "to make", "to do", so an infinitive
verb is the verb before you conjugate it,

24
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,179
and again, it has that preposition "to".

25
00:01:38,179 --> 00:01:43,759
So, I want you to tell me, what is the infinitive
verb in our first example?

26
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,289
"I took a shower to relax."

27
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:53,959
So, the infinitive verb is "to relax".

28
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,489
What about in our second example?

29
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:01,770
"I worked to make money."

30
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,889
If you said "to make" is the infinitive, you're
correct.

31
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:09,709
I know I put a box around it so it might seem
a little simple, but those are examples of

32
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:10,799
infinitive verbs.

33
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:17,090
So, again, we use infinitive verbs to give
the reason why we do something.

34
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,569
So now, let's look at some more examples.

35
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,480
Okay, so let's look at another example.

36
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,430
She came, why did she come?

37
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,319
Well, one example might be, "She came to dance."

38
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,310
"She came to see friends."

39
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,659
She came to meet people.

40
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:45,939
So notice we have "to" which is the preposition
of an infinitive, and then we have the verb,

41
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:52,909
in this case we can add "meet".

42
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:58,359
Can you think of an example using a verb to
answer why she came?

43
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:03,060
I know there's not a lot of information, so
there's a lot of different answers you could

44
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:05,080
say.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,840
Let's look at some other examples.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,999
I want you to think about the reason: Why
do you go to the library?

47
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:22,230
Some people might say "You go to the library
to read."

48
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,379
Now, I want you to think, what part of the
sentence is the infinitive?

49
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:30,590
That is the part that is giving the reason.

50
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:39,969
What we have here, the preposition "to" and
the base verb "read", so "to read" is the

51
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,030
infinitive.

52
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,819
And that's also the reason why we go to the
library.

53
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,890
Now, I want you to think about the cinema.

54
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,390
Why do you go to the cinema, what's the reason?

55
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,800
You go to the cinema maybe to watch movies.

56
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,450
So, what part is the infinitive verb in this?

57
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:10,689
So again, we have the preposition "to" and
the base verb, which is "watch".

58
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:13,569
This is the infinitive.

59
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,228
You go to the cinema to watch movies.

60
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:23,310
Let's look at another example: why do you
go to the gym?

61
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:30,250
Some of you might say you go to the gym to
work out, or to get strong.

62
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,039
What's another reason why you might go to
the gym?

63
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:41,830
Maybe to check people out, I don't know, there's
a lot of reasons why you might go to the gym.

64
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,450
Maybe you want to train, okay?

65
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,830
So, this is just one example.

66
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,410
You go to the gym, and what part is the infinitive?

67
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:56,919
Well again, you need the preposition "to",
in this case "work out" is the verb.

68
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:03,750
Okay, now I want you to imagine this: your
grandmother or grandfather or somebody you

69
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,180
know has never used the internet before, and
they want to know more about the internet,

70
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:14,720
and so they ask you "Why do you use YouTube?"

71
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,340
What can you tell them?

72
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:31,500
Well, one example might be "You use you YouTube
to", so we have the infinitive, maybe "study

73
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,760
English".

74
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,319
I use YouTube to watch cat videos.

75
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,599
Okay?

76
00:05:42,599 --> 00:05:47,150
I use YouTube to watch old TV shows.

77
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,290
So, you can think about the reasons why you
do something and, again, you use the preposition

78
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,780
"to" and the base verb.

79
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,780
What about Tinder?

80
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,449
I don't know if people are still using Tinder,
but if they are, if you know what Tinder is,

81
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:07,840
why would you use Tinder?

82
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:18,509
You use Tinder to meet people, maybe.

83
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:22,340
Maybe you use Tinder to find a girlfriend
or a boyfriend.

84
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,680
Maybe you use Tinder to hook up with people.

85
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,330
So, again, this is giving the reason why you
do something.

86
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,310
Why do you go to university?

87
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,050
You go to university to learn.

88
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,470
Why do you go to a restaurant?

89
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,980
You go to a restaurant to eat good food.

90
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,700
So, these are just some more examples of the
infinitive.

91
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,440
Now, let's learn about a way to use this in
a more formal sentence.

92
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,560
So, sometimes we might want to make our English
more formal.

93
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,080
So, we might want to do this if we're writing
an essay for university or if we're doing

94
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,539
a presentation at work.

95
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,430
So, more formal is when you use more serious
English.

96
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,879
So, how can we explain a reason by using more
serious English?

97
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,090
Well, we can use the expression "in order
to".

98
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,510
It's similar to what we've just been doing,
but again, this is the more formal way.

99
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,919
So, let's look at some examples.

100
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:29,150
"People use EngVid in order to learn for free."

101
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:35,270
So, if you look at this example, we still
have our infinitive verb.

102
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,319
Can you tell me what the infinitive verb is
in this?

103
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,530
"To learn", okay?

104
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,639
So, we have our preposition "to" here and
then we have the base verb "learn".

105
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,789
Before we have "to learn", we have the words
"in order", so this again is giving a reason.

106
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:59,139
We could also say "People use EngVid to learn
for free" if we didn't want to use this, but

107
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:04,159
to make it more formal we can add the words
"in order" before.

108
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,070
What's another example of this?

109
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:16,790
Maybe "People drink water in order to be less
thirsty.", okay?

110
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,470
So, again, this is another example of using
"in order to".

111
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,610
Now, if we want to say something in the negative,
okay, we want to prevent something, we can

112
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:30,289
also use "in order not to".

113
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,909
So, let's look an example of this.

114
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:40,829
"I walked quietly in order not to wake you."

115
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,420
So, the reason that I'm walking quietly, why
are you walking quietly?

116
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,180
I don't want to wake you up.

117
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:56,070
So, I've put that in the sentence: I walked
quietly in order not to wake you.

118
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,470
So, in this case, it's almost similar to the
structure of this sentence, the only difference

119
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:09,140
is we've added the word "not" here, because
we don't want to wake you up.

120
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,460
What's the infinitive in this example?

121
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,460
To wake.

122
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:20,480
So again, we have our preposition and the
verb "wake".

123
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,590
Let's look at another example: "I stayed up"
I stayed up late, this was true when I was

124
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:33,870
a child, "I stayed up late in order not to
miss Santa Claus."

125
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,390
Okay, I was really scared of not seeing Santa
Claus when I was a kid, so I stayed up very

126
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,510
late in order not to miss Santa Claus.

127
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,250
So, that's the reason I stayed up late.

128
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,140
So, we've covered a lot in this video.

129
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,550
You've learned what an infinitive is, you've
seen a lot of different examples, and you've

130
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,990
also learned how you can use "in order to",
if you want to make something more formal

131
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:06,990
or "in order not to" if you want to make a
negative sentence or to give a negative reason.

132
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,670
So, thank you for watching this video.

133
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,320
I have some homework for you in order to help
you learn more English.

134
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:26,580
Here is your homework: I want you, in the
comments section, to write why you study English,

135
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,770
and I want you to use and infinitive to explain.

136
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,640
"I study English to _______."

137
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,720
Maybe it could be "I study English to have
a better future."

138
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,020
"I study English to meet people."

139
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,670
Whatever the reason, or maybe to read English
books, to watch English movies, I want you

140
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,690
to think of one reason why you're learning
English and to use the infinitive and write

141
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,390
a sentence about it in our comments section.

142
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:03,690
I also invite you to come check out our website
