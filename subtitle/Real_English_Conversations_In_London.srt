00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,400
welcome back to another episode of real
English with real teachers we are back

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:10,230
on the streets of London to expose you
to some naturally spoken English so

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,360
let's see who we find today

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,480
what's the first thing you notice when you meet someone new

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,641
their hair
yeah what if they're wearing a hat

6
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:24,880
if they're bald or not
okay

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,680
what is the first thing you notice
when you meet someone

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,500
their face

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,460
before we start the video we
wanted to tell you about a language

10
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,840
learning platform that Harry and I have
been using heavily for the last two

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,600
years this website is called italki
and we love it not only because it's

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,059
convenient and it's user friendly it's
also super affordable but furthermore

13
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,190
it's connecting you with an actual
native teacher so we highly recommend

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,890
you check out italki just how Charles has
done as a professional football player

15
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:15,090
who's just joined Arsenal and we're
gonna see how he likes italki thank

16
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,620
you for giving us 20 seconds of your
time Charles

17
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,660
it is not a problem not at all

18
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,950
can you quickly tell the

19
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,439
fans why you decided to come to italki
and learn online instead of staying in

20
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:36,000
the traditional classroom 
yes it is quite simple really I could not get to

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,259
the class because I am playing football all
day it is a very intensive training so

22
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,660
online is a very convenient for me
to practice my English

23
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,490
Thank You Charles

24
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,509

so we hope you enjoy that enjoy the

30
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,480
video name the first thing that you
notice when you meet somebody new

31
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,380
oh their eyes

32
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,720
why are the eyes so special
cuz you look into them first

33
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,880
that's how you see anyway yeah
or if they have pretty eyes

34
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,319
yeah
and you like them

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,000
if they're just dull eyes then
well then you pretend like they're pretty for their sake

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,340
I think mouth in my case 
oh right

37
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,460
I tend to look at people being slightly deaf I think I lip read a bit you know

38
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:56,080
and so I tend to look at people's mouths
rather than their eyes

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,600
anything else that's really important 
their smile yeah

40
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,900
okay

41
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,080
what's the first thing you notice when
you meet someone new their eyes their

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:13,900
teeth okay do you look into their dental records
[laughter] no

43
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,340
do you like it if they've got glasses is that a deal breaker 
I don't care

44
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,300
you don't care contact lenses
I don't care, no

45
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,360
take anything
yeah

46
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,459
their smile probably generally speaking
British people are quite stereotypically

47
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,100
bad with smiling at people in the street but
oh really

48
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,880
I think it's quite important in this day and age so yeah

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:48,160
their face or like their outfit
what did you think when you first saw our outfits

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,800
studenty [laughter]
that's a good one

51
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,780
yeah d'you know what I mean 
I do yeah I feel quite studenty

52
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,520
yeah 
yeah something like that

53
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,500
I think it's me trying to hold

54
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,340
on to my youth 
yeah cling to the last shreds

55
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,439
what's something
that you notice about someone when you

56
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,411
meet them instantly
instantly how good-looking they are

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,000
how good-looking they are

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,340
would you say in New Zealand
people are more smiley yeah I'd say that

59
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,699
I'd say that I think that people just
get a bad rep and especially big cities

60
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:29,199
like London for being busy and not very
approachable but most Londoners I

61
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,540
feel they are quite approachable
good

62
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:36,190
do you make a conscious effort to just stare at the

63
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,880
mouth or do you go back and forth
between the eyes and the

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,840
mouth or yeah well I think you should
look people in the eyes they expect it

65
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,000
so I make that conscious effort yeah
you look at your person's face yes and

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,919
then you ask questions and hopefully you
get a feeling for what sort of person

67
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,020
they are yeah in a short period of time

68
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,389
do you think it's strange because I

69
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,380
was talking to Charlie about this the
other day he said if you look at someone

70
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,880
in the eyes for longer than five seconds
people get a bit weirded out they feel

71
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:15,440
uneasy how do you feel about that 
no I wouldn't never experienced that no

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,400
I s'pose [suppose] yeah perhaps you're right looking at you now yeah [laughter]

73
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,260
I am not like my wife she very much

74
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,360
looks at the person and decides what
they're like before even having their

75
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,620
conversation which annoys me intensely
because there are beauty is only

76
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,490
skin-deep some people have very piercing
eyes don't they

77
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:44,080
yeah like Hitler
the Hitler stare

78
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,240
his eyes were very distinctive apparently
yeah he had a very piercing menacing gaze

79
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,660
yeah well you haven't you have lovely soft eyes

80
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,760
so you like to give them a bit more time
yeah I do yeah

81
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,800
does your wife give them a second chance
no

82
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,500
no right so she's quite cut-throat
yeah

83
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,900
anything else that you notice first thing
what about with your wife what did you

84
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,250
I suppose you notice the way they're

85
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,520
dressed don't you and you form an impression about them by the way they're dressed I suppose

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,380
and you kind of expect a certain style of
dress with certain people don't you I

87
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,620
mean I would look at these youngsters
over here and everyone is wearing trainers

88
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,900
you know there's not one proper pair of
shoes amongst them and that's the way they are

89
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,440
I mean like today I'm wearing a
jacket I'm not wearing a tie but

90
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,560
you look dapper you look very
dapper the hat the long coat the shoes

91
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,100
yeah I mean not many people

92
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,460
have proper raincoats these days I don't suppose
no

93
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,000
and that's a hangover from when I was at

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
work you know so 
yeah

95
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,340
still got it when I retired
you've got style I think the older generations have a lot

96
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,960
more style than we do nowadays so we're going to leave
Harry there to reminisce over the older

97
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,580
generation and they're less studenty
appearance and ask you the same question

98
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,050
we asked these lovely members of the
public which is what is the first thing

you notice about someone when you meet
