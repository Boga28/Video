00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
[David Attenborough] Just 50 years ago,

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
we finally ventured to the moon.

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,795
For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,683
Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.

5
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,651
This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
and reveal what we must preserve

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,868
to ensure people and nature thrive.

8
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,843
The Earth still has sanctuaries,

9
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:40,892
and, on occasion, they hold
spectacular gatherings of wildlife.

10
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:52,362
They provide vital space,
but they're disappearing fast.

11
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,913
[wildebeest lowing]

12
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,734
A fifth of the land 
on our planet is covered by desert.

13
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,953
The driest of all
is the Atacama in South America.

14
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,502
There are places here
where rain has never been recorded.

15
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,894
Deserts may appear to be barren and empty,

16
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,776
but they are of crucial importance
to life.

17
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,670
For those that can overcome
their challenges,

18
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,215
they provide a vital refuge.

19
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:22,971
[wind whistling]

20
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,023
Socotran cormorants,

21
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,903
emerging from a dust storm
in the Arabian desert.

22
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:52,000
It is the very emptiness of this landscape
that has brought them here,

23
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,299
and they have come in immense numbers.

24
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,052
[birds squawking]

25
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,932
Fifty thousand of them.

26
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,149
A quarter of the total population.

27
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,368
They have come
because here they can breed...

28
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,954
undisturbed.

29
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,181
But nesting in a desert is difficult.

30
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,936
Temperatures can reach 40 degrees Celsius.

31
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,192
Yet, both the adults
and their white chicks

32
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,194
are ready for this challenge.

33
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:03,279
[birds panting]

34
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,201
They cool themselves 
by panting.

35
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:20,797
Any adult that appears to have food
in its crop is mobbed.

36
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,303
An adult will only give food
to its own chick,

37
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,349
which must be here somewhere.

38
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,614
The chicks chase an adult
out into the desert.

39
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,331
No luck.

40
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,294
Now, they must get back quickly
to the safety of the colony.

41
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,931
This desert provides the cormorants

42
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,934
with more than just a secure refuge.

43
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,996
Every morning, a mass movement begins.

44
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,177
It's the rush hour.

45
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,997
A shallow arm of the sea,
right beside the colony,

46
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,082
is full of food.

47
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,502
[cawing]

48
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,215
This richness comes
from the desert itself.

49
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,551
Dust, blown from the land,

50
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,181
contains nutrients
that fertilize the surrounding waters.

51
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:49,570
So, it is the desert itself
that enriches the sea.

52
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:22,520
In Oman, during the summer monsoon,
fogs roll in from the sea,

53
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,107
billowing over the Dhofar mountains.

54
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,579
The mists bring just enough moisture
to sustain a little vegetation...

55
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:51,882
and this sparse greenery
becomes a focus for life.

56
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:06,105
Ibex must cross the near vertical cliffs
to reach one of the few springs.

57
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,985
But they're nervous...

58
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,572
and with good reason.

59
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,498
An Arabian leopard,

60
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,879
one of less than 200
that survive in the wild.

61
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,217
This male's territory

62
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:42,266
extends over 350 square kilometers
of high mountains and deep wadis.

63
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,403
The southern edge
of the Arabian Peninsula

64
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,407
is one of the few places left
where there is enough prey

65
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,036
to sustain a population of these leopards.

66
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,380
But even so, there are probably
less than 60 individuals

67
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,175
in over 15,000 square kilometers.

68
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,560
These leopards have always been rare,

69
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,024
but now conflict with people

70
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,695
is causing their numbers
to decline still further.

71
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,989
[bird chirps]

72
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,502
Few leopards are left,

73
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:58,050
so what our hidden cameras now capture
verges on the miraculous.

74
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,892
A female leopard,

75
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,188
and she is tracking a male.

76
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,374
Such meetings
are becoming increasingly rare.

77
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:51,854
[growling]

78
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,902
This briefest of unions

79
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,531
may ensure
the short-term future for these leopards.

80
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,955
But in the longer term,

81
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,293
their fate will depend
on their territory being protected.

82
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,261
To the north of the Dhofar mountains

83
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,058
lies a place
of almost unimaginable emptiness.

84
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,186
The Rub' al Khali,

85
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,481
the Empty Quarter.

86
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,784
The very name of the place

87
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,288
resonates with the romance
of these desert lands.

88
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,342
This is the largest sand sea
in the world.

89
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,767
There are parts
where human beings never venture.

90
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:21,068
Only the greatest desert specialists
can survive here.

91
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,535
Arabian oryx.

92
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,666
Their ranges are vast,

93
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,879
extending
for over 3,000 square kilometers.

94
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,261
This is one of their last refuges.

95
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,518
Once hunted close to extinction,

96
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,564
they have now reclaimed
their ancestral territory.

97
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:07,156
With the help of conservationists,
they have returned home.

98
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:15,581
But reintroduction
cannot save all desert animals.

99
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:17,958
[elephants huffing]

100
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,720
Desert elephants.

101
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,812
Less than 150 survive, here in Namibia.

102
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:48,197
This oldest of deserts
is scarred by dry riverbeds,

103
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:53,577
carved by water that flows
for only one or two days in a year.

104
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,959
An adult elephant

105
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:06,340
must find up to 200 kilos of food
each and every day if it's not to starve.

106
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,726
So, for these last survivors,
life is an endless trek.

107
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:29,321
The herd is guided by a single old female,
the matriarch.

108
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,243
She is leading her family

109
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,080
to a special place
where food should be available

110
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,873
even in a drought.

111
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,383
She learned of its existence
from her mother,

112
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,093
many years ago.

113
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,099
Now, she's teaching her own calf
how to get there.

114
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,860
The elephants are not alone
in their search for food.

115
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,076
Desert lions.

116
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,748
They are just as rare as the elephants.

117
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,010
The calf is protected by its mother.

118
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,020
So the lions let them pass.

119
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,071
Distant trees are a sign of water.

120
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,531
[brays]

121
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,763
The riverbed is dry.

122
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,688
The ana trees, however, are still green.

123
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,405
But there is a problem.

124
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,743
At this time of year,

125
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,997
seedpods from the ana trees
usually litter the ground.

126
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,461
Rich food for elephants.

127
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,094
But this year, the crop has failed.

128
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:06,562
The matriarch
has led her herd here for nothing.

129
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,824
Even the trees' leafy branches
are out of their reach.

130
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:26,540
The family has no option but to move on.

131
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,562
A bull, standing nearly four meters tall.

132
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,983
He can reach into the canopy,

133
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,738
and he could be the solution
to their problem.

134
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:07,581
The old female has known him all her life
and turned to him for help before.

135
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,594
Elephants can only survive here

136
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,056
because of knowledge
passed down over generations.

137
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,811
But less than 20 matriarchs still survive,

138
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,191
and if their knowledge is lost,

139
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,528
elephants may no longer
be able to live here.

140
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,793
Deserts cannot support
large numbers of animals the year round,

141
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,090
and even those specially adapted
to these conditions

142
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,218
can only survive in small numbers.

143
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,306
But on very special occasions,

144
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,560
deserts are transformed.

145
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,646
[thunder rumbling]

146
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,069
Once in a decade,

147
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,489
there may be a cloudburst.

148
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,753
A single one can turn the desert green.

149
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,265
In southern California,

150
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,476
the change is visible from space.

151
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,200
Hundreds of square kilometers
suddenly bloom.

152
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,971
If such transformations become regular,

153
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,891
a new habitat may develop.

154
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,062
Grasslands.

155
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,940
One of our planet's
most productive landscapes.

00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:50,535
They support the greatest aggregations
of large animals on Earth.

157
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:58,293
The Serengeti sustains herds
of over a million wildebeest.

00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,636
They follow the rains
to crop the newly sprung grass.

159
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,236
These vast herds attract predators.

Five male cheetahs.

00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,713
One of the largest coalitions
ever observed.

They dominate a territory
of 450 square kilometers.

163
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,690
They patrol it together,

164
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,194
and that attracts attention.

00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,246
A change of strategy is needed

168
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,999
if they're to hunt successfully.

169
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,385
They need cover.

170
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,755
An adult wildebeest
is a formidable opponent.

171
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,984
Four of the cheetahs start the stalk,

172
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,320
walking directly towards the prey.

173
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,785
The fifth creeps around the side.

174
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:54,946
They need to get really close
before making their final sprint.

175
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,501
They're nearly there.

176
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,872
All five break cover,

177
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,584
each cat chasing a different target.

178
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,309
It's chaos.

179
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:16,528
A single cheetah
is not strong enough to defend its prize.

180
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,460
They must work together.

181
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:19,507
These dramas only continue
because the Serengeti is protected,

182
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,636
and has been for over 65 years.

183
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,309
But the Serengeti is an exception.

184
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:37,901
Across the planet, space for grasslands
has been steadily disappearing.

185
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,571
[huffs]

186
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:48,203
A hundred and eighty years ago,
herds of bison, millions strong,

187
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,581
grazed the Great Plains
of North America.

188
00:29:55,335 --> 00:30:00,089
They roamed across a prairie
a hundred times larger than the Serengeti.

189
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,683
This was the true wild west.

190
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,366
[roaring]

191
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,911
Every summer,
the males roared their challenges

192
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,415
and fought for possession of the females.

193
00:30:55,603 --> 00:31:00,108
As the rut intensified,
the fights became more brutal.

194
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:38,980
Today, however,
most of the prairie is silent.

195
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,363
Humans slaughtered the great herds.

196
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,454
Less than 30,000 wild bison remain,

197
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,085
and 90 percent of the prairie
has been lost,

198
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,298
most of it to agriculture.

199
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,784
What we eat, and how we produce it,

200
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,538
will determine the future
of our planet's grasslands.

201
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:49,550
Our past could show us
how we can feed ourselves

202
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,886
and still leave room for nature.

203
00:32:55,848 --> 00:33:01,396
The ancient hay meadows of Hungary,
still farmed in the traditional way,

204
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,316
provide habitats
of extraordinary richness.

205
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,372
Butterflies are abundant.

206
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,797
One species has
an almost unbelievably complex life cycle.

207
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,845
The Alcon blue.

208
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:41,978
Each female must mate and lay eggs
on just one species of plant,

209
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,563
the marsh gentian.

210
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,072
The eggs soon hatch into caterpillars.

211
00:33:55,825 --> 00:34:00,246
High up on the plants,
they're safe from predators below.

212
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,676
But then, the caterpillars
do something seemingly suicidal.

213
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:23,478
They abseil down on threads of silk
to the ground below...

214
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,231
and into danger.

215
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:38,283
They have no defense
against the marauding ants,

216
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,577
which carry them off.

217
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,419
But this is exactly what the caterpillars
need to happen.

218
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:55,676
They're producing a scent
like that emitted by an ant larva.

219
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,768
The ants respond
by taking them back to their nest.

220
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,862
There, they deposit them
in the colony's brood chamber.

221
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,869
The purple-colored caterpillars,
lying among the ants' own white larvae,

222
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,206
give off just the right signals.

223
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,380
And the nurse ants rush to feed them.

224
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,300
But there is more.

225
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,141
The caterpillars now start to mimic
the sounds made by the queen ant,

226
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,188
and, as a result,
the ants treat them like royalty.

227
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,944
If food gets short,

228
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,990
the ants will even feed the caterpillars
instead of their own young.

229
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:06,622
They give them such quantities of food
that the caterpillars grow hugely.

230
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,886
And there, underground, the caterpillars
feed and grow for nearly two years.

231
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:27,351
Until, one day,
there is nothing for the ants to feed.

232
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,231
The caterpillars have pupated.

233
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,408
But a few weeks later,

234
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,913
out crawls an Alcon blue butterfly.

235
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,185
Now, they begin to leave the nest

236
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:13,522
that has been their home
for the last 23 months.

237
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,793
The young adult
makes its way out of the nest

238
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,795
and clambers up a grass stem.

239
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:41,509
Its wings expand
as it prepares to fly off and find a mate.

240
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,476
This complex life
may be laborsaving for the butterfly,

241
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,353
but it's risky.

242
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,858
If anything happened to the ants
or to the gentian,

243
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,362
the Alcon blue would become extinct.

244
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,797
Only tiny fragments
of these ancient meadows

245
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,173
are left in Europe.

246
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,679
But beyond them to the east,

247
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:33,269
once stretched grasslands that extended
for a fifth of the way around the world,

248
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,896
from Romania to China.

249
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:03,215
Here, there are places where,
for mile after endless mile,

250
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,344
there are no roads or fences.

251
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,437
Here, where there are no trees,
eagles nest on the ground.

252
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:30,326
Once, these eagles would have preyed
on antelope that numbered in millions.

253
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,583
And some are still here.

254
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:43,756
These are saiga, antelope that live
nowhere else in the world.

255
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,261
Their extraordinary noses
are specially adapted

256
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,265
to filter out the dust kicked up
by the immense herds

257
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,600
that once lived here.

258
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,815
Now, they're critically endangered.

259
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:06,112
Poaching and the loss of habitat
have had a devastating impact on them.

260
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,494
But conservation efforts have recently
started to make a difference.

261
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:20,668
There is still hope
for these extraordinary plains dwellers.

262
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:33,180
And the proof of this
can be found further east, in Mongolia,

263
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,476
where the grasslands
still remain largely intact.

264
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,693
These are Przewalski’s horses.

265
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,197
Fifty years ago,
they were extinct in the wild,

266
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,076
but a few adults survived in captivity.

267
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,669
Careful breeding from 12 of them
increased their numbers

268
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,964
until there were sufficient
to release on the plains.

269
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,886
These are their descendants.

270
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,940
A stallion protects each harem.

271
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:34,283
They must be vigilant,
and they race to defend their herd...

272
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,629
or chase off bachelors
trying to lure away a mare.

273
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,687
With their numbers now topping 300,

274
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,651
the future for these wild horses
looks more secure.

275
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,990
Their recovery was only possible

276
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:20,663
because the vast Mongolian steppe
still remains largely untouched.

277
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:39,306
These grasses are some of the tallest
to be found anywhere on our planet.

278
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:47,314
They're so tall
they can conceal elephants.

279
00:42:56,365 --> 00:43:00,286
They make the giants that live among them
seem small.

280
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,223
A last hiding place

281
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:25,686
for the highly endangered
greater one-horned rhino.

282
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,990
This is India,

00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,286
one of the most populous countries
on Earth.

284
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:51,420
Yet here there is a great determination
to protect these crucial grasslands.

285
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,145
What must it be like

286
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:12,191
to live in this dense,
claustrophobic world?

287
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,996
Just moving about
could mean walking into danger.

288
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,308
The grasses conceal tigers.

289
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,572
Stripes and shadows blend.

290
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,924
Long grass
may hide a tigress from her prey,

291
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,809
but it also hides the prey from her.

292
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,446
She must get within 20 meters of it.

293
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:51,540
And she must always know
exactly where the prey are hidden.

294
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,593
She may have lost them.

295
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,117
She risks a look.

Every deer around

In the last hundred years,

304
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:47,799
the number of wild tigers
has declined by over 95 percent.

305
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,971
But here in India,

306
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,433
despite the enormous pressure
from poaching,

307
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,561
and a growing human population,

308
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,066
tiger numbers are actually increasing.

309
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:18,580
Protect the precious space
that grasslands and deserts provide,
