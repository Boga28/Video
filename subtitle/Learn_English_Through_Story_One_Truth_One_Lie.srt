1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,260
In this English lesson,
I'm going to tell you a lie.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,250
I'm going to tell you two stories.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,109
One of the stories that I tell you,

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,060
one of the stories will be true,

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,140
and the other story will be a lie.

6
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,850
But I'm not going to tell
you which one is which.

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,660
You will need to guess.

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,440
So listen to both stories and
maybe in the comments below,

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,940
let me know which story you think is true,

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,856
and which story you think is a lie.

11
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:28,420
And then tomorrow, I will
publish another video,

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,620
just a short video, where I
tell you which story was true,

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,040
and which story was a lie.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,125
Let's get started.

15
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:37,625
(upbeat music continues)

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,740
Story number one, "The Pet Puppy."

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,840
One day when I was about 10 years old,

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,150
my parents told me that
we would be getting

19
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,630
a new puppy soon.

20
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,730
Our dog Prince, was getting old

21
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,310
and they thought it would
be good to get a new dog

22
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,920
while Prince was still around,

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,100
so that the new puppy could
learn how to behave from him.

24
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,080
My sister begged them to get a poodle,

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,120
but my parents said that
wouldn't be a good breed of dog

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,200
for a farm.

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,370
And that we'd be getting
a dog from the neighbors,

28
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,230
because it was free and both its parents

29
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,230
were good farm dogs.

30
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:13,260
My sister and I were really excited.

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,610
And we got a special
place ready in the barn

32
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,080
for the new puppy.

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,370
We put some straw in a big cardboard box

34
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,600
and got a couple old
bowls from the kitchen

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,240
for water and food.

36
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,010
We even got to go to the
pet store with our mom,

37
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,440
to buy a bag of puppy chow.

38
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,320
A couple of days later,

39
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,580
we went to the neighbor's
farm to pick out our puppy.

40
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,520
Their dog had, had a litter of seven pups

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,670
and we would have first choice.

42
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,240
We were excited.

43
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,490
The puppies were about 10 weeks
old and they were so cute.

44
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,120
They were play fighting with each other

45
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,400
and yipping and barking.

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,820
Some were black and white,

47
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,330
some were brown and white,

48
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,570
and one was completely black.

49
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,950
My sister wanted the smallest one,

50
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,700
a small brown and white puppy
who was sitting in the corner,

51
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,120
far from the rest of the litter.

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,090
He looked scared and lonely.

53
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,250
I wanted the black puppy,

54
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,380
who was the biggest and most aggressive,

55
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,830
just fighting with all of
its brothers and sisters.

56
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,940
For some reason, my mom and
dad agreed with my sister

57
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,230
and a few moments later,

58
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,120
we were riding home in the car

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,790
with the small brown and
white scared little puppy,

60
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,463
sitting on my sister's lap.

61
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,870
When we got home, we
put the dog in the box

62
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,610
and my sister played with
it for the next few hours.

63
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,160
She loved the dog from
the moment she saw it.

64
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,860
And it was clear that the
dog liked her a lot too.

65
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,000
At the dinner table that night,

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,610
we talked about names for the dog.

67
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,860
I suggested Brutus, as I
thought it sounded like a cool,

68
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,070
tough name.

69
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,990
My sister liked the name King,

70
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,240
because our older dog was named Prince.

71
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,000
My parents said that we could decide.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,080
I liked her idea.

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,760
And so we named the dog King.

74
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,140
King grew quickly and soon
learned to do all the same things

75
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,210
that Prince did.

76
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,720
He helped to bring in the cows at night.

77
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,130
He barked when strangers came to the farm.

78
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,340
He chased cats a lot.

79
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,740
Although, that wasn't
really one of his jobs,

80
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,000
but he sure seemed to like it.

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,560
King lived a long and
happy life on the farm.

82
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,990
And it became clear over the years,

83
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,380
that King was my sister's dog.

84
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,250
As you probably know, dogs
usually only have one real owner,

85
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,000
even if they live with a
whole family of humans.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,500
And he seemed to have chosen my sister.

87
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,690
I was good with that.

88
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,624
I'm not really a dog person anyways.

89
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:25,124
(upbeat music continues)

90
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,260
Story number two, "The Pet Spider."

91
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,250
Once when I was a kid, I
found a spider in my bedroom.

92
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,460
It was a small brown spider,
and I thought it was cute.

93
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,610
It had spun a web up in
the corner of the ceiling

94
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,480
and was sitting in the middle of it.

95
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,660
I got a small jar with a lid from my mom

96
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,680
and I used the lid to flick
the spider off its web

97
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,490
into the jar and then
quickly screwed on the lid.

98
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:50,870
When my dad came in for lunch,

99
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,380
I showed him the spider
in the jar and he told me

100
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,420
I should find a bigger jar
and put some small holes

101
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,570
in the lid so the spider
would have fresh air.

102
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,240
My mom told me that I should
catch flies in the kitchen

103
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,660
and put them in the jar
for the spider to eat.

104
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,710
I'm not sure if she was excited
that I had a pet spider,

105
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,070
but she was certainly excited

106
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,063
that I would be ridding the
kitchen of flies each day.

107
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,120
I rummaged around in the
cupboard below the sink

108
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,399
and found a large glass jar with a lid.

109
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,479
I went outside and found some stones,

110
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,800
some small sticks and
some blades of grass,

111
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,250
and put them in the jar.

112
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,060
I wanted the jar to be nice
and cozy for my spider,

113
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,400
so it would be happy.

114
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,990
And I thought it would like
the stones, sticks and grass.

115
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,970
I asked to borrow my
dad's hammer and a nail

116
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,940
and punched some holes in the lid.

117
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,530
I also filled an old bottle cap with water

118
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,230
and slowly lowered it to
the bottom of the jar,

119
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,380
without spilling any of the water.

120
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,370
I then carefully transferred
the spider from the smaller jar

121
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,683
to the bigger jar and screwed the lid on.

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,040
I wasn't sure where to
put the jar in my room.

123
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,610
I didn't know if spiders
liked light or dark,

124
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,440
but seeing the web up in the dark corner,

125
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,600
I assumed they liked the dark.

126
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,470
So I put the jar on my
bookshelf, far from the window.

127
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,020
I named my spider Rick.

128
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,550
And every day I would check
to see if he had spun a web.

129
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,650
I would catch flies and put
them in the jar for Rick to eat.

130
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,860
Unfortunately, Rick
never made a spiderweb,

131
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,630
so he never caught and
ate any of the flies.

132
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,440
When I watched him, he
would just sit in one spot.

133
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,860
I would never see him move.

134
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,260
But he was always in a
different place when I looked,

135
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,033
so I knew he was still alive.

136
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,610
A couple of days after catching Rick,

137
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,060
I went to the library and
borrowed a book about spiders.

138
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,800
In the book it said that
spiders didn't make great pets.

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,470
And that the best thing for
them is to be in the wild.

140
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,970
I was sad, but I knew
I had to let Rick go.

141
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,090
I carefully took the lid off
the jar and set it on the floor

142
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,720
in the corner of my room.

143
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,010
A few flies flew out,

144
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,320
but Rick just sat on his favorite stick.

145
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,730
I decided to let him be.

146
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,750
After all, he usually only moved

147
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,800
when no one was watching him.

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,270
The next day, Rick was gone.

149
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,660
He never came back.

150
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,970
I thought maybe he would
return in a day or two

151
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,620
to his web in the
ceiling, but he never did.

152
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,470
And although I was sad that he was gone,

153
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,610
I was also happy because he was free.

154
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,240
Well, do you think you know the answer?

155
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,450
Do you know which story was a
lie and which story was true?

156
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,630
Please let me know in the comments below.

157
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,020
And remember, in about 24
hours, in about a day or so,

158
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,370
I'll put out another video,

159
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,110
where I tell you which story was true

160
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,720
and which one was a lie.

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,900
I hope you enjoyed learning
English through story,

162
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:25,733

167
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,430
just a little bit more English.

168
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,080
And if you wanna learn a bit more

169
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,200
about secrets, lies and the truth,

170
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,606
I do have a couple more
lessons you could watch.

171
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:42,773
