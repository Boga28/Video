1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,670
"Shall I compare thee to a
summer's day? Thou art more

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,280
lovely and more temperate."

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,160
So, you may have heard that
before somewhere; it may sound

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,890
rather familiar. So, you may
know that it's by Shakespeare,

5
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:31,070
the English poet and playwright.
So, today, we have a lesson on

6
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,960
some slightly old-fashioned
English language, but I've had a

7
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,210
few requests to cover this
topic, so I'm responding to

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:47,630
those requests. And this is for
native English speakers, as well

9
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,480
as for people who are learning
English, people who usually

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,480
watch my channel to learn
English or improve their

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,920
English. But I think native
speakers of English will also

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,380
find this useful if you're
interested in, for example,

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,740
poetry and older styles of
English language and literature.

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:22,310
So.  So, today's lesson, then,
is about what I call the archaic

15
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:31,340
second-person singular form,
which is: "thee", "thou", "thy",

16
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:39,080
and "thine", and "thyself" is
another form of it. So, these

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:47,090
words tend to appear in poetry.
Okay. So, I'm just going to show

18
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,170
you some text here.

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:57,330
Okay, so here we have the words,
we've got: "thou", "thee",

20
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:05,040
"thy", "thine", and "thyself.
And you can see that the modern

21
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,440
equivalent is just: "you",
"you", "your", "your" or

22
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:17,640
"yours", and "yourself". So, it
depends whether it's the subject

23
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,560
of the sentence, or the object,
or the possessive, or the

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,070
reflexive. So, I'll explain that
as we go along.

25
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,520
So, with "thou", like in the
quotation I began with: "Thou

26
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,710
art more lovely and more
temperate", it means: "You are

27
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,200
more lovely." So, "you", "thou"
- they are the subject of that

28
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,240
statement. "You are", "thou
art". Okay.

29
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,010
So, also to say that these
words, oh, a few 100 years ago,

30
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,090
at the time of Shakespeare and
before a bit before Shakespeare

31
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,810
as well, and after Shakespeare,
writers and speakers, also

32
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,540
people were using these words in
conversation, too. It was just

33
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,560
the usual form. I'll explain a
bit more about that on.  In the

34
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,740
next section. So, that's "thou"
is the subject. Thou art more

35
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,900
lovely. You are more lovely."

36
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,550
And then when it's the object,
it changes to "thee", so: "Shall

37
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,890
I compare thee to a summer's
day?" means: "Shall I compare

38
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:43,980
you to a summer's day?" So,
that's the object. Okay.

39
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,820
And then "thy" is the
possessive; so that means your,

40
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,770
what belongs to you. Okay. You
could say: "Thy.  Thy face, thy

41
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,450
beautiful face", something like
that. "Your face, your beautiful

42
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,000
face", that kind of thing. Okay.

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,100
And then "thine" is an
alternative. It depends

44
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,660
sometimes. If the next word
begins with a vowel: "Thine

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,210
eyes", for example, you wouldn't
say: "Thy eyes". "Thy eyes", it

46
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,020
sounds a bit ugly because
there's a break between "thy

47
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,770
eyes". So: "Thine eyes", it sort
of flows better. "Thine eyes are

48
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:38,350
shining" or whatever; meaning:
"Your eyes". So, that's the

49
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,240
possessive; belonging to you.

50
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,380
And then the reflexive:
"thyself" meaning "yourself".

51
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,910
You could say.  If you look in
a mirror, you see yourself, so

52
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,480
in this older form, you might
say: "Thou seest thyself in the

53
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,020
mirror", something like that.
"You see yourself in the

54
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,750
mirror." Okay. So, that's the
general overview of these words.

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,420
So, if we just carry on, just to
explain a little bit more about

56
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,300
them. So, these are all the
second-person singular, archaic

57
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:31,080
form; the old-fashioned style of
English from around the time of

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:37,980
Shakespeare, as I said. And it's
often found in poetry and also

59
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,350
in Shakespeare's plays, and
older writings in general; old

60
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,740
editions of the Bible, for
example. And it's the old sort

61
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:52,290
of informal, familiar form.

62
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:57,600
Whereas when in the past when
people said: "You" that was sort

63
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,010
of more formal and respectful,
which is still the case in a lot

64
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,290
of other languages all over the
world, but I'm just using here

65
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:15,150
examples from French and German.
In French, "tu" is the familiar

66
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:22,260
form of "you". And "du" in
German is the familiar form of

67
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:22,740
"you".

68
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,510
So, this familiar form, although
it's not used in English

69
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:33,450
anymore, or only in poetry or
for particular purposes, it's

70
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,560
still used in a lot of other
languages; French and German,

71
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:44,370
for example. And it's to do with
how well you know somebody. If

72
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,630
you want to be.  You know. If
it's a friend or a family

73
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,730
member, you might use "tu" or
"du". If it's somebody you want

74
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,540
to show more respect and you
don't know them so well, you're

75
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:04,230
being more formal, you would use
a different form in that

76
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,280
language. So, there we are.

77
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:16,310
So, just to move on from there.
Here we are with some quotations

78
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,880
so that you can see how these
words are used in particular

79
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:30,920
quotations. So, here we have:
"Thou art as wise as thou art

80
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,880
beautiful." This is from
Shakespeare. If you want to find

81
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,460
out where exactly it's from,
rather than me telling you, I

82
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:47,000
think you might find it quite a
nice bit of research you can do.

83
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,800
If you just Google this
quotation, I'm sure you will

84
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,380
find where it comes from. And it
might be quite fun to do that

85
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,770
for you, rather than me just
tell you where it comes from.

86
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,630
You know it's from Shakespeare,
but where? Is it from a play? Is

87
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,160
it from a poem? Well, I think
Google will help you to find

88
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,680
out. So: "Thou art".

89
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,610
You can see also the verb. We. 
In modern English, we would say:

90
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:25,560
"You are as wise as you are
beautiful", but the verb also

91
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:31,980
usually changes that goes with
"thou" and I'll explain a little

92
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:38,520
bit more about that later on in
the video. Okay.

93
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:43,080
And then here's another
Shakespeare quotation: "I pray

94
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,590
thee, gentle mortal, sing
again." So: "I pray you, or I

95
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,170
beg you, I ask you: Please sing
again. Because I like your

96
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:01,350
singing, so please; I pray you.
I pray thee, sing again. That

97
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,910
sounded nice, so please sing
again." So.  Okay.

98
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,620
And then this: This sounds very
similar to what I was quoting at

99
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,550
the beginning; I wonder if it
comes from the same poem,

100
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:22,760
perhaps. Summer is mentioned
again. "Shall I compare thee to

101
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,330
a summers day?" So, this line
says: "But thy, eternal summer,

102
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,980
shall not fade." So, this is the
possessive now, but: "Your

103
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:39,950
eternal summer shall not fade."
Okay? So: "Thy eternal summer."

104
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,630
I just wonder why it's not:
"Thine eternal summer", because

105
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,620
it doesn't fit the rule I've
mentioned earlier, but then

106
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:56,690
Shakespeare did what he felt
like, so it sounds okay to me.

107
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,130
"Thy eternal summer."

108
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,580
Okay. And then we have another
poet here, John Donne. And in

109
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,660
something he wrote, which again,
you can find if you Google it:

110
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:18,270
"My face in thine eye; thine in
mine appears." So, this does

111
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:24,240
follow that rule. He's saying:
"Thine eye", not "Thy eye". "Thy

112
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,900
eye" sounds a bit odd. So, what
he's saying is: "These two

113
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,100
people who are looking at each
other, they can see their own

114
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,920
reflection in the other person's
eye, like in a mirror." So, he

115
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,250
says: "My face in thine eye, and
your.  Your.  My face in your

116
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,970
eye, and your face in my eye. We
can see each other in. 

117
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,860
Reflected in each other's eyes,
like in a mirror." That's what

118
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,770
he's saying, in that poem. "My
face in thine eye; thine in mine

119
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,320
appears." Okay.

120
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,990
Then we have a Greek
philosopher, Plato. So, this is

121
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:23,100
obviously a quote, a translation
into English. So: "Do thine own

122
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:31,050
work and know thyself." So: "Do
your own work and know

123
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,050
yourself." So, I suppose that
means just: "Do. Do your own

124
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,690
thing, and understand yourself
through what you do. It's part

125
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:49,020
of your identity." So, again,
we've got that rule: "thine own

126
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,000
work", not "thy own work".
Whoever translated it chose to

127
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,320
use that form: "thine own".
Okay?

128
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,880
Then we have some Shakespeare
again: "Hamlet". Well, that

129
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,640
gives you a big clue as where it
comes from, if you've heard of a

130
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:15,630
play called Hamlet. So: "Hamlet,
thou hast thy father much

131
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:23,550
offended. Hamlet, you have your
father much offended." Meaning:

132
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:31,410
"Hamlet, you have offended your
father very much." The word

133
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:39,210
order is a bit strange, because
it's poetic. But "thou hast" you

134
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:46,200
can see again. "Hast" - the verb
ending changes. It's not "have",

135
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,560
"you have", "thou hast". So, as
I say, we'll.  I'll explain

136
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,070
that later on. Okay, so Hamlet
has offended his father. Or

137
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,380
rather, I think, not his real
father, but his stepfather or

138
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:13,680
his uncle. He's both, really,
for various complicated reasons,

139
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,170
which I won't go into.

140
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,810
So, here's our quotation that we
started with: "Shall I compare

141
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:28,080
thee to a summer's day? Thou art
more lovely and more temperate."

142
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,500
So, "thee" and "you are", "thou
art." We've got the different

143
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,240
verb ending again.

144
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,030
Okay, and then we have Shelley
who was quite a bit later than

145
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:49,010
Shakespeare, sort of early 19th
century, but then poets did tend

146
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:54,950
to keep using "thee" and "thou"
a lot more because it kind of

147
00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:00,260
goes with the poetic style. So,
in poetry, you might find it a

148
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,420
lot, you know, coming more up to
date in time, because it's a

149
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,700
poetic tradition in a way. So,
let's see what we have here.

150
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:17,750
Now, this is Shelley writing or
speaking to a bird, a skylark.

151
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:26,690
So, it's a bird high up in the
sky, singing, making an amazing

152
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:34,790
sound, and he's writing a poem
to the bird. So, he says: "Hail

153
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:41,570
to thee, blithe spirit." So:
"Hail to you." Or, you know:

154
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:47,600
"Hello." He's saying: "Hello,
hello. Hello, you up there. Hail

155
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,790
to thee, blithe spirit".
"Blithe" means "happy". Happy

156
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,440
spirit, because the bird is
flying around, singing, sounding

157
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,030
very happy.

158
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:08,080
"Bird, thou never wert. Bird,
you never were." So, here we've

159
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:12,790
got the past tense of the ver
 "to be", which is usually "wa

160
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:12,880
" or "were". But here, with "th
u", it changes again. "Thou wer

161
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,180
"Bird thou never wert, That from
Heaven, or near it, Pourest thy

162
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,030
" or "Thou never wert". So, the
e's another verb ending that cha

163
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:25,240
full heart." So, he's saying
 "This bird is pouring its hear

164
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,760
ges. Okay? So, he's saying: "Yo
 were never really a bird." He 

165
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,130
hinks this bird is so spe
ial; it's very different fro

166
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:36,850
 other birds. 

167
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:58,480
 out." So: "Pourest thy ful
 heart - you pour your ful

168
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,450
 heart." So, you can see, again
 "to pour" is to pour ou

169
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:09,940
 something from your heart or t
 pour.  In a literal sense, "t

170
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,500
 pour a liquid" like pouring 
 cup of tea from a tea pot, tha

171
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:21,130
 sort of thing, or pouring wate
 from a jug. So: "pour" an

172
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:30,760
 "pourest". "Thou pourest th
 heart, thy full heart in profus

173
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:38,170
 strains of unpremeditated art.
 So, meaning the sounds, th

174
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:45,310
 strains, the music from th
 bird. "Unpremeditated" meanin

175
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,050
 sort of unplanned; it's jus
 spontaneous. The bird is jus

176
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,030
 singing spontaneously an
 pouring out its heart in a ver

177
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:02,590
 happy mood, apparently. Okay, s
 we have several examples, we'v

178
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:09,910
 got "thee", and "thou", an
 "thy". So, that's a good exampl

179
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,310
 using three of the forms

180
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,929
Okay, so now just to explain a
little bit about the verb

181
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:23,849
endings, and I've just given a
few different verbs here to show

182
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:31,260
how the form works. So, the verb
"to know": "I know, you know, he

183
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:37,860
knows, she knows". For "thou",
it's "thou knowest" or "thou

184
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:44,040
know'st". Offered you get this
apostrophe to show there's a

185
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,750
missing letter: "know'st". And,
in poetry, that's quite

186
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:54,540
important because the rhythm of
the poetry matters; the number

187
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,250
of syllables in a line. And
sometimes the poet just wants

188
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,950
one syllable, rather than two,
so they can choose between "thou

189
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:12,000
knowest" and "thou know'st". So,
two syllables with "knowest" and

190
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,470
one syllable with "know'st". And
that choice is often made

191
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:24,870
because of the rhythm or the
meter of the line to make sure

192
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,440
it's not one beat too much or
one beat too few. Okay.

193
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,750
So, then the verb "to go":
"They'll goest". So, often, it's

194
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,660
an "s-t", that goes on the end
of the verb. So, then: "to

195
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:49,120
make": "thou makest". Or "thou
mak'st" if you just want one

196
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,300
syllable, "mak'st", like that.
And then the verb "to be": "thou

197
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:01,840
art" because it's an irregular
verb. "I am, you are, he is, she

198
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:09,490
is," but "thou art". So.  Or it
could be: "Thou beest, thou

199
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,380
beest". It's not.  It's not
meaning: "You're a beast." It's

200
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:20,470
not the same spelling, anyway.
"Thou beest, thou beest, beest".

201
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,610
And then the past tense, also:
"I was, you were, he was, she

202
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:35,380
was, thou wast" in the past. Or
another alternative: "Thou

203
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:41,380
wert", which is closer to
"were". "You were, thou wert".

204
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:51,760
And "thou wast" is closer to "I
was, I was, thou wast". So, it's

205
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,160
closer to that. Okay?

206
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,900
And then "to have": "thou hast".
"Thou".  And then the past:

207
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:06,250
"Thou hadst". A bit difficult to
pronounce. So, "had". "I had in

208
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:14,080
the past. You had, we had, they
had, thou hadst", so the "s-t"

209
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,030
does come up a lot. Okay.

210
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:27,300
"To do": "I do, you do. He does.
She does. Thou dost" or "Thou

211
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:33,840
doest. Doest". And then in the
past: "I did, you did, he did."

212
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:40,110
It's all "did", but: "Thou
didst, didst". Okay.

213
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,640
And then "can": "Thou canst".
"Could": "Thou couldst". "May":

214
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,070
"Thou mayest" or "Thou mayst" if
you want just one syllable

215
00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:00,700
instead of two. "Should": "Thou
shouldst". "Would": "Thou

216
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:09,640
wouldst". "Shall": "Thou shalt".
Okay. And "will": "Thou wilt".

217
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:15,880
And "must": "Thou must". And
there, there's no change at all.

218
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,160
No change to the verb. Okay?
There's always one exception at

219
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,370
least. Right. So, I hope that's
all clear.

220
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:33,870
And then we have a bit of
information about how this form

221
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,160
is still used even in a very
modern way. In films, for

222
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:45,360
example. So, in Star Wars in The
Empire Strikes Back, Darth Vader

223
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,840
says: "What is thy bidding, my
master?" So: "What is your

224
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,970
bidding?" Meaning: "What do you
want me to do? What are my

225
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,220
orders for today?" That sort of
thing. "What is thy bidding, my

226
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,780
master? What? What must I do?
What do you want me to do?"

227
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:11,070
Okay? So, if you're a Star Wars
fan, that's probably a very

228
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,470
familiar line.

229
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:19,960
And then also in some regional
dialects in the UK, Lancashire,

230
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:25,240
and Yorkshire, up in the north,
and also in the west, more

231
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:32,560
further south. But in the west
these are used still. So, some

232
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:37,270
people might say: "Sit thee
down", meaning: "Sit yourself

233
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:41,500
down. Sit. " Or: "Sit you
down." I've heard people say:

234
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:48,790
"Sit you down, sit you down, sit
thee down. I'll get thee a cup

235
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,940
of tea", something like that.
"Sit thee down."

236
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:58,590
And then people also say: "Thou
knows, thou knows", which is. 

237
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,280
Means: "You know", or "Thou
knowest" as we had earlier with

238
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,420
the verb ending: "Thou knowest".
Some people, mostly in the

239
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,740
north, I think: "Thou knows,
thou knows". Or they might

240
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,670
pronounce it: "Thou knows, thou
knows" because they have some

241
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:19,140
different vowel sounds.

242
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,840
So, I hope that's been a useful
explanation, whether you're a

243
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,160
native English speaker, who's
perhaps never quite been sure of

244
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:36,010
homw these words work. Sometimes
you get people using them, but

245
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:39,190
they use the wrong form or they
don't put the right ending on

246
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,050
the verb because they're not
really clear on how it works

247
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,820
grammatically. So, I hope this
helps to see, if you're.  If

248
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,300
you're actually writing poetry
yourself, you might want to use

249
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,950
it in the correct way. Okay.

250
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:03,970
So, that's.  That's the. 
That's the lesson. And there is

251
00:24:04,082 --> 00:24:11,242
a quiz. If you'd like to do the
quiz just to test your knowledge

252
00:24:11,354 --> 00:24:18,626
on this, do go to www.engvid.com
for the quiz. And you might also

253
00:24:18,738 --> 00:24:25,339
like to look out for my several
videos I've already made on

254
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:32,276
poetry, sometimes looking at a
particular poem, and analyzing

255
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:39,660
it. So, do look out for my other
poetry videos. And so that's it,

256
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:46,484
really. So, I will see thee
again soon I hope and take care.

257
00:24:46,596 --> 00:24:52,750
And all the best with the quiz.
Bye for now, then. Bye.
