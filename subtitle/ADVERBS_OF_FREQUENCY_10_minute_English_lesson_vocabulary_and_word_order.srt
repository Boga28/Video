5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:52,800
Now, today is an easy lesson, okay, maybe this is 
for your more beginner learners of English. But  

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:01,520
even if you are intermediate or advanced, this is 
still a great catch-up lesson to remind you to use  

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:10,240
adverbs of frequency in the correct way. So today 
our video is about adverbs of frequency. Now,  

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:21,120
maybe this sounds a bit complicated, adverbs of 
frequency, but it is very, very easy. Okay today I  

9
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:30,240
am teaching you six key words so that you can talk 
about adverbs of frequency. So what does this mean  

10
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:40,080
adverbs of frequency? Well it means how often we 
do something, how many times do we do something.  

11
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,200
Okay so the first word we are 
going to learn is always. Always.  

12
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,880
Now this is the highest frequency that 
you can do something. For example,  

13
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:06,480
I always drink coffee in the morning. This means 
every single day. Every morning I drink my coffee.  

14
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:15,120
Always. Okay and be careful with the position 
of your adverb in your sentence. Listen to me.  

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,120
I always drink coffee. So the adverb goes between 
the subject and the verb. I always drink. Okay,  

16
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,960
but be careful when you use the verb 
to be. As I'm sure you already know  

17
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,640
the verb to be is a bit special, it doesn't 
follow all the rules like the other verbs  

18
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,000
so when you want to use the verb to be, 
your position of your adverb changes.  

19
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:58,960
For example I am always happy. I am always 
happy. So this time we have subject, verb,  

20
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:09,760
adverb. Okay we have switched the adverb and 
the verb around. Okay so I always drink. I  

21
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:18,080
am always happy. Okay so far so good? 
Let's learn the next verb of frequency.  

22
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:27,280
So the next level down is when you almost always 
do something but not always. And this word is  

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,120
usually. Usually. So this is almost 
always but not every single time.  

24
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:46,960
For example, I usually go to the gym. I usually 
go to the gym. This means I go to the gym  

25
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,040
almost every day, but maybe there are one 
or two days that I don't go to the gym.  

26
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:04,000
I usually go. And remember with the verb to 
be it changes, okay, I am usually on time. I  

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,400
am usually on time. Not always, maybe one or two 
times I am late, but usually I am on time, okay?  

28
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,240
Okay, next adverb of frequency, next level 
down, this is when you do something a lot  

29
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:26,560
but it's just not as much as always or 
usually, okay, and this word is often.  

30
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:38,160
Often. I often walk in the park. I often walk in 
the park. Okay, this means, I don't know, maybe  

31
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:46,480
three times a week, four times a week, sort 
of in the middle. I often go. Not always,  

32
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:56,000
not usually, but often, many times. And again 
remember with the verb to be. I am often tired.  

33
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,880
I am often tired. The next adverb of frequency is 
sometimes. Sometimes. So this is sometimes I do  

34
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:17,040
sometimes I don't, it's completely in the middle. 
Sometimes. For example, she sometimes studies. She  

35
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,840
sometimes studies. She doesn't always study, 
she doesn't even study most days, sometimes,  

36
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,680
maybe two or three times a week, sometimes, when 
she wants to, we don't know when. Sometimes, okay.  

37
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,640
And again with the verb to be, the same as 
all of them, she is sometimes lazy. Okay,  

38
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:50,400
she sometimes studies. She is sometimes lazy. 
Okay, be careful with the position of the adverb,  

39
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,640
okay. All right, next adverb 
of frequency is hardly ever.  

40
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,840
Hardly ever. So this is almost never, but maybe 
one time a month. One time a month. For example,  

41
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,200
I hardly ever go to the cinema. 
I hardly ever go to the cinema,  

42
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,840
maybe I go to the cinema once a month or once a 
year even, I hardly ever, once every now and then.  

43
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,880
And again with the verb to be the same as all of 
the others, it's super easy to follow the rule.  

44
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,840
I am hardly ever late. I am hardly ever late. 
Maybe one time I am late, but usually no,  

45
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:47,920
I am hardly ever late. Okay, it's super easy 
right? With every single adverb frequency  

46
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,160
it's the same pattern and the same rule for the 
verb to be. Okay, super easy, you still with me?  

47
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:04,320
We have one more adverb of frequency and it is 
the adverb never. Never. So this is the opposite  

48
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:15,520
of always. Always is every single time and never 
is no times. Never. For example, he never goes  

49
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:23,760
swimming. He never goes swimming. Not once 
a week, not once a month, not once a year.  

50
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:32,880
Never. He never goes swimming, not once. Okay and 
again with the verb to be, the same as all of the  

51
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:45,280
others. He is never sad. He is never sad. Not 
sometimes, not often, never. He is never sad,  

52
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,360
which is the same as saying the opposite. He 
is always happy, okay. He is always happy.  

53
00:07:53,920 --> 00:08:03,680
He is never sad. Okay so adverbs of frequency are 
super simple and easy to put into your sentences,  

54
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:10,560
but they lift up your english level, okay, to 
make it even more complex, complete and like  

55
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,160
a native English speaker. Okay so now it's your 
turn. In the comments below you have to put some  

56
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,720

tell me what do you always do? What do you  

57
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,120
sometimes? Do what do you never do? Okay, make
