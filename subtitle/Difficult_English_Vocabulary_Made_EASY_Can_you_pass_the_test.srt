Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.  

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:15,920
Hmm, do you know these tricky words? Can you use 
them correctly in English? Let's talk about it. 

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,080
Have you ever experienced this before? 
You're having an English conversation  

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,280
and then all of a sudden bleh, bleh, bleh, you 
don't have the word that you're searching for.  

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,960
It's somewhere in there, but it's covered with 
dust and you just can't search for it and reach  

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,640
for it at the right time. Well, never fear, 
today, in this lesson, I'm going to help you  

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,280
master some tricky words in English and 
hopefully make them easier for you to understand. 

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,920
To help you with this process, I have created a 
free PDF worksheet that you can download with the  

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,840
link in the description. In this PDF worksheet, 
you can find all of the sample sentences, all  

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,680
of the meanings, some little tips and tricks for 
how to use these words, and at the end of the PDF,  

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,000
you can answer Vanessa's Challenge Question so 
that you can use and remember what you've learned.  

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
For all of these tricky words, I'm going to be 
quizzing you. I'll give you a sentence and you  

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,280
need to choose which of the two words fits best 
in that sentence and, of course, as your teacher,  

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,000
I will be giving you some explanations to help 
you so that you can feel empowered to use them  

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,200
yourself. But be careful, one of these questions 
is a trick question. Are you ready? Let's start. 

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,680
I can't believe how ... your son is now. Last 
time I saw him, he was only four years old.  

17
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,160
I can't believe how high your son is. 
I can't believe how tall your son is.  

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,840
Which one of these simple words, but it's 
a little bit tricky which one is correct,  

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,720
which one of these words is right? And only one 
of them is correct. I'll give you three seconds to  

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:15,120
think. 3, 2, 1. I can't believe how tall your son 
is now. Hmm, if we said, "I can't believe how high  

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,360
your son is now," do you know what that means? It 
means that he is taking drugs. If someone is high,  

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,640
that means they're taking drugs. But if 
someone is tall, that means that they are,  

23
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,320
well, tall. Taller than someone who is short.
So here's a little tip and trick for how to  

24
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:43,600
use high versus tall. Usually we use high for 
something that's not touching the ground. So  

25
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,520
you could say the airplane is high. Or, sometimes 
we say the airplane is high up. It's not touching  

26
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,440
the ground. But you can say the building is tall 
because the building is touching the ground.  

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,800
Your son is tall because his feet are touching 
the ground. So we have this difference between  

28
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,520
high and tall, two seemingly simple words that 
can be tricky if you use them in the wrong way. 

29
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,240
All right, are you ready for the second 
one? Let's do it. Boy, have I had a ... day!  

30
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:28,080
Boy, have I had a mad day! Boy, have I had a crazy 
day! Hmm, which one of these words is best to use?  

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:40,800
2, 1. Boy, have I had a crazy day! Oh, when 
something is crazy, it feels out of control,  

32
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,000
so many things are happening. When something 
is mad, well, we usually use this for people.  

33
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm mad. I'm angry. But the thing that's 
tricky here, and a little tip for you,  

34
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,680
is that in Old English, the word mad was often 
substituted for the word crazy. So take a look  

35
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,240
at this movie poster. This is a famous movie 
and it's called It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  

36
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,040
They're not talking about being angry; they're 
talking about being crazy. This world is crazy.  

37
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:25,200
But nowadays we never use the word mad in this 
type of situation. We only use the word crazy.  

38
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:32,240
So if you're talking about something that's hectic 
and chaotic and it's out of control, it is crazy.  

39
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,920
It's not mad. You are mad, you're angry. But 
when something is out of control, it's crazy. 

40
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,320
Tricky word pair number three: His essay 
about courage was only one sentence,  

41
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,840
"This is courage," and the 
rest of the paper was ...  

42
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,240
Hmm, the rest of the paper was blank. 
The rest of the paper was empty. Hmm,  

43
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,960
which one of these two words is best to use. I'll 
give you three seconds to think about it. Hmm,  

44
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:17,600
the rest of the paper was blank. Usually, 
something that's flat is blank, so a piece  

45
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:27,440
of paper with nothing on it is blank. What 
about empty? Well, you can't really pour water  

46
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:36,320
into a piece of paper, we need a container. 
Well, if there is nothing in a container,  

47
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:45,280
it's empty. This is the idea here: something 
that's flat is blank and something that can be ...  

48
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,120
have something go inside of it, can be filled 
with something else, a container, is empty. 

49
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,360
There is one phrase that I'd like to share with 
you that kind of breaks this rule or we should say  

50
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,000
bends this rule a little bit, and that 
is when we say my mind is blank. Well,  

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,800
your brain is not really flat, but it's 
not really a typical container that can  

52
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,640
just have something poured into it, but 
we use this phrase, "My mind is blank,"  

53
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,600
to mean I can't think of the answer. I don't 
know what you're talking about. I have nothing  

54
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,880
going on here. My mind is blank. Sorry, I 
can't remember what to say. My mind is blank. 

55
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,480
Wonderful. All right, let's go to the next 
pair. I'm so excited about my ... car.  

56
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm so excited about my young car. I'm so excited 
about my new car. Which one of these is best?  

57
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:56,160
I'm so excited about my new car. Well, usually we 
use new for things and young for people. The child  

58
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,240
is young. The car is new. But a little 
tip, there is an exception to this,  

59
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,480
something that can use both new and young, 
and that is a country. So we might say,  

60
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,880
"Well, relative to other countries, the United 
States is a young country," or "The United  

61
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:27,920
States is a new country. It wasn't United under 
one leader until the last couple hundred years,  

62
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,400
but a lot of countries have been around for a 
long time." So we might say the United States  

63
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,560
is a new country or the United States is 
a relatively young country. For a country,  

64
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,960
we can use either of these words.
My cat learned a new trick. He's so ... Hmm,  

65
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,880
he's so smart; he's so wise. Which 
one of these is the best for my cat?  

66
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:06,080
3, 2, 1. My cat learned a new trick. He's 
so smart. The cat is smart, but the old man  

67
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:14,160
is wise. Usually, we use smart for some kind of 
innate knowledge, something that's inside of you,  

68
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,680
but it can also be learned knowledge. So what's 
the difference between smart and wise? Well, wise  

69
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:29,360
usually has to do with making good decisions. It's 
not about knowing the correct answer. It's about a  

70
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,040
deeper type of knowledge about the world 
and that comes from a lot of experience.  

71
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:44,880
You're not born being wise. Only people who have 
a lot of life experience can be wise. So in this  

72
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,000
situation, my cat learned a new trick. He's pretty 
smart, but he doesn't have life experience that he  

73
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,040
can share with other cats. He's not very wise, but 
you know what, sometimes he can be pretty smart. 

74
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:06,000
The movie star drove a ... car. 
The movie star drove a rich car  

75
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,760
or the movie star drove an expensive car. Which 
one of these two words about money is correct?  

76
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:22,160
I'll give you three seconds. 3, 2, 1. 
The movie star drove an expensive car.  

77
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:32,240
Rich is for people. The movie star is rich, 
but expensive is for things. The car is  

78
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,320
expensive. This is an excellent distinction. 
People are rich; things are expensive. 

79
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:47,120
The thief broke into the safe and stole 
something ... And stole something valuable?  

80
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:58,960
And stole something invaluable? Which one of these 
is correct? 3, 2, 1. The thief broke into the safe  

81
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:07,840
and stole something valuable. Or, the thief broke 
into the safe and stole something invaluable.  

82
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,760
Sorry, this was the trick question. Both 
of these words, valuable and invaluable,  

83
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:24,880
have a similar meaning. Now, the thing that's 
weird about this is that usually in-, the prefix  

84
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:33,520
in-, makes it a negative word. But what about 
this valuable, invaluable? They have very  

85
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,400
similar meanings and let me tell you about it.
The Royal jewels are valuable. This means that  

86
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:48,880
they're expensive. They have a big cost. They have 
a lot of value. The Royal jewels are valuable. But  

87
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:57,440
if we said the Royal jewels are invaluable, 
this implies that, yes, they're expensive,  

88
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,800
but they also have another layer of value. Maybe 
it's some kind of personal value. It's some kind  

89
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:12,240
of value that we can't even imagine. It's so 
important that we can't even put a number on it.  

90
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:20,240
We can't say that is $1,000 because there's a kind 
of deeper value. So if there is something that is  

91
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:27,200
passed down in your family, maybe it's something 
that's invaluable. Your great grandmother made  

92
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,840
a quilt and it's been passed down in your 
family. Well, that quilt is invaluable. No  

93
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,880
amount of money can put a price on how 
important that is to you. It's invaluable. 

94
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,760
So some things are both valuable and 
invaluable, like the Royal jewels,  

95
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:52,240
but maybe your great-grandmother's quilt 
isn't worth a lot of money, maybe it's not  

96
00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,000
valuable, but it is invaluable to you. It 
is more than important to you. What about  

97
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,120
learning English? Learning English is a valuable 
skill. Great, it's something that's important.  

98
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,400
But you can also say learning English is an 
invaluable skill. You cannot place a dollar  

99
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,600
value on learning English because the ways that 
English can change your life is without a price.  

100
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,960
There's so many wonderful things that can happen 
when you can speak confidently, understand other  

101
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:34,720
people, travel easily, have great work relations. 
This is invaluable. It's not just a dollar number,  

102
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:42,480
it's something in your heart as well. Great.
Do you ... the teacher's name? Do you remind  

103
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,680
the teacher's name? Do you remember the 
teacher's name? Hmm, remind, remember,  

104
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,080
I'll give you three seconds. 3, 2, 1. 
Do you remember the teacher's name?  

105
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,640
This is a common mistake I often hear English 
learners make. They say, "Can you remember me  

106
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:13,200
about the test tomorrow?" The biggest difference 
between remind and remember is who is doing it.  

107
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,120
Who is the subject? So let's take a look 
at these two sentences. You will remember  

108
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,880
the teacher's name. Who is remembering? It's 
you. You will remember the teacher's name. 

109
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,600
But take a look at this one: "I will 
remind you of the teacher's name."  

110
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,680
I'm the one who's speaking. I will remind you of 
the teacher's name. So it depends on who is the  

111
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:48,160
subject. Usually, students need to remember about 
a test, but if a student forgets about a test,  

112
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:56,240
the teacher will remind the students about a test. 
So make sure as an English learner that you do  

113
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:04,960
not say, "Can you remember me about the event?" 
No. If someone else is helping you, you can say,  

114
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:12,720
"Can you remind me about the event?" "Hey, would 
you mind sending me a text? Can you remind me  

115
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,040
about the event? That would be really helpful 
because I often forget about these types of  

116
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,760
things. It's difficult for me to remember, so can 
you remind me about the event, please? Excellent." 

117
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,560
My ... sister loves to ride horses. My little 
sister loves to ride horses or my small sister  

118
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:44,320
loves to ride horses. Which one of these is best? 
And there's only one answer here. 3, 2, 1. My  

119
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,640
little sister loves to ride horses. Maybe you 
learned a long time ago in elementary school,  

120
00:14:53,280 --> 00:15:00,000
I have a younger sister. I have an older 
sister and, yes, in daily conversation  

121
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,880
we use young and old, but we also use little and 
big as well. So you might say I have a big sister.  

122
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,560
I have a little sister. I have a big brother. I 
have a little brother. We also use little and big  

123
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,960
for people when they're related to us, especially 
for a sibling, a brother or a sister. For small,  

124
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:35,040
usually this is for an item. My sister's clothes 
are small. The shoes are too small. For the word  

125
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:45,680
small, when we're talking about an item, well, we 
often use both of these words. If I said that the  

126
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,760
butterfly is very small. The butterfly is very 
little. Look at the little butterfly. Look at this  

127
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:59,200
small butterfly. Both of these are fine. They're 
for non-human things. The shirt is too small. The  

128
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:05,200
shirt is too little. I can't wear it anymore. 
It's too little. It's too small for items,  

129
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:11,440
but for people, when we're talking about your 
relations, your brother or sister, we can use  

130
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:20,680
my little sister or my big sister. Excellent.
My computer is from 2005. It's so ...  

131
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:29,360
It's so antique or it's so old, which one of 
these words is the best in this sentence? Three,  

132
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:40,080
two, what? My computer is from 2005. It's so old. 
For an electronic, this is pretty old. Usually,  

133
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:47,920
we don't have electronics for 16 years. It's a 
little bit unusual so we could say it's so old.  

134
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:56,880
Now, technically, I think the real definition of 
the word antique is something that's 100 years old  

135
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:05,599
or older. But in colloquial daily conversation, 
sometimes we use this in a more flexible way. So  

136
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:15,519
you might say, "The record player is an antique" 
or "It's antique," and maybe it's from the 1940s.  

137
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,040
That's not technically 100 years, but it's 
something that's old. It's really old. At least,  

138
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:27,680
it seems really old and that's what we're talking 
about here is relatively, does it seem old?  

139
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,720
It doesn't have to be exactly 100 years old, 
but we could say that record player is an  

140
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,520
antique. It's been passed down from my 
grandparents and it's really cool. It still works.  

141
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,840
That is an antique, using it as a noun, 
or it's antique, using it as an adjective. 

142
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,480
I do want to let you know, as a little bonus 
tip, that sometimes we use the word antique as  

143
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:56,800
an exaggeration. So back to the original example 
of my computer from 2005, this is really old  

144
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:03,440
for a computer, right? I imagine most of you 
don't still have the same computer from 2005.  

145
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:11,200
So you could say, "Yeah, I still have my computer 
from 2005. It's practically an antique." So we  

146
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,120
can add that word practically, "It's pretty 
much an antique. I can't believe I still have  

147
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,120
it." So we're kind of softening the language a 
little bit because antique is really something  

148
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:31,360
pretty old, but for an electronic, 2005 is 
relatively old so we could say, "My computer is  

149
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,120
practically an antique. I can't believe it's 
still working. It's practically an antique." 

150
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:45,760
You're already finished eating? Did you even ... 
the salmon? What can we say here? Did you even  

151
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,760
taste the salmon? Did you even eat the salmon? 
Which one of these words is the best here?  

152
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:01,360
3, 2, 1. You're already finished 
eating? Did you even taste the salmon?  

153
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,480
Now, both of these words have to do with your 
tongue and food, but the difference here is that  

154
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:17,440
taste is for a small bite. "Did you even taste 
the salmon?" compared to "I ate the salmon."  

155
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,240
That means you pretty much finished the salmon. 
We often use this for children and say, "Just  

156
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:31,600
taste the food and give it a try." This means 
just a small bite and you can judge if it's  

157
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,640
something that you would like more of or you 
don't want any more of it. Just give it a taste.  

158
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Just have a little taste and 
see what you think about it. 

159
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,520
Your new haircut ... like it's 
comfortable for the hot summer weather.  

160
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,840
Your new haircut looks like it's comfortable. 
Your new haircut appears like it's comfortable.  

161
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,680
Which one of these is the best here. As you 
can tell, a lot of these words seem to have  

162
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,760
a similar meaning, but their nuances are important 
to know so that you use them correctly. I'll give  

163
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:12,560
you three seconds. 3, 2, 1. Your new haircut looks 
like it's comfortable for the hot summer weather.  

164
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,480
If you have a short haircut especially, 
this can be very comfortable for hot  

165
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,080
summer weather. Unlike my hair, my hair is always 
very hot so I almost always wear it up because  

166
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:30,400
it's not comfortable in the hot summer weather.
So what's the difference between look and appear?  

167
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,880
Let me take a look at these sentences with 
you. Your haircut looks like it's comfortable.  

168
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,680
Your haircut appears to be comfortable. When I 
say your haircut looks like it's comfortable,  

169
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,960
okay, that's just a statement. When I see your 
haircut, it looks comfortable. But when I say  

170
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,520
your haircut appears to be comfortable, 
we have an underlying nuance here.  

171
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:00,240
That means it appears, on the surface, it 
appears to be comfortable, but really it's not. 

172
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Let me give you a common situation where we 
use a appear. Everyone on Instagram appears  

173
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,920
to be having a great life. If you've ever 
looked at Instagram, you know that that's  

174
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:18,000
the way it seems. People choose the best pictures, 
happiest family, wonderful vacations, great food,  

175
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:26,240
but life isn't always like that. Life 
is real and not always perfect. That's  

176
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:33,200
not possible. So we can use this word, appear, 
to show the difference between the appearance  

177
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:40,080
and reality. Everyone on Instagram appears to be 
having a nice life. But I know that in reality,  

178
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,120
that's not the case. So if you ever follow a 
certain people on social media and it seems  

179
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,040
like their life is great and then all of a sudden, 
they say, "Actually we're getting a divorce," oh,  

180
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:57,600
it might be really shocking to you because they 
seem to be having a great life, they're appearing  

181
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,200
to have a great life, and then in reality, that's 
not the case. So we often use the word appear to  

182
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,920
show this difference between what something 
seems like or looks like and the reality. 

183
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,440
Great, all right, let's go to our next pair of 
tricky words. I try to ... my house at the end  

184
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:28,000
of the day. I try to clean my house or I try to 
wash my house. 3, 2, 1. I try to clean my house  

185
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,280
at the end of the day. The biggest difference 
between these two words is that clean is general  

186
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,400
and wash always involves water. So we could 
use both of these words to talk about a carpet.  

187
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,640
I tried to clean the carpet. Okay, maybe there's 
a spot and you're trying to get the spot out.  

188
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,160
Or, maybe you're taking some toys off of the 
carpet or you're trying to get a couple things  

189
00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:02,560
off of the carpet. But if we say I'm trying to 
wash the carpet, that means you are soaking it  

190
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:08,080
in water. Maybe you're using a washing machine. 
Maybe you're using some kind of a carpet  

191
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,920
cleaner device, but it always includes water.
I have a weird ... about this. I have a weird  

192
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:25,360
emotion about this or I have a weird feeling about 
this. Which one of these two words is best? 3, 2,  

193
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:33,040
1. I have a weird feeling about this. Do you ever 
say anything in your native language and you don't  

194
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:39,600
know exactly why you say that, but you know it's 
right? This is how I feel about these two words,  

195
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:46,800
emotion and feeling. Now, psychologists generally 
break these two words into saying that emotions  

196
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:54,320
are physical and feelings are mental, but it was a 
little bit confusing to me to try to read articles  

197
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,560
and break it down and explain it to you. So, 
instead, we're going to take a look at some fixed  

198
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,880
phrases that use emotion or feel and feeling 
so that you can use them correctly yourself. 

199
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:13,280
I felt a lack of emotion when I was fired from my 
job. I just didn't care. I felt a lack of emotion.  

200
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,920
So here, emotion might be sadness, anger. 
These are emotions. I felt a lack of emotion  

201
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:24,480
when I was fired from my job, I just didn't 
care. Why did he feel a lack of emotion?  

202
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,280
It seems like something you should feel emotional 
about. Take a look at this sentence: But later I  

203
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:38,080
had some strong feelings about being fired. So 
maybe in the moment you had a lack of emotion,  

204
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,120
but later you had some strong feelings 
about it. It's something that you can't  

205
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,480
really stop. It just comes from inside of 
you. So at our original sentence when I said  

206
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,880
I have a weird feeling about this, there's 
something inside of me. It wasn't conscious;  

207
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,080
it's just a weird feeling. As I walked down that 
dark street, I had a weird feeling about this,  

208
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:09,600
kind of my intuition. Or, in our second example, 
we'd say, I had some strong feelings about being  

209
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,760
fired later on. So something that came 
from within me, some strong feelings. 

210
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,800
I'd like to give you a phrase that you can use 
either emotions or feelings with. You could say,  

211
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:29,280
"I have mixed emotions about moving to a new 
city" or "I have mixed feelings about moving  

212
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,200
to a new city." In this phrase, to have 
mixed feelings or to have mixed emotions,  

213
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:41,280
you can use either of these words. This means 
sometimes I feel really excited about it, but  

214
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,560
I'm going to miss my family and, oh, I can't wait 
for new adventures, but, oh, I'm not sure if I'll  

215
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:53,040
succeed. You have mixed emotions or mixed feelings 
about moving to a new city. So as you can see,  

216
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,520
there are some exceptions to this as well.
So how did you do? Some of these words appear  

217
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,080
to be easy, but, remember, the more you practice, 
the better it will be. So don't forget to download
