1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,840
I've never jumped out of a plane before,

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,260
but here goes nothing.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,090
That's actually an English
phrase that we use sometimes

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,100
before we do something new or dangerous.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,030
I got my helmet on, I got my parachute on,

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,680
here goes nothing.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,630
By the way, I'll meet you on the ground

8
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,630
and I'll do a little
lesson about phrases

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,220
with the word nothing in it.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,720
Once again, here goes nothing.

11
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:24,854
(plane engine roaring)

12
00:00:24,854 --> 00:00:27,854
(calm guitar music)

13
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,570
Well, hello and welcome
to this English lesson

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,140
about phrases with the
word, nothing in it.

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,750
Before we get started, though,
if this is your first time here,

16
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,000
don't forget to click
that red subscribe button

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,470
and give me a thumbs up if
this video helps you learn

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,110
just a little bit more English.

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,090
The next English phrase,
I wanted to teach you

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,060
with the word nothing in it is the phrase,

21
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,310
there's nothing to it.

22
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,990
When my kids were young,

23
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,940
I had to teach them
how to tie their shoes.

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,040
You take the two laces.
You make a simple knot.

25
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,590
You make a bow, you go around the bow,

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,163
you put your thumb through
and you pull it tight.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,130
There's nothing to it.

28
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,330
So there's nothing to it,
is a phrase we use

29
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,690
when we're talking about
something that's very easy to do,

30
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,500
or very easy to learn.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,680
It does take a while to learn
how to tie a shoe though.

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,940
Saying there's nothing to it

33
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,910
maybe isn't the nicest thing to say.

34
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,570
I know when I was a kid, it
actually took me a long time.

35
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,440
Even though my mom kept
showing me and kept saying,

36
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,760
there's nothing to it.

37
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,330
I was watching an old movie the other day

38
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,440
and the main character was put in prison

39
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,170
and they gave him dry bread and water,

40
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,570
which I guess is better than nothing.

41
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,050
The English phrase better
than nothing means,

42
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,990
that whatever you have is better

43
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,170
than not having anything at all.

44
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,160
If I was really, really hungry
and you gave me dry bread

45
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,050
and water, I would certainly think,

46
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,700
well, it's better than nothing.

47
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,520
It's better to have some bread

48
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,290
and to have a little drink of water

49
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,640
than to have nothing at all.

50
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,533
It's certainly better than nothing.

51
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,860
Ah, there's next to
nothing left in this box.

52
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,860
Sometimes my kids eat all the cereal.

53
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,090
And then when I go to
have a box of cereal,

54
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,880
there's next to nothing left in the box.

55
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,950
Next to nothing is a
phrase we use in English

56
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,130
to talk about when there's some left,

57
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,630
there's some left in the box,
but not as much as I wanted.

58
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,860
There's next to nothing
left in the cereal box.

59
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,070
So that's kind of sad.

60
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,970
I'll have to maybe go to the
store later and get another one

61
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,140
because I really like eating my Cheerios.

62
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,690
It's a little windy out here today.

63
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:35,750
Hey Bob, what are
you doing this weekend?

64
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,120
Nothing much.

65
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,590
Nothing really.

66
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,360
When someone asks you what your plans are,

67
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,010
when someone asks you what
you're going to be doing tomorrow

68
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,270
or on the weekend.

69
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,080
And if you're doing some things,

70
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,400
but they're not that important,

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,170
you might answer by using
one of the two phrases

72
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,150
I just said.

73
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:55,090
You could say nothing
really or nothing much.

74
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,930
These are very common phrases in English.

75
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,990
At work when heading out
the door on a Friday,

76
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:01,887
a colleague might say,

77
00:03:01,887 --> 00:03:03,830
"Hey, Bob, what are you
doing this weekend?"

78
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,230
And probably my most common answer,

79
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:08,890
especially during this year of COVID

80
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,630
would be nothing much or nothing really.

81
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,610
It basically just means
I'm doing some stuff,

82
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,700
but I'm not doing
anything fun or exciting.

83
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,970
Oscar is a really good dog.

84
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,870
He hangs out with Jen when she's working

85
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,170
in the flower fields, he's
very calm, but he does bark

86
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,030
if a stranger comes onto our
property, he's a good dog.

87
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,490
Our last dog though, was kind
of a good for nothing dog.

88
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,790
Good for nothing is a
phrase we use in English

89
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,190
to describe someone or something
that isn't very useful.

90
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,670
Our last dog just slept all
the time. He never barked.

91
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:46,000
He just stayed by his
dog house and he ate food

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,070
and he just wasn't very helpful.

93
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,120
He didn't really hang out with Jen.

94
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,080
He didn't bark when strangers came,

95
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,280
he was kind of a good for nothing dog.

96
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,840
This isn't a nice way to
describe someone or something,

97
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,900
but it's just a way to
describe someone or something

98
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,320
that doesn't really do anything.

99
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,520
In the flower bed behind me,
there's nothing but flowers.

100
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,710
When you say nothing but in English,

101
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,980
it's just another way of saying only.

102
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,700
And in informal English, we
often say sentences like this.

103
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,519
There's nothing but
flowers in this flower bed.

104
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,529
We don't grow vegetables.
We only grow flowers.

105
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:22,650
There's only flowers growing here.

106
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,120
There's nothing but flowers
in the flower bed behind me.

107
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,300
When I was a teenager,

108
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,390
I worked for my uncle building houses.

109
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,417
But one summer he came to me and said,

110
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,720
"Bob, it's nothing personal,

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,640
but I can't give you a job this summer."

112
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,800
My uncle used the phrase,
it's nothing personal

113
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,710
because it had nothing to do with me.

114
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,560
The reason he couldn't give me work

115
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,920
wasn't because I was a bad worker,

116
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,920
it wasn't because he didn't like me.

117
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,000
There simply wasn't enough work.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,920
So the English phrase,
it's nothing personal

119
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,790
is a phrase we use when we're about

120
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,650
to give someone information.

121
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,850
But we want them to be aware
that it's not their fault.

122
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,960
It has nothing to do with
something they've done.

123
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,550
It's nothing personal.

124
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,730
Another really common phrase in English

125
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,960
with the word nothing in it is the phrase.

126
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
It's nothing.

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,220
This is a phrase we use
sometimes instead of saying,

128
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,750
you're welcome after someone
thanks us for doing something.

129
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,720
Many of you in the
comments below, will say,

130
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,630
thanks, Bob, for the English lesson.

131
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,400
And I could respond by
saying, ah, it's nothing.

132
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,720
Basically what I'm saying
is it wasn't that much work,

133
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,100
I enjoy doing it, it didn't cost me a lot

134
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,600
to make the English lesson,

135
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,970
and so I respond by
saying, ah, it's nothing.

136
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,820
It's just another way of
saying you're welcome.

137
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,870
Now if I wanted respond
to people thanking me

138
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,450
for my English lessons in
kind of a cocky, arrogant,

139
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,030
or boastful way I could use the phrase,

140
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,500
you ain't seen nothing yet.

141
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,250
So this is another English phrase

142
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,680
with the word nothing in it

143
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,010
that we use when we are telling people

144
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,980
that things are going to get better

145
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,790
and kind of in a cocky way,

146
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,410
like kind of like, whoa,
you ain't seen nothing yet.

147
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,006
So if you like my English lessons now

148
00:06:03,006 --> 00:06:06,260
just wait I have a lot
of plans for this summer

149
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,420
to make them better and
I could, boastfully say,

150
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,650
you ain't seen nothing yet.

151
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,740
So the best I think is yet to come.

152
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,800
A long time ago, I was working somewhere

153
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,010
and someone was stealing paper regularly.

154
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,900
So I made sure that my boss
knew that I had nothing

155
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,010
to do with it.

156
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,090
I often worked late at that job

157
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,970
and I didn't want my boss to think

158
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,130
that I was the one stealing the paper.

159
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,010
I wanted to make sure that my boss knew

160
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,230
that I had nothing to do with it.

161
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,460
The English phrase, nothing to do with,

162
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,580
simply means that you didn't do it.

163
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,750
You're not associated with
the person who is doing it.

164
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,380
You don't know who's doing it.

165
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,000
You had nothing to do with it.

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,750
Eventually they did catch the person

167
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,740
and that person got fired.

168
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,630
I guess that's what they deserved.

169
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,750
Sometimes people fall in love

170
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,820
and then sometimes they break up.

171
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,130
After they break up,

172
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,540
sometimes they might
say something like this,

173
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,370
he means nothing to me or
she means nothing to me now.

174
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,260
This is a phrase we use in English

175
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,390
to kind of indicate that
we don't have feelings

176
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,670
for someone anymore.

177
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,770
So maybe there is someone in your past

178
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,680
that you really, really
liked romantically,

179
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,450
but now they mean nothing to you.

180
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,560
You don't have those same
strong feelings anymore.

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,020
And that's the phrase that you would use.

182
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,390
You would just say he
means nothing to me now

183
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,920
or she means nothing to me now.

184
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,610
Sometimes sports teams are in
an all or nothing situation.

185
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:31,000
Usually this happens towards the end

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,690
of their regular season.

187
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,790
They're in a situation where
they need to win the game

188
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,210
if they want to move on.

189
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:40,000
If they lose the game,
their season is over.

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,880
And in English, we would
certainly call that

191
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,040
an all or nothing situation.

192
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,530
An all or nothing situation

193
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,210
is a time where either you do well

194
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,900
and you get the reward, or
if you fail at something,

195
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
you don't get anything.

196
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,020
So thankfully learning English

197
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,270
is not an all or nothing situation.

198
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,150
It's not like being in
a championship match,

199
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,900
you can just keep doing
this, keep learning things

200
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,490
and keep doing well.

201
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,710
Well, thank you for
watching this English lesson

202
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,210
about phrases with the word nothing in it.

203
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,720
It was pretty easy for me to make

204
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,130
because I had nothing at all to do today.

205
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,010
Nothing at all, is your last phrase

206
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,860
that I want to teach you in this lesson.

207
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,930
Nothing at all just means
the same thing as nothing,

208
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,840
but we use at all to kind
of emphasize it a bit.

209
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,720
So I had nothing at all to do today

210
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,880
so I thought it would be fun

211
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,430
to make this English lesson for you.

212
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,520
Thanks again for watching.

213
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,600

Give me a thumbs up if
this video helped you learn

216
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,900
just a little bit more English.

217
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,460
And if you have the time,
why don't you stick around

218
