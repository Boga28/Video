1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,700
You're learning English,

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,440
everyone else who's watching
this video is learning English,

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,990
so it might be cool

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,880
if we could find out what
everyone is listening to,

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,730
what everyone is reading,
what everyone is watching

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,540
in order to improve their
grasp of the English language.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,080
So in this video, I'm
going to do two things.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,160
I'm going to share with you the song

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,730
that I'm currently listening to,

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,510
the book that I'm currently reading,

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,580
the TV show that I'm currently watching,

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,250
and the most recent movie that I've seen,

13
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,470
and then I would like you to do the same.

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,320
I would like you,

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,590
there'll be a link, by the way,

16
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,080
in the description, to a Google form,

17
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,460
I would love it if you could share with us

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,560
the English song that you
are currently listening to

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,210
to help you understand English.

20
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,840
What's the English book that
you are currently reading?

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,780
What's the English TV show that
you are currently watching?

22
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,340
And what movie did you watch in English

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,720
just a few days ago or a week ago?

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,900
I will take all that information

25
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,930
and I will put it together in
some nice charts and graphs

26
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,380
and I'll make another video in a week

27
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,730
where I'll show you the results

28
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,820
and then you'll know

29
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:04,080
what all the other English
learners are doing,

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,710
or at least you'll know what
the most popular song is,

31
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,470
the most popular book,
the most popular TV show,

32
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,960
and the most popular movie.

33
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,090
So stick around, I'll share
with you what I'm doing,

34
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,389
and then I'll ask you what you're doing.

35
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:18,972
(upbeat music)

36
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,480
Let's start by talking about songs.

37
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,650
Songs are one of the best
ways to learn a language

38
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,510
because it's so easy to listen to a song

39
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,050
over and over again.

40
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,060
If a song is really good,
you never get bored of it.

41
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,550
You just enjoy listening to it 10 times

42
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,700
or 50 times or 100 times.

43
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,900
The song that I'm currently listening to

44
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,880
is "Save Your Tears" by The Weeknd.

45
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,890
In particular, I really like the version

46
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,950
where Ariana Grande sings along with him.

47
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,440
It's a really cool song.

48
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,480
I think it's actually a good
song for English learners

49
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,610
because it's very easy
to understand The Weeknd

50
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,660
when he sings.

51
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,100
So that's currently my favorite song.

52
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,670
It's great, it has a nice
melody, I just really enjoy it.

53
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,380
So what song are you
currently listening to?

54
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,850
Remember, I wanna collect
information in this video,

55
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,460
so please let us know.

56
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,070
There's a form linked in
the description below.

57
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,090
You can tell me in the
comments if you want

58
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,050
but it will be better for everybody

59
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,510
if you click that link,
fill out that form,

60
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,460
and tell us what song are
you currently listening to

61
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,830
to help improve your English?

62
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,930
I'm curious and I think
everyone else is as well.

63
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,070
Let's talk a little bit about books.

64
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,340
Books are an amazing
way to learn a language,

65
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,390
I think for two reasons,
in my humble opinion.

66
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,700
The first reason I think books are amazing

67
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,760
is because you can read
a book at your own speed.

68
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,700
You can read it quickly or slowly

69
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,430
and you can even reread
parts of it if you want to.

70
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,370
That makes books kind of unique.

71
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,600
The second thing I really like about books

72
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,660
when learning a language

73
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,750
is I think it's the best
way, for me at least,

74
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,050
to learn new vocabulary.

75
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,930
It's really cool, when you read a book,

76
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,810
to learn one or two
new words on every page

77
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,370
or in every paragraph.

78
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,560
So those are the two reasons

79
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,400
I think books are a cool
way to learn a language.

80
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,780
But what am I reading?

81
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,340
I am currently reading a book

82
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,910
called "The Humans" by Matt Haig.

83
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,890
It is a science fiction book.

84
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,180
It is about an alien who
comes to the planet Earth

85
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,400
and kind of takes over
the life of a human being

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,480
and starts to live as a human.

87
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,200
He changes so he looks like a human

88
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,100
and then he lives as a human being.

89
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,370
I don't wanna give away too many spoilers

90
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,320
but it's an interesting book

91
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,400
because you get to see
what humans are like

92
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
from a nonhuman perspective,

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,290
so I'm quite entertained by it.

94
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,400
So that's the book I'm reading.

95
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,640
It's called "The Humans" by Matt Haig,

96
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,610
but I'm curious to know,

97
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,850
and I think everyone else is
as well, what you're reading.

98
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,300
So please let us know
what book you're reading.

99
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,220
And I'm curious to see which
book is the most popular.

100
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,690
It should be interesting.

101
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,220
Let's talk a little bit about TV shows.

102
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,680
TV shows are a great way to learn English

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,740
because you can get to
know the characters.

104
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,810
Maybe the show you are
watching has multiple seasons.

105
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,240
There's season one and
season two and season three

106
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,240
and maybe each season
has a number of episodes,

107
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,090
maybe there's 10 episodes in every season.

108
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,280
This really gives you a chance

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,440
to listen to the same person speak English

110
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,930
over and over again.

111
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,880
You can really start to
understand each individual actor

112
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,490
and the way they speak English.

113
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,810
So TV shows are really cool

114
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,950
in that sense that you get hours of time

115
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,100
listening to the same
people speak English.

116
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,780
But what TV show am I watching?

117
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,470
I'm actually watching
a British crime drama

118
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,220
right now called "Vera."

119
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,090
It's in season 11, there
are 11 seasons of it,

120
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,730
and it's a story about a police detective

121
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,250
and she's very, very smart

122
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,810
and she figures things
out, not always quickly,

123
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,170
but she has a unique way
of investigating the crimes

124
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,220
and a unique way of solving them.

125
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,040
So the show I'm watching
right now is called "Vera."

126
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,520
It's in season 11.

127
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,690
If you are learning English,

128
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,240
if you're learning British English

129
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,987
and you want to watch a crime
drama, I highly recommend it.

130
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:13,500
Eleven seasons of listening
to the same people talk,

131
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,230
that would be really, really good.

132
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:17,560
Anyways, once again, I'm curious

133
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,200
and everyone else is curious
to know what you're watching

134
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,500
so please follow the
link in the description

135
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,280
and let us know.

136
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,620
Let's talk a little bit about movies.

137
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,460
One of the coolest things about movies

138
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,520
is that they are very immersive.

139
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,120
Movies are an escape from life.

140
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,940
When you watch a movie for an
hour and a half or two hours,

141
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,230
you can forget about all the things

142
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,630
that you're worrying about,
if it's a good movie.

143
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,540
Hopefully you're watching a good movie

144
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,780
and it's very immersive

145
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,900
and it allows you to just
forget about all of the worries

146
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,840
you have in life for a little bit.

147
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,710
So that's the cool thing about movies.

148
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,730
Awesome for you as an English learner

149
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,530
if you can watch something
that is very, very immersive

150
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,180
and helps you kind of forget

151
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,140
about the other language you speak.

152
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,650
But what movie did I just recently watch?

153
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,750
The movie I most recently watched

154
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,030
is a movie called "Free
Guy," starring Ryan Reynolds.

155
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,720
By the way, he's Canadian.
I'm not sure if you knew that.

156
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,150
A lot of the, little bit
of Canadian pride here,

157
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,680
a lot of really good actors

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,810
and entertainers in
the world are Canadian.

159
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,900
I'm not sure why.

160
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,470
I think it's because the
winter's so long and cold,

161
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,220
we have to think of ways
to entertain each other.

162
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,260
Anyways, back to the subject at hand.

163
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,020
I watched "Free Guy." I loved it.

164
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,930
It was very entertaining.
It is a great movie.

165
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,950
It's about a guy who actually lives

166
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,910
inside of a computer game

167
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,320
and I'm not gonna say too much more

168
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,800
because I don't wanna
spoil the movie for you.

169
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,380
But anyways, once again,
what are you watching?

170
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,160
Let us know, follow the
link, fill out the form.

171
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,400
I will put a nice list together in a week

172
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,750
and you'll find out what
everyone's favorite movie,

173
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,470
favorite TV show, favorite book,

174
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,020
and what their favorite song is right now.

175
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,480
Well, hey, thank you so much

177
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,410
I hope it helps you to think
about how important it is

178

to read and listen to
music and watch TV shows

179
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,030
and watch movies in English

180
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,950
and I hope that you find
a way to do a lot of that.

181
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,730
