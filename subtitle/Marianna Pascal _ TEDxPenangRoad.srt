00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,262
For the past 20 years,

3
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,686
I've been helping Malaysian
and other Southeast Asians

4
00:00:27,686 --> 00:00:30,234
to speak better English.

5
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:34,894
And through training
thousands of Southeast Asians,

6
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:37,751
I've discovered a very surprising truth.

7
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:42,631
I've discovered that how well
somebody communicates in English

8
00:00:43,102 --> 00:00:46,447
actually has very little to do
with their English level.

9
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:51,476
It has a lot to do
with their attitude towards English.

10
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:56,299
There are people out there
who have a very low level of English,

11
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,808
and they can communicate very, very well.

12
00:00:58,993 --> 00:01:02,736
One of them that I remember was a student,
a participant of mine named Faizal.

13
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:05,038
He was a factory supervisor -

14
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:06,960
English level very, very low -

15
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:11,092
but this guy could just sit
and listen to anybody,

16
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:12,809
very calmly, clearly,

17
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,824
and then he could respond,

18
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:19,192
absolutely express
his thoughts beautifully,

19
00:01:19,223 --> 00:01:20,999
at a very low level of English.

20
00:01:21,024 --> 00:01:23,237
So, today I want to share with you

21
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:27,363
what is so different
about people like Faizal?

22
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:28,816
How do they do it?

23
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,800
And second of all,

24
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:33,071
why is this so important not only to you,

25
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,941
but to your children, to your community,
and to the future of Malaysia?

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,622
And third of all,

27
00:01:38,647 --> 00:01:41,205
what's one thing you can do,
starting today,

28
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,721
if you want to speak
with that calm, clear confidence

29
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,611
that people like Faizal have.

30
00:01:47,951 --> 00:01:49,183
First of all,

31
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,352
what is so different?

32
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:53,106
How do people like Faizal do it?

33
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:54,507
To answer that question,

34
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,895
I'm going to take you back
about 10 years, okay?

35
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,469
I was training staff at that time,

36
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:03,717
and my daughter, at that time,
was taking piano lessons.

37
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:08,693
And I started to notice
two really strong similarities

38
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,588
between my daughter's attitude
or thinking towards playing the piano

39
00:02:14,613 --> 00:02:19,386
and a lot of Malaysians' thinking
or attitude towards English.

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,369
First of all, I should tell you

41
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:24,544
my daughter absolutely hated piano,

42
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:25,933
hated the lessons,

43
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:27,141
hated practicing.

44
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:30,212
This is my daughter
practicing piano, okay?

45
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,767
This is as good as it got.

46
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:33,807
This is the real thing.

47
00:02:34,768 --> 00:02:37,859
And she dreaded going to piano lessons

48
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:41,750
because to my daughter,
going to piano lessons,

49
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,202
she was filled with this sort of dread.

50
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:48,304
Because it was all
about not screwing up, right?

51
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:51,271
Because like a lot of piano students,

52
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:53,556
to both my daughter and her teacher,

53
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:58,859
her success in piano was measured
by how few mistakes she made.

54
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:00,682
At the same time,

55
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:04,092
I noticed that a lot of Malaysians
went into English conversations

56
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:07,596
with the same sort of feeling of dread.

57
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:10,209
This sort of feeling
that they were going to be judged

58
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:12,690
by how many mistakes
they were going to make,

59
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,436
and whether or not
they were going to screw up.

60
00:03:16,753 --> 00:03:21,116
Now, the second similarity
that I noticed was to do with self- image.

61
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:24,460
My daughter, she knew
what good piano sounded like, right?

62
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:26,357
Because we've all heard good piano.

63
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:28,975
And she knew what her level was,

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,927
and she knew how long
she'd have to play for to play like that.

65
00:03:34,726 --> 00:03:36,995
And a lot of Malaysians, I noticed,

66
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,080
had this idea of what good proper English
is supposed to sound like,

67
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,906
and what their - I see a lot of you nod -

68
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:47,271
and what their English sounded like,

69
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,885
and how far they
would have to go to get there.

70
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:55,106
And they also felt like they were -
like my daughter - just bad,

71
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:58,780
bad piano player,
bad English speaker, right?

72
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:02,583
My English not so good, lah.
Cannot. Sorry, yah. Cannot. Ah -

73
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:05,679
So I could see these similarities,

74
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:07,270
but I still couldn't figure out,

75
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:10,995
okay, what is it about these people
like Faizal, that are so different,

76
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:15,095
that can just do it smoothly,
calmly, with confidence?

77
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:18,654
One day, I discovered that answer,

78
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,825
and I discovered it quite by chance.

79
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,443
It was a day when my computer broke down,

80
00:04:23,468 --> 00:04:25,471
and I had to go to a cybercafe.

81
00:04:25,658 --> 00:04:27,428
Okay, it was my first time,

82
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:30,416
and I discovered cybercafes
are disgusting places, okay?

83
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,119
They're really gross.

84
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:35,095
They're smelly,
and they're filled with boys.

85
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,532
And they're all playing noisy,
violent games.

86
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,518
They're just disgusting places.

87
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,610
But I had to go there.

88
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:43,649
So I sat down,

89
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,382
and I started noticing this guy beside me.

90
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:49,819
And I became very interested
in this guy next to me.

91
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,092
Now, this guy is playing this game

92
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:58,160
that is basically, it's like
shooting people until they die.

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,643
And that's it.
(Laughter)

94
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:00,774
That's the game, right?

95
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:04,775
And I'm noticing
that this guy is not very good.

96
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,966
In fact, he's terrible, right?

97
00:05:06,991 --> 00:05:10,161
Because I'm looking,
and I'm seeing, like, a lot of shooting

98
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:13,484
and ... not much dying, right?

99
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:14,611
(Laughter)

100
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:17,377
What really interested me was

101
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:21,516
behind this lousy player
were three of his friends,

102
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,964
sort of standing there watching him play.

103
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,366
What I really noticed was

104
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:28,215
even though this guy was terrible,

105
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,318
even though his friends were watching him,

106
00:05:30,343 --> 00:05:31,690
there was no embarrassment.

107
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:34,034
There was no feeling of being judged.

108
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:35,298
There was no shyness.

109
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:37,543
In fact, quite the opposite.

110
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:40,944
This guy's totally focused
on the bad guys,

111
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:42,521
smile on his face.

112
00:05:43,025 --> 00:05:47,556
All he can think about
is killing these guys, right?

113
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,872
And I'm watching him.

114
00:05:48,897 --> 00:05:51,719
And I suddenly realize: this is it.

115
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,763
This is the same attitude

116
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:59,958
that people like Faizal have
when they speak English,

117
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:01,387
just like this guy.

118
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,600
When Faizal goes
into an English conversation,

119
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:07,060
he doesn't feel judged.

120
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:10,373
He is entirely focused
on the person that he's speaking to

121
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:12,754
and the result he wants to get.

122
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,714
He's got no self-awareness,

123
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,537
no thoughts about his own mistakes.

124
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:23,375
I want to share with you
a real, true example, to paint a picture,

125
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,396
of somebody who speaks English
like they are playing piano

126
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,890
and someone who speaks English
like they are playing a computer game.

127
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:32,610
And this is a true story.

128
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,062
It happened to me.

129
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,036
A while ago, I was in a pharmacy.

130
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,608
I had to buy omega;

131
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,543
my doctor said I should get omega.

132
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:43,442
And I go to the shelf,

133
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:44,845
there's tons of omega,

134
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,788
there's omega that's high in DHA,

135
00:06:46,788 --> 00:06:49,913
omega that's high in EPA,

136
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:51,708
and I don't know which one to buy.

137
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:54,603
Now, the sales rep happened to be there.

138
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:57,943
And I saw she's like
this well-dressed, professional woman.

139
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:01,854
I walk over to her,
and I see this look as she sees me,

140
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,892
this sort of - it's a look
I recognize very well.

141
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:06,192
Her eyes go all wide.

142
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,362
It's sort of that panic:

143
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:10,057
Oh my God! I've got to speak
to a native speaker;

144
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,954
she's going to judge me
and notice my mistakes.

145
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:16,284
I go up to her,
and I explain my situation:

146
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:18,808
which omega do I get?

147
00:07:18,833 --> 00:07:20,988
And she starts explaining to me

148
00:07:20,989 --> 00:07:25,877
everything about DHA and EPA
you could possibly imagine.

149
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:29,504
She speaks very quickly,
goes all around in circles.

150
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,476
And when she finishes,

151
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:34,064
no idea what to buy.

152
00:07:34,212 --> 00:07:35,220
(Laughter)

153
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:38,397
So I turn to the girl behind the counter.

154
00:07:38,422 --> 00:07:40,023
Now, the girl behind the counter,

155
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:42,506
I heard her before,
her English level is very low.

156
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:44,851
But when I walk over to her,

157
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,046
this girl,

158
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,029
there's no fear.

159
00:07:48,054 --> 00:07:50,085
In fact, she's just looking at me.

160
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:51,222
You know that look?

161
00:07:51,246 --> 00:07:53,122
Like...Yeah?
Okay...So, how?

162
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:54,269
(Laughter)

163
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,579
Yeah, I've been in Malaysia a long time.

164
00:07:56,604 --> 00:07:58,118
(Laughter)

165
00:07:58,685 --> 00:08:02,527
So, I go up to her and I explain
the problem, EPA and DHA.

166
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:04,231
She looks at me, she says,

167
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:06,248
"Okay, yeah. "

168
00:08:06,663 --> 00:08:10,020
"Ah, EPA for heart."

169
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:14,224
"DHA for brain."

170
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:15,418
(Laughter)

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,648
"Your heart okay or not?"

172
00:08:18,673 --> 00:08:20,195
(Laughter)

173
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,243
So I said,

174
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:23,188
"Yeah, yeah,"

175
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:26,634
I said, "my heart is really,
I think it's pretty good."

176
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:27,933
She says,

177
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,419
"Your brain okay or not?"

178
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:32,847
(Laughter)

179
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,616
I said, "No. No, my brain
is not as good as it used to be."

180
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,967
She looks and says,

181
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,001
"Okay lah, you take Omega DHA!"

182
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:44,384
(Laughter)

183
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,856
Problem solved, right?

184
00:08:45,881 --> 00:08:48,852
So we've got two different
kinds of communicators.

185
00:08:48,877 --> 00:08:51,284
We've got the one who's got a high level,

186
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,719
but totally focused on herself
and getting it right,

187
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,153
and therefore, very ineffective.

188
00:08:57,915 --> 00:08:59,420
We've got another one,

189
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:00,956
low-level,

190
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:05,303
totally focused on the person
she's talking to and getting a result.

191
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:06,841
Effective.

192
00:09:06,866 --> 00:09:08,485
And therein lies the difference.

193
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:15,445
Now, why is this distinction so important
not just to you, to your children,

194
00:09:15,445 --> 00:09:19,142
but to the future of Malaysia
and countries like Malaysia?

195
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,855
And to answer that, let's take a look

196
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:26,052
at who actually is speaking English
in the world today, okay?

197
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,206
So, if we looked at all of the English
conversations in the whole world,

198
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:34,206
taking place right now on planet Earth,

199
00:09:34,738 --> 00:09:38,503
we would see that for every
native speaker, like me,

200
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:42,630
there are five non-native speakers.

201
00:09:44,154 --> 00:09:48,710
And if we'd listen to every conversation
in English on planet Earth right now,

202
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:54,826
we would notice
that 96% of those conversations

203
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,205
involved non-native English speakers -

204
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,450
only 4% of those conversations
are native speaker to native speaker.

205
00:10:03,475 --> 00:10:05,420
This is not my language anymore,

206
00:10:05,445 --> 00:10:07,464
this language belongs to you.

207
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:10,604
It's not an art to be mastered;

208
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,258
it's just a tool to use to get a result.

209
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:19,222
And I want to give you a real-life example
of what English is today in the world,

210
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:20,788
real English today.

211
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,303
This is another true story.

212
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:26,951
I was at a barbecue a little while ago -

213
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,715
this was a barbecue for engineers,

214
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,123
engineers from all over the world.

215
00:10:31,504 --> 00:10:33,581
And they were making hot dogs.

216
00:10:33,606 --> 00:10:36,544
Some of the hot dogs
were regular hot dogs,

217
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,396
and some were these cheese hot dogs,
you know, with the cheese in the middle.

218
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:43,620
A French engineer is cooking the hot dogs,

219
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,997
and he turns to this Korean engineer,

220
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:50,103
and he says, "Would you like a hot dog?"

221
00:10:51,052 --> 00:10:53,616
And the Korean guy says, "Yes, please!"

222
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:56,727
He says, "Do you want the cheese?"

223
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,609
And the Korean guy 
looks around at the table,

224
00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:02,961
he says, "I no see cheese."

225
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,920
The French guy says,
"The hot dog is contains the cheese."

226
00:11:07,945 --> 00:11:09,333
(Laughter)

227
00:11:10,023 --> 00:11:12,373
The Korean guy
doesn't understand him, right?

228
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,124
So the French engineer tries again.

229
00:11:16,265 --> 00:11:21,858
"The hot dog is ... making
from ... with the cheese."

230
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,544
Korean guy still doesn't understand.

231
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:26,006
He tries again,

232
00:11:26,006 --> 00:11:30,159
he says, "The hotdog is coming from -

233
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:32,300
No, the cheese is coming
from the hot dog."

234
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,325
(Laughter)

235
00:11:33,349 --> 00:11:35,133
Korean guy cannot understand.

236
00:11:35,158 --> 00:11:39,404
Now there's a Japanese engineer
who's been listening to this conversation,

237
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:41,447
turns to the Korean engineer

238
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:45,118
and he says, "Ah! Cheese ... integrator!"

239
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,554
(Laughter)

240
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:48,457
He understands, okay.

241
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:49,519
(Laughter)

242
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:50,781
Everybody understands.

243
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:53,700
So, this is what English is today.

244
00:11:53,725 --> 00:11:57,332
It's just a tool to play
around with to get a result,

245
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,117
like a computer game.

246
00:12:01,265 --> 00:12:06,586
Now, the challenge is that we know
in schools all around the world,

247
00:12:06,747 --> 00:12:10,771
English is not really being taught
like it's a tool to play with.

248
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:14,497
It's still being taught
like it's an art to master.

249
00:12:14,522 --> 00:12:19,740
And students are judged
more on correctness than on clarity.

250
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:27,401
Some of you might remember
the old comprehension exam in school.

251
00:12:27,426 --> 00:12:29,003
Does everybody remember in school

252
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:32,839
when you'd get a question
about a text that you read,

253
00:12:32,864 --> 00:12:35,298
you'd have to read
through some text, right?

254
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:39,685
And then answer a question
to show that you understood the text?

255
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:45,490
And this may have happened to you
that you showed you understood the text,

256
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:49,790
but you got a big X because you made
a little grammar mistake.

257
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:51,722
Like this student.

258
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:55,075
This student clearly
understood paragraph four.

259
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,222
But no, not correct!

260
00:12:57,247 --> 00:13:01,523
Because he left the letter N
off the word "environment."

261
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:04,899
But in the real world, what would matter?

262
00:13:05,254 --> 00:13:08,568
In the real world, what would matter is
did you understand the email,

263
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:13,188
or did you understand your customer
so that you can go ahead and take action?

264
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:17,360
Now, the problem that I see here,

265
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,121
over and over,

266
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:24,132
is that people take the attitude
they developed about English in school,

267
00:13:24,157 --> 00:13:28,318
and they bring it into their adult life
and into their work.

268
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,971
And if you're in a stressful situation,

269
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:33,574
and you're having a conversation,

270
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:38,963
and you're trying to give a result 
to someone and say it correctly,

271
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,688
your brain multi-tasks,
it cannot do two things at once.

272
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,329
And what I see is
the brain just shutting down.

273
00:13:45,803 --> 00:13:50,271
And you may recognize these three symptoms
of the brain shutting down.

274
00:13:51,572 --> 00:13:55,105
The first one is that your listening goes.

275
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,710
Someone is talking to you,
and you're so busy thinking

276
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:03,504
about how you're going to respond
and express yourself correctly,

277
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,994
you don't actually hear
what the other person said.

278
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:09,352
And I can see a lot
of nodding in the audience.

279
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:12,168
The second thing to go is your speaking.

280
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:14,320
Your mind sort of shuts down,

281
00:14:14,345 --> 00:14:18,099
and that vocabulary you do know
just disappears,

282
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,988
and the words don't come out.

283
00:14:21,534 --> 00:14:23,615
The third thing to go is your confidence.

284
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,037
The worst thing about this is

285
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:31,523
you may only be [un]confident because
you cannot express yourself clearly,

286
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,745
but to the person talking to you,

287
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,842
they may misunderstand this

288
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:40,887
as a lack of confidence
in your ability to do the job, to perform.

289
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,678
So if you want to speak English
like Faizal with that great confidence,

290
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:50,869
here's the one thing that you can do.

291
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:54,678
When you speak, don't focus on yourself.

292
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:59,472
Focus on the other person
and the result you want to achieve.

293
00:15:00,478 --> 00:15:03,848
Imagine a next generation of Malaysians,

294
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:09,771
all with that wonderful confidence
in communication that Faizal has,

295
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,415
at any level of English.

296
00:15:12,523 --> 00:15:13,825
Because let's remember

297
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,437
that English today
is not an art to be mastered,

298
00:15:17,437 --> 00:15:21,236
it's just a tool to use to get a result.

299
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:24,411
And that tool belongs to you.

300
00:15:26,904 --> 00:15:27,911
Thank you.

301
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,309
(Applause)
