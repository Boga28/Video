4
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:15,749
PLEASE WELCOME OUR GOOD FRIEND
PROFESSOR THE LORD ROBERT

5
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:15,982
WINSTON.

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,751
THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK TO SEE
US.

7
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:18,952
WE LOVE IT WHEN YOU STOP BY.

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,520
ALL RIGHT.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,224
SO ROBERT, WE ARE READY, WE'RE
IN THE ZONE.

10
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,558
LET'S GET OUR SCIENCE ON.

11
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,128
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE DOING
FIRST.

12
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,129
>> LET'S START WITH THE THING AT
THE END.

13
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:30,230
>> James: WITH THIS.

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,597
>> COME AROUND.

15
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:32,399
>> James: OKAY.

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,201
>> SO BASICALLY YOU HAVE GOT
QUITE A SMART WHITE COAT ON.

17
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:40,940
>> James: YES, I'M A
SCIENTIST.

18
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,341
>> IT'S TOO SMART.

19
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:41,708
>> James: WHAT?

20
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:41,941
ROBERT.

21
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,342
WHAT IS.

22
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:48,548
>> LOOK, YOU ARE A BIT BLUER.

23
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,517
THAT SUIT ISN'T WORTH ANYTHING,
IS IT?

24
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:55,655
>> James: WELL, IT'S WORTH A
LITTLE BIT, YEAH.

25
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:57,757
>> THIS IS A SOLUTION TO DRY
CLEANING.

26
00:00:57,757 --> 00:00:58,725
>> James: RIGHT.

27
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,294
>> THAT WAS ALKALI.

28
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:05,031
AND IT IS BLUE BECAUSE IT HAS A
BLUE DIE IN IT AND WE ARE GOING

29
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,467
TO SKIRT YOU WITH ACID TO
NEUTRALIZE IT.

30
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:08,935
>> James: HANG ON.

31
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:13,907
WHAT DO YOU MEAN.

32
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,208
LOOK AT THAT?

33
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:15,408
LOOK.

34
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,976
AND THEN IT.

35
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:17,944
>> IT'S RUBBISH.

36
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:22,649
THIS IS CARBON DIE OXIDE, SO
CARBONIC ACID IS ACTUALLY MUCH

37
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:23,216
MORE EFFECTIVE.

38
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,585
>> James: OKAY.

39
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:32,959
LET ME STAND WELL BACK.

40
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,630
NOW WAIT FOR THE REACTION.

41
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,666
LOOK, ALMOST CLEAN.

42
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:45,672
(APPLAUSE).

43
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:48,842
>> James: RIGHT, I FEEL LIKE
THIS ISN'T EVEN A SCIENCE THING,

44
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:52,212
YOU'VE JUST COME UP WITH SOME
WAY TO DO THAT TO ME.

45
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,047
THAT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

46
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,282
THAT'S AMAZING.

47
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:56,649
IT'S JUST GONE.

48
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:59,552
I MEAN IT'S FREEZING COLD, I
WILL GIVE IT THAT.

49
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,654
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOTS FOR US,
WHAT ELSE.

50
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,590
>> LET ME SEE, WE'VE GOT THIS.

51
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,325
>> James: WHAT IS THAT?

52
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:10,663
>> THAT IS LACAPODIUM POWDER.
AND ST QUITE EXPLOSIVE.

53
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:13,366
SO YOU CAN-- DO YOU WANT TO TRY
LIGHTING IT.

54
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,301
>> James: NO.

55
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:15,668
>> GO ON.

56
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:19,806
>> James: WHEN YOU SAY QUITE
EXPLOSIVE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

57
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,409
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN, HOW
EXPLOSIVE IS THIS.

58
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,744
>> SEVEN.

59
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:25,044
(LAUGHTER).

60
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,779
>> James: THAT FEELS A LOT.

61
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:26,980
RIGHT.

62
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,885
WHAT AM I DOING, JUST LIGHTING
THIS.

63
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,854
>> THESE ARE EXCEPTIONALLY FINE
PARTICLES THEY ARE ABOUT

64
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,822
1,000th MILL MEETER ACROSS.

65
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:36,556
ALL PACKED TOGETHER.

66
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:40,827
THEY COME FROM A PLANT CALLED
LACAPODIUM.

67
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:47,467
AND IT'S A MOSS AND IT'S USED BY
ALL SORTS OF HOMEOPO, THIS IS TO

68
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:54,507
CURE DIARRHEA, SUPPOSED TO BE AN
APHRODISIA BUT IT ALSO IS

69
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:54,774
EXPLOSIVE.

70
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:58,211
>> James: IT CURES DIARRHEA
AND IS ALSO AN APHRODISIAC.

71
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:01,047
>> IT IS HOMOPATHIC SO IT
PROBABLY DOESN'T WORK.

72
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,250
>> James: SO WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN WHEN I LIGHT THIS.

73
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,722
>> LET'S JUST HAVE A LOOK.

74
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,791
>> IT'S NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE, IS
IT?

75
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,160
>> James: WELL, I MEAN, IS
THAT IT?

76
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,329
>> YOU SEE, IT'S A VERY FINE
POWDER.

77
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,730
I WILL SHOW YOU HOW FINE IT IS.

78
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,869
IF WE PUT IT IN THIS WATER.

79
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,037
>> James: YEAH, PUT IT ON
WATER, THAT WILL SET IT ON FIRE,

80
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,270
ROBERT.

81
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,139
I MEAN WHO IS THE SCIENTIST.

82
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,508
>> IT'S HIDE DRO PHOBIC NOW.

83
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:32,745
THIS ISN'T TERRIBLY POISONOUS SO
PUT YOUR FINGER THROUGH THAT

84
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:32,946
DUST.

85
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:36,216
>> James: WHEN YOU SAY
TERRIBLY POISONOUS, I WANT IT TO

86
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:41,921
BE NOT POISONOUS OR POISONNIST
ONCE PUT YOUR PING-- FINGER IN.

87
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,057
>> James: REALLY, ARE YOU
SURE.

88
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,424
>> YES.

89
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,058
GENTLY.

90
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,628
NO, NO, THROUGH THE POWDER, NOT
IN THE WATER.

91
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,663
>> James: WHAT DO YOU MEAN.

92
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:51,331
>> LIKE THAT.

93
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,467
>> James: OH, LOOK, OH, WOW.

94
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,202
>> SO BASICALLY IT IS COMPLETELY
DRY.

95
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:56,970
>> James: YEAH.

96
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,006
>> BECAUSE IT IS PROTECTING MY
FINGER AGAINST THE WATER BECAUSE

97
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:00,940
OF THE SURFACE TENSION.

98
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,976
NOW WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO.

99
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:07,847
WE WILL MAKE SOMETHING A LITTLE
BIT MORE CHALLENGING.

100
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,214
>> James: OKAY.

101
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,582
>> I'VE GOT SOME OF THE POWDER
IN THIS SHOE.

102
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,185
AND I WANT YOU TO BE ABSOLUTELY,
YOU MUST PROMISE ME.

103
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,686
>> James: YES.

104
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:17,557
>> THAT YOU WILL BLOW INTO THIS
SHOE AND NOT SUCK IT.

105
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:18,690
>> James: SURE, YES.

106
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,791
>> HOLD IT LIKE THAT.

107
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:24,030
>> James: I HAVE DONE THIS AT
THE SIDE OF THE ROW BEFORE.

108
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,332
>> James: PUT YOUR GOGGLES ON.

109
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:26,566
>> OKAY.

110
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,967
>> James: ALL RIGHT.

111
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,335
>> I'M GOING IT LIGHT THIS
THING.

112
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,069
>> James: YEAH.

113
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:34,540
>> AND YOU'RE GOING TO BLOW, NOT
TOO HARD, FAIRLY CONTINUOUSLY

114
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,478
GENTLY AND I AM GOING TO TRY AND
SET THE WHOLE THEATER UPON FIRE.

115
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,281
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, DON'T DO IT
UNTIL I TELL YOU.

116
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:47,587
>> James: DON'T WORRY, I'M IN
NO RUSH.

117
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,722
>> GO.

118
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:57,497
(APPLAUSE)
>> SO BASICALLY THAT WORKS CUZ

119
00:04:57,497 --> 00:05:00,166
THOSE PARTICLES, THOSE LITTLE
SEEDS ARE FULL OF FAT.

120
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,534
>> James: YEAH.

121
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:05,104
>> AND THAT FAT IGNITES AND WHEN
THE PARTICLES ARE MIXING WITH

122
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,441
OXYGEN AND SEPARATED FROM EACH
OTHER THEY CAN OXIDIZE, THEY CAN

123
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:08,641
BURN.

124
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,542
>> James: THAT'S AMAZING.

125
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:12,812
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR US NOW,
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE.

126
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:13,346
>> COME ON THE FRONT.

127
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,480
>> James: OKAY.

128
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,516
ALL RIGHT.

129
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,084
>> WATCH THESE TWO BA BE LOOS.

130
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:20,286
ONE HAS BEEN BLOWN UP WITH
ORDINARY AIR.

131
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,821
>> James: WHAT IS IN THAT ONE.

132
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,855
>> THAT ONE IS REALLY HEAVY.

133
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:23,856
>> James: YES STRKS.

134
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,524
WHAT IS IN THERE.

135
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:30,697
>> PICK IT UP AND SEE T IS
SULFUR HEXO FLOUR IDENTIFY WHICH

136
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,866
IS ONE THE HEAVIEST GASES
AVAILABLE, ABOUT SIX TIMES

137
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,468
HEAVIER THAN ATMOSPHERIC AIR.

138
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,269
>> James: RIGHT.

139
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,605
>> WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO BECAUSE
IT IS A VERY, VERY DENSE GAS BUT

140
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:40,740
NOT UNTIL I TELL YOU.

141
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,641
>> James: OKAY.

142
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:47,180
>> I WANT YOU TO INHALE IT, AND
THEN-- .

143
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,382
>> James: I DON'T THINK IT'S
THAT SORT OF BALLOON, REG.

144
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:50,083
GO ON.

145
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,551
YOU WANT ME TO INHALE IT.

146
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:55,555
>> I WANT TO YOU INHALE IT BUT
YOU MUSTANT INHALE TOO MUCH OF

147
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:58,825
IT BECAUSE IT WILL FILL YOUR
LUNGS AND DISPLACE ALL THE

148
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:01,294
OXYGEN AND THAT MIGHT BE A BIT
SAD, REALLY.

149
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:06,499
>> James: ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
HANG ON.

150
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,900
>>S THAT A ENOUGH.

151
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,901
>> James: OKAY.

152
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,337
OH MY GOD.

153
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:16,909
OARKSZ MY GOD.

154
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:17,343
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

155
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,478
I'M NOT EVEN PUTTING A VOICE ON
MY VOICE.

156
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:25,585
IS I SOUND LIKE THE STAR OF THE
RUN SO HARD.

157
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:25,952
>> PLEASE CUFF.

158
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,122
>> James: HOW LONG WILL IT
STAY LIKE THIS, HOW LONG WILL IT

159
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:29,789
STAY LIKE THIS.

160
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,457
WHEN DOES IT.

161
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:31,758
>> BREATHE.

162
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,925
>> James: WHEN WILL IT COME
BACK.

163
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,094
>> GIVE IT TO REGGIE, HIS VOICE
IS-- .

164
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:37,730
>> James: ARE YOU GOING TO DO
SOME REG, ARE YOU?

165
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:37,964
OKAY.

166
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:40,600
GO ON.

167
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,835
OKAY.

168
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,237
OKAY.

169
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,606
>> James: I FEEL LIKE MINE IS
COMING BACK.

170
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,908
HAS IT COME BACK OR HAVE I GOT
USED TO IT.

171
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,812
OKAY, REG, NOT TOO MUCH.

172
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,183
>> Reggie: EVERYBODY'S GOT IT
GOING DOWN TO THE STORE AND BUY

173
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,320
SOME-- EVERYBODY NEEDS A LITTLE
CABBAGES, WHAT, IT'S LIKE

174
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,356
INHALING FREEON.

175
