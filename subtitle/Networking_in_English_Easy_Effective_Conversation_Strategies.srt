1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,860
When you hear the word networking.

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:05,760
I know you know exactly what that means.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,900
Networking means meeting new
people, starting conversations,

4
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,970
and even engaging in small talk.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,020
If you're someone who's naturally
shy and introverted, like I am,

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,980
that can sound like the nightmare
scenario. Not only that,

7
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:23,280
but networking in English
may be a challenge.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,720
You're never sure of the right questions
to ask or how to best follow the

9
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,630
conversation. Plus at the end of the day,

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,840
what you really want is meaningful,

11
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,910
engaging conversation.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,050
So when there are opportunities
for you to network in English,

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,330
you might turn them down, but
here's the problem. You know,

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,930
that networking can lead
to amazing opportunities.

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,190
It can lead to new career
connections, job promotions,

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,370
positions at a new company, new clients,

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,520
and even lifelong friendships.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,340
So as an international English speaker,

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,620
who struggles with networking in English,

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,060
how can you muster up the
motivation needed to engage in those

21
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,570
opportunities and do it
with confidence in English,

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,820
maybe even enjoy it. I'm Annemarie

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm going to share with you six
powerful and instantly effective tips to

26
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:36,510
help you network in English so that
you can meet new people easily.

27
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,510
Even if you're an
introvert or naturally shy.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,173
[Inaudible].

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,970
Tip number one, prepare in advance.

30
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,710
Do you ever think that some people
seem to love networking and they

31
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:56,940
seem to do it easily? It's like they
don't even have to think about it.

32
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:01,260
They can just jump into a group of
people and start conversations and make

33
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:03,540
connections without
even thinking about it.

34
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,540
If you've ever had that
thought you're right,

35
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,220
networking does come more
easily to some than others.

36
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,230
Research indicates that introverts
need more time to think and process

37
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:17,130
information.

38
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,380
We can be easily overwhelmed
by noise crowds and

39
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,380
increased stimuli, which leads to anxiety.

40
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,200
And as our anxiety increases,

41
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,040
it makes it more difficult for us to
think clearly or be in the moment.

42
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,110
As the author of the introvert
advantage explains an introvert's

43
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:41,910
brain actually works
harder to process events,

44
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,670
thoughts, feelings, and interactions.

45
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,740
There is literally a longer
neuro pathway for information to

46
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:51,330
travel as a result.

47
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:56,130
It's no surprise that introverts
often need or prefer to

48
00:02:56,131 --> 00:03:00,310
have time to think before
they speak or in responding to

49
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,210
questions.

50
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,220
And that's exactly why preparing
in advance is effective when you're

51
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,550
getting ready to go to a
networking event in English. Well,

52
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:13,120
the first thing you can do is
consider what kind of event it is.

53
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:18,220
Is it a formalized professional
networking event, or is it a dinner party?

54
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:22,120
What kinds of people might
you be meeting at that event?

55
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,040
And then prepare the questions that
you would like to ask in advance.

56
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,360
Have a list of three, four or
five questions that, you know,

57
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,090
you can use with almost anyone you meet.

58
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:39,250
This is something I often do anytime
I know I'll be meeting new people.

59
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,610
I always have a list of
questions prepared to use.

60
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,740
Another way to prepare in advance
is to plan to limit your time

61
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,574
there.

62
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,290
If networking is a challenge
and it drains your energy don't

63
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,840
plan to spend hours at an event,

64
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,730
if you don't need to give yourself
a limited amount of time that you

65
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:04,390
will be at the event and fully
engaged during that time.

66
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,870
And then when you're ready,
you can leave. When, you know,

67
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,900
in advance that you're only going
to be there for a short time.

68
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,730
It can help you get and keep
the motivation you need to be

69
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:19,150
present and start those
conversations successfully.

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,460
Tip number two is change your
mindset as someone who is interested

71
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:25,540
in personal growth,

72
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,370
I'm sure that you've already implemented
this strategy in many other areas of

73
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:30,791
your life.

74
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:35,710
So you know how effective it can be rather
than views small talk and networking

75
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:37,240
as a necessary evil,

76
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:42,400
you can shift your mindset just a
bit and think of it as an opportunity

77
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,050
to engage in meaningful
conversation or develop meaningful

78
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:52,000
relationships. On top of that,
instead of going into an event,

79
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:56,260
thinking this is going to take forever
and I'm going to be so tired when I'm

80
00:04:56,261 --> 00:05:00,460
finished again, you can shift
that mindset just a bit to:

81
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,840
I can be positive and engaging
for one hour at this event.

82
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,610
And instead of thinking, I
never know what to say or ask.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,190
You can shift your mindset to,

84
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,330
I only need two or three
questions to get others talking.

85
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,620
And that is the perfect opportunity
for me to introduce tip number three,

86
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,420
use your secret weapon as an
introvert and ask questions.

87
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,240
Introverts are natural question askers,

88
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,410
and you can use this to your advantage
when you don't want to be in the

89
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:36,460
spotlight or you don't know what to
say, let others do all the talking.

90
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:41,560
And here's an effective way to do that
when you're preparing your questions in

91
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,310
advance,

92
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,200
avoid focusing on questions that
have a simple yes or no answer,

93
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,560
for example, are you having a
good time or do you like the food?

94
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,850
Those questions can
have a simple yes or no.

95
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,890
And that immediately shuts
down the conversation.

96
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,110
Instead in your preparation
focus on questions that require

97
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,640
detailed answers.

98
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:09,620
We call these open questions in English
and they're easy to identify because

99
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:14,270
they start with question words,
such as who, what, when, where,

100
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,930
why, how, how many, how
long, how often and so on.

101
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,340
Here are just a few examples
of fantastic open questions.

102
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,710
What's been the highlight
of your year so far?

103
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,930
What project are you working on right now?

104
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,500
What exciting opportunities are
on the horizon for your team?

105
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,600
How did you get into your profession?

106
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,960
What challenges do you think the
industry is facing right now,

107
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,180
before I move on to tip number four,

108
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:41,690
there's one added benefit of
asking these open questions.

109
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:46,040
They naturally make you more interesting.

110
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,190
I know that sounds a little bit strange,

111
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:54,620
but individuals who are
effective at asking questions are

112
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,940
interesting people to talk
to. If you don't believe me,

113
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:03,080
I recommend that you check out my lesson
titled how to be cool and interesting

114
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:06,230
in English. What you
discover might surprise you.

115
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,330
And now tip number four,

116
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,640
find common areas of interest
as you ask your great open

117
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:17,810
ended questions, listen
carefully. As you do that,

118
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,890
you'll quickly identify
common areas of interest.

119
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,660
And this is what can lead to
more meaningful conversation and

120
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,670
lasting relationships.

121
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,120
A great way to show someone
that you're listening carefully.

122
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,600
And you've identified an
area of common interest.

123
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,220
Something that you want to talk more
about is to reflect back to them.

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,930
What you've heard, what that means
is repeating what you heard them say.

125
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,110
And turning that into a
question. For example,

126
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,100
maybe you're at a social networking
event with everyone in the company.

127
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,680
While you're chatting with
one of your colleagues.

128
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:59,600
You hear her say that she's been
really struggling with how to implement

129
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:04,580
all these new policies and rules around
the budget this year to show that you

130
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:09,320
heard her and that you have
found something of interest
that you want to keep

131
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:11,180
talking. You could say,

132
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,750
you mentioned that it's been a real
struggle to implement some of these new

133
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,000
policies. So how's it going?

134
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:20,930
Have you been successful and where
do you still have some challenges?

135
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,520
Do you see how I did that?

136
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,440
I repeated what I heard and I used
it to continue the conversation.

137
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,910
Here are some other ways you can do
that. Oh, you play tennis. So do I,

138
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,350
where do you like to play? I love cooking
too. What's your favorite cuisine?

139
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,610
I heard you say you're into hiking.
Where do you usually go on the weekends?

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,220
And that leads me into tip number five,

141
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,360
which is make it easy to
participate in the conversation.

142
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,330
If you've planned your
questions in advance,

143
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,200
then make sure that you're
also ready to answer those same

144
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,800
questions. Have you ever noticed
that when you ask a question,

145
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:02,010
most people will answer and
then say, and what about you?

146
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,430
Where do you like to hike on the
weekends? Or where do you play tennis?

147
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,750
And that is the evolution of
turn-taking in a conversation.

148
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,910
Every good conversation has
back and forth where everyone

149
00:09:14,911 --> 00:09:18,750
participates. So when you're
following tip number one,

150
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,240
and you're preparing your
questions in advance,

151
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,550
make sure that you're selecting questions,

152
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,560
that you're also ready and
willing to answer. So for example,

153
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,340
if you're going to ask the question,
what have you been working on lately?

154
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,290
Be sure to take time,

155
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:38,670
to also prepare your own answer to
that question so that you feel well

156
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:41,310
prepared and ready to go. And finally,

157
00:09:41,311 --> 00:09:45,900
our last tip for networking in English
so that it's easy to meet other people.

158
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,690
Even if you're an introvert is be genuine.

159
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,340
It is absolutely okay if
you're not comfortable when

160
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:57,600
networking and it's also
okay, to be honest about it,

161
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,800
you might be surprised to discover
how many people feel the same way.

162
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,611
For example,

163
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:07,230
if you're meeting peers at
an international conference
and you have no idea how

164
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,550
to start a conversation,

165
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,150
and it feels a little awkward
to just introduce yourself,

166
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,380
