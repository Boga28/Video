00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,850
Hello, everyone. Let me read an excerpt
for you from my book. "We shall soon see

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,020
that the hand is divided into three
zones or parts, which are bound by

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:25,290
certain lines to be hereafter. 
hereafter explained." Huh? Did you

4
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,729
understand any of that? I didn't. So,
one of my things that I like to do is

5
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:39,390
really, really get you out of your
textbook, and get you into speaking

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,050
real-life English. And we can do this
with private lessons. I have a website,

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,800
www.englishwithronnie.com, where I teach
you all the proper things, all the fun

8
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,350
things, and how to speak naturally; not
like a person from — oh, I don't know —

9
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,630
the 1800s. And in today's lesson, we're
going to go through some of these

10
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:09,480
things; things that you've learned in
grammar books — oh, god — things that

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,590
you've learned in your classes or from
people. And, honestly, we just don't use

12
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,220
them when we speak normally to people.
Idioms. That's number two. But let's

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,560
start with number two. I'm never going
to go to a shopping center or the

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,200
grocery store, and use idioms when I'm
speaking to people. Nowhere would I use

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,960
an idiom. And to prove my theory, I
spent two hours listening to the radio.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:51,960
More than that. And nobody in the land
of radio used an idiom. So, take your

17
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,730
idioms, throw them away. Okay? Just
learn to speak normally. But we're going

18
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,390
to get back to those.

19
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,300
Let's look with the first one. Look at
the first one. "Who" and "whom". Wow.

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:13,530
So: "Whom do you trust?" Mm, unless
you're living in the 1800s, we would

21
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,220
just never use the word: "whom". Okay?
So, take it out of your vocabulary; you

22
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,130
don't need that. Just put: "who". We
would say: "Who do you trust?" You can

23
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:34,530
trust me. But this word: "whom" — take
it out; we never say it. But there's one

24
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,360
thing you have to know when you're
learning English: You have to know your

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,170
purpose. Are you learning English
because you'd like to be a creative

26
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,700
writer? Hey, if you want to be a
creative writer, maybe you want to learn

27
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,340
to use "whom", but this is all about
speaking and communicating with people.

28
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,890
If you're working at a job or you'd like
to get a job where they use a very

29
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:08,460
formal 1800 language — maybe you want to
learn about "whom", but no. But know who

30
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,700
you are, know your audience, know who
you're talking to. Old people — they're

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,330
cool to hang out with — they're probably
are not going to say: "whom" either. So,

32
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,650
get that out of your brain.

33
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,880
As I said, the wonderful idioms. Here's
one: "The grass is always greener on the

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,670
other side." You're not gonna have a
conversation with this about someone.

35
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,600
You're not gonna be walking down the
street and go: "Wow. There's that really

36
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,630
hot guy I want to talk to. Hey, how's it
going? The grass is always".  What? No,

37
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,000
just talk to the people like normal
humans. "Hi. How are you?" This is one

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,700
thing that I.  never ceases to amaze me
about high-level English courses. I see

39
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,210
all these high-level English courses,
and people who are advanced in English,

40
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,280
and they're studying idioms. It's like:
"Oh my god. There has to be more than

41
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,450
idioms." Don't worry about idioms. If
you want to learn idioms, because

42
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,130
they're fun and clever, go ahead; but
we're not going to use them in normal

43
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,140
speech. So, be careful what you're
studying in your advanced or

44
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,850
intermediate classes.

45
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:30,160
Oh, everyone hates it. Yes! Present
perfect. Guess what? You don't need to

46
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,530
use it. Now, if you're just beginning to
learn to speak English: Just use the

47
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,840
simple past — it's all you need. If
you're advancing and you're getting the

48
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,650
hang of things in English, and you'd
like to improve your English, of course,

49
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,470
you can step into the boundaries of hell
with the present perfect. But, as I

50
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,160
said, if you're just beginning and the
present perfect really, really makes you

51
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:03,910
angry — forget about it. Just use the
simple past. An example of the present

52
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:11,110
perfect is: "I have eaten". Good for
you. I can also just say: "Yeah, I ate".

53
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,710
Uh-huh. It's the same idea. Nobody's
gonna be confused and go: "Oh, hold on.

54
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,950
That was the simple past." But it
doesn't matter. Just use the simple

55
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,030
past. Bye-bye present perfect. Toilet.
See ya.

56
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:32,110
Oh, this is a fun one: Reported speech.
Now, grammar textbooks love to teach you

57
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,490
the reported speech. And you gotta
change the grammar around and make sure

58
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,720
the time reflects in the day. (blows
tongue). Ronnie says: (blows tongue).

59
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:46,270
This is how we say these in normal
English. And if you don't believe me,

60
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,800
watch a video. Not only this one. Watch
a movie, listen to people speak, go on

61
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,700
all those social media things that
you're so addicted to, and listen to how

62
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:05,380
real people actually talk about
something that's reported. "She said

63
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:13,840
that she had eaten already" is reported
speech. Yeah, we don't say that. We use:

64
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:26,920
"went" and "goes". Let me show you how.
"She goes: 'I ate already'. Or: "He

65
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,980
went: 'Oh my god'". So, instead of
having to change all the grammar around

66
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,310
in the sentence, all you have to do is
put: "goes", instead of: "said"; and you

67
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,420
can also use "went". I can say: "She
went: 'I ate already'". It doesn't

68
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,170
matter. You can use: "went" and "goes".
Doesn't matter the grammar; it doesn't

69
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:51,910
matter the time. You don't have to
change anything. Reported speech,

70
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:58,270
bye-bye. If you're writing as a creative
writer, you can use reported speech, but

71
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,820
we never use it when we speak.

72
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:08,940
Next one. This is fun. Fuji, this for
you. "Who" in relative clauses. So,

73
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,520
you've learned in your textbook; it's
very proper grammar. Okay? "She is the

74
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,990
one who ate it." By the way, a "relative
clause" is giving more information about

75
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,230
the subject. So, I'm giving you more
information about the subject: "she".

76
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:31,260
So, the rule is: If it's a person, you
have to use: "who". You have to say:

77
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,760
"She's the one who ate it." Do you know
what? When we speak, we don't say that.

78
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,850
We just say: "that". Because in the
relative clause, without a human.  with

79
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:50,910
a person, we use: "that". I can say:
"Oh, this is the book that my great

80
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:57,570
grandmother gave me." I can say: "She is
the person that gave me the book." So,

81
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,460
when you're using relative clauses, even
if it's a person — ignore the grammar

82
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,830
rule. You don't need that rule. Rules
are (blows tongue).

83
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:18,070
Number seven. Number five. Number seven,
yes. Stative verbs. Yeah. Yeah, these

84
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,870
are fun. Right? So, you've learned about
stative verbs. "Stative verbs" are verbs

85
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:30,850
you cannot use with: "i–n–⁠g"⁠. Example:
"I'm having a car". No, that's wrong.

86
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,830
You can say: "I'm having a baby", but
you can't say: "I'm having a car". And

87
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:43,840
these are rules of stative verbs. You
must say: "I have a car". If you're

88
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:49,000
talking about possession — things that
you buy; not babies — you can say: "I

89
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:56,020
have a car", not: "I'm having a car".
But thanks to our modern society,

90
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,150
specifically, a restaurant that serves
millions and billions of people; has

91
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:12,970
some golden arches over there. Their
slogan is wrong. Their slogan is: "I'm

92
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,350
lovin' it". Hey, guess what? "Lovin'" or
"love" is a stative verb, but doesn't

93
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:26,830
matter. We don't care anymore. We say:
"Wow. I'm loving your new car."

94
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,190
Grammatically wrong, but that's how we
speak. You're in a restaurant, and the

95
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,600
waitress comes by and says: -"Hey. How
is everything?" -"Oh, I'm lovin' the

96
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,270
soup." That's not.  that's fine. Hey.
People at the table are like: "Oh, you

97
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,230
just used a stative verb wrong." Nobody
cares. We don't care about that; stative

98
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:53,680
verbs. The next one is, of course, the
opposite is: "hating". Okay? "Ah, I'm

99
00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:00,820
hating you right now. You've ruined my
life!" You can say that — that's fine.

100
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:10,300
We should say: "I hate you." But we have
to say: "I'm hating my new job. I.  Er.

101
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:18,640
It drives me crazy." And notice I don't
say: "hating"; I say: "hatin'". "I'm

102
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,360
lovin'"; "I'm hatin'". Sounds like a
country.

103
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,860
Another verb that we can use in this
stative form, but we're not supposed to

104
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,290
— don't tell my mom — is: "costing". So,
if you have to pay a lot of money for

105
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:41,640
something, you can say: "Wow. It's
costing me so much." Or you go into

106
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,490
someone's apartment, say: "Wow. How much
is this place costing you a month?"

107
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,990
Grammatically wrong. Feel free to point
that out to them, but it's how we change

108
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:59,610
language. So, I can say: "Well, this
must be costing you a pretty penny."

109
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,100
See? That one.  that idiom is so old.
We don't even have pennies anymore, so

110
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:11,670
come on. Come on. "Understanding".
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. "Oh, do you know what?

111
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:18,540
I'm not really understanding you." Oh.
Grammatically wrong, but: Hey, guess

112
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,610
what? We can say that. "I'm
understanding you now! Yeah!" Cool.

113
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,990
Again, your grammar teacher would faint
or roll over in his or her grave. But

114
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,180
guess what? Rule's off. You can say
that. So, I hope that you are

115
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:42,150
understanding all of this lesson, and
just be careful about grammar and all

116
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:46,350
these rules you have. Make sure that
what you're learning is actually

117
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:53,370
relevant and up to date, because the
last thing you want to do is sound like

118
00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:00,300
someone that came from the 1800s and is
hanging out, enjoying life. So, I'm

119
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,060
Ronnie; and grammar (blows tongue).
