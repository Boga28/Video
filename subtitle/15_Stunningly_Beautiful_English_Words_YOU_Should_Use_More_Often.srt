1
00:00:01,896 --> 00:00:04,479
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,460
- Welcome back to English with Lucy.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,460
Today I am going to teach you
15 beautiful English words

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,020
that I think you should use more often.

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,493
I think we should all use them more often.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,710
I've selected these words

7
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,820
because I find that they
roll off the tongue,

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,010
well, at least some of them do,

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,490
and others just have
really beautiful meanings.

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,980
To help you with your English
learning journey even more,

11
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,570
I have created a free PDF that
goes along with this lesson

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,070
and I have created a quiz.

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,180
I know you all love quizzes.

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,360
You always request quizzes.

15
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,300
If you would like to download
the free PDF and the quiz,

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,440
all you have to do is click on the link

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,820
in the description box.

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,540
You enter your name
and your email address.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,260
You sign up to my mailing list

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,080
and I send the PDF directly to your inbox.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,140
Before we get started,

22
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,220
I would just like to thank
the sponsor of today's video.

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,430
It is Lingoda, Europe's number
one trusted language school

24
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,630
with their language sprint.

25
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,930
With the sprint, you can learn
to speak English confidently

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,930
in just three months, gain
100% of your money back,

27
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,440
and gain free access to the
Cambridge online speaking test.

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,320
You just need to take
one of the 24/7 classes

29
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,490
every day for three months

30
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:37,880
and get your course fees
completely refunded.

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,060
Click on the link in the
description box to check the dates

32
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,260
for this sprint.

33
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,960
But be quick because if
the deadline has passed

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,080
or the spaces are filled,
you will miss out.

35
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,280
The super sprint offers a 100% refund

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,770
but there is also a lighter
regular sprint option

37
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,220
which offers a 50% refund.

38
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,530
You can join the sprint in
English, business English,

39
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:05,520
French, German and Spanish from
beginner to advanced level.

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,910
I'm really excited to share
this opportunity with you

41
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,700
because I have firsthand
experience of how amazing

42
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,550
and effective these
Lingoda challenges can be.

43
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,460
They've transformed so
many of my students' lives.

44
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,960
They love Lingoda
because they can interact

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,200
in intimate small group classes

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,200
with amazing qualified teachers
any time, any day, anywhere.

47
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,470
Over 40,000 people have participated

48
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,100
in the previous Lingoda
language challenges

49
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,680
with many of them becoming able

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,150
to overcome their fear of
speaking and get new jobs.

51
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,670
I actually joined one of
Lingoda student Facebook groups

52
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,360
and I was blown away by how many students

53
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,210
were celebrating their refunds

54
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,720
and their fluency transformations.

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,360
So how can you participate?

56
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,400
Sign up before the deadline

57
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,110
and pay the deposit to secure your spot.

58
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,112
You can use my code
CHANGE50 for 10 euros off.

59
00:03:04,112 --> 00:03:07,000
Lingoda will refund
your tuition fee in full

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,460
together with the deposit

61
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,410
if you attend the agreed number of classes

62
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:15,300
within each sprint month by
following the contest rules.

63
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,460
Remember, spaces in
the sprint are limited.

64
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,150
This is a language school
and places fill up.

65
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,850
So you have the link
in the description box.

66
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,900
You have my code CHANGE50
for 10 euros off.

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,810
What are you waiting for?

68
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,620
Let's get started with the lesson.

69
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,210
The first beautiful English word

70
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,120
that I think you should
use more frequently

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,770
is number one, appealing.

72
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,960
Appealing.

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,090
I love the long E sound.

74
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,020
This means attractive or interesting.

75
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:56,020
An example, his rich vocabulary
made him sound so appealing.

76
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,570
This is a word that my
mother uses quite a lot.

77
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,730
If she sees something delicious
or smells some nice food,

78
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,703
she'll always say, oh,
that looks so appealing.

79
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,060
It appeals to me.

80
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,640
It's appealing.

81
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,653
Number two is ineffable.

82
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,790
Ineffable.

83
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,790
This means too great or
beautiful to describe in words.

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,320
Something so wonderful

85
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,530
that you can't express
how wonderful it is.

86
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,160
It's ineffable.

87
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,400
An example.

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,480
When I heard of their pregnancy,

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,650
I was filled with ineffable joy.

90
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,030
Number three is nefarious.

91
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,550
Nefarious.

92
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,160
I know a lot of learners
of English struggle

93
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,830
with the /eə/ sound.

94
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,300
Now we are always taught
to pronounce it as /e/ /a/,

95
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,300
together, /eə/.

96
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,840
However, lots of my
students find it easier

97
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,505
to think of it as an
extension of an /e/ sound.

98
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:01,810
/a/ /a/.

99
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,660
Nefarious.

100
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,430
It might not be what you
find in a pronunciation book

101
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,370
but if it helps you,
then that's fine by me.

102
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,900
Now this might be a beautiful
word in my opinion, nefarious,

103
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,680
but it doesn't have a
very beautiful meaning.

104
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,760
It means criminal or extremely bad.

105
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,350
I like this word because
I find it very expressive.

106
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,470
An example.

107
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,080
They hacked into my bank account

108
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,760
and used the funds for nefarious purposes.

109
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,020
Criminal, extremely bad, extremely bad.

110
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,280
Number four is ethereal.

111
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,560
Ethereal.

112
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,130
This means extremely light and beautiful;

113
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,393
seeming to belong to another
more spiritual world.

114
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,350
I think the word sounds beautiful

115
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,830
but I think the meaning is amazing.

116
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,040
An example.

117
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,913
At sunrise, the London
skyline almost looks ethereal.

118
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,950
Number five, if you know me well,

119
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,500
then you might understand
why I love this word so much.

120
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,623
It is epiphany.

121
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,663
Epiphany.

122
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,520
Can you guess why I like it?

123
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,630
It means a sudden and surprising
moment of realisation.

124
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,460
I chose to name my pronunciation
course after this word,

125
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,530
Epiphany Language Studios.

126
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:32,860
This is because I want my
students to have an epiphany,

127
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,330
a moment of realisation and understanding

128
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,020
when it comes to their language skills

129
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,150
and their pronunciation.

130
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,350
An example.

131
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,100
When she took the course,

132
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,770
she had an epiphany and
everything became clear.

133
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,930
Number six, short, but sweet, angst.

134
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,180
Angst.

135
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,290
It's a feeling of great worry or concern

136
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,290
about your situation or your life.

137
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,840
You often hear teenage angst.

138
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,840
I wrote emotional poetry when
I was full of teenage angst.

139
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,390
Number seven is euphoria.

140
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,770
Euphoria.

141
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,770
This means an extremely
strong feeling of excitement

142
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,120
or happiness that usually
only lasts a short while.

143
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,460
An example.

144
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,890
After receiving the letter of acceptance,

145
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,613
I was in a state of euphoria.

146
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,120
Number eight is cherish.

147
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,620
Cherish.

148
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,520
This is a verb meaning to
love someone or something

149
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,890
very much and wanting
to protect them or it.

150
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,160
An example.

151
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,000
I will always cherish
the letter he wrote to me

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,260
before he moved away.

153
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,209
Number nine is eternity.

154
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,750
Eternity.

155
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,440
This simply means time without end.

156
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,440
For example, a mother's
love lasts for eternity.

157
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,920
Number 10 is quintessence.

158
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,660
Quintessence.

159
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,990
You may have heard it's
adjective form before,

160
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,980
quintessential, which
is also very beautiful,

161
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,320
but I think this one
is used less frequently

162
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,610
and I simply believe it should
be used more frequently.

163
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,880
It's a very good word, quintessence.

164
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,690
It means the perfect example of something.

165
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:31,890
An example.

166
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,309
It was the quintessence of
an English country cottage.

167
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:38,939
If you see a perfect country cottage

168
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,200
with beautiful light
stone and roses up it,

169
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,510
you can say that is the quintessence

170
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,620
of an English country cottage.

171
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,160
English country cottage.

172
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,480
That's a hard thing to say.

173
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
Try repeating that three times.

174
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,100
Number 11 is plethora.

175
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,950
Plethora.

176
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,950
This one does roll off
the tongue, plethora.

177
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,340
It means an amount that
is greater than is needed

178
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,030
or can be used.

179
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,100
For example.

180
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,150
The article contained a
plethora of information.

181
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:14,010
We're implying that there's
slightly too much information,

182
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,550
maybe in a good way,
just so much information

183
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,760
more than I could ever take
in, a plethora of information.

184
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,810
That might be one of my all
time favourites, actually,

185
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,400
or this next one.

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,700
Number 12, pristine.

187
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Pristine, oh, I love this word.

188
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
It's so expressive.

189
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,860
It means fresh and clean, as if new.

190
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,980
Her house was pristine.

191
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,390
It's another that my mother uses a lot.

192
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:49,310
Her house is always pristine,
and that is true of my mother.

193
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,020
You could eat off her floors.

194
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,720
Number 13 is surreptitiously.

195
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,620
Surreptitiously.

196
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,800
It means in a quick or secret way

197
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,870
so that people don't notice.

198
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,720
An example.

199
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,360
She surreptitiously slid
the check under his napkin.

200
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,920
Napkin is another word for serviette.

201
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,770
Number 14 is dulcet.

202
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,060
Dulcet.

203
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,410
This means sounding sweet or pleasant

204
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,420
and it's often paired with tones.

205
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,510
If you're talking about
somebody's dulcet tones,

206
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,870
it means their sweet voice.

207
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,110
An example, I can always
recognise her dulcet tones.

208
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,560
I can always recognise her lovely voice.

209
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,883
And number 15, the last one is docile.

210
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,720
Docile.

211
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,440
This means quiet and easy to control.

212
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,020
We often use it to talk about animals

213
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,100
that are very sweet natured.

214
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,370
An example.

215
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:54,870
The puppy is calm and incredibly docile,

216
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,161
said no puppy owner ever.

217
00:10:57,161 --> 00:10:58,730
(laughs)

218
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,220
My puppy was docile for the first week

219
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,560
and then it was chaos for nearly a year

220
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,030
and now he's completely
docile again, not completely.

221
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,190
Right, that's it for today's lesson.

222
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,430
I hope you enjoyed it and I
hope you learned something.

223
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,200

Also, I've still got a
few things to figure out

229
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,830
but quite a few of you mentioned

230
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,440
that my white background
makes your eyes feel tired.

231
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,873
So, I had a brainwave, black background.

232
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,860
Do you like it?

233
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,160
What's your feedback?

234
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,810
Step by step I am trying

235
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,960
to make these lessons better for you.

236
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,153
New microphone, black background,
PDFs with every lesson.

237
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,170
I hope it works for you.

238
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,670
I always listen to your feedback.

239
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,520

240
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,220

241
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,960

then you can have a look
at my vlogging channel

249
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,310
where I've logged my life here

250
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,770
in the English countryside on a farm.

251
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,270

I will see you soon for another lesson.

258
00:12:42,135 --> 00:12:43,111
(blows kisses)

259
00:12:43,111 --> 00:12:45,694
(upbeat music)
