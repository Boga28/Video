00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:08,039
Hello everyone. And welcome back to English
with Lucy. Today I have a very special guest.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,320
This is my fiance, William.
Hello everyone.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,120
Will has never been on this channel before.
No.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,770
So it's an honour.
It's been long overdue.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:27,480
It has. So I've seen that many of you have
requested a video on daily routines. So I

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,899
thought it would be a good idea for us to
have a conversation and tell you about our

7
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:41,129
daily routines. And then I'll pick out some
vocabulary to show you. So this is a fantastic

8
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:48,530
listening lesson, pronunciation lesson, because
you can see how we pronounce specific words.

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:55,350
Don't forget to switch on subtitles if you
need them. And to make this even better, I've

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:02,961
created a PDF sheet for you, which contains
all of the key vocabulary. All you have to

11
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:08,570
do to download that is click on the link in
the description box and sign up to my mailing

12
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,710
list. It will be sent directly to your inbox.
Also, don't forget to share your own daily

13
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:21,190
routine in the comment section down below.
I'd love to know what time you wake up, what

14
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,990
you eat for breakfast, what you have for lunch,
what you have for dinner, and also what time

15
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:31,799
you go to bed. So first I think we should
introduce ourselves because although we are

16
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,780
getting married, we live quite different lives,
don't we?

17
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,180
Couldn't be more different really.
Yeah. So we live in the same house, but we

18
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:47,950
have very different jobs. I am an English
teacher, but I work on YouTube.

19
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:54,789
And I am a farmer and I work mainly outdoors
on the farm.

20
00:01:54,789 --> 00:02:01,740
Yes. So quite the unique pair I think. My
first question for you is what time do you

21
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:10,720
usually wake up?
Usually I would wake up at 5:30 to 6:00.

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:19,970
Yes, but what time do you get up?
But I get up at 6:00.

23
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:26,250
Yeah. So there's an important difference between
wake up and get up. When your eyes open in

24
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:33,030
the morning, you wake up. But when you leave
your bed in the morning, you get up and Will

25
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,660
has a big problem. This gap between waking
up and getting up is getting bigger and bigger.

26
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,630
Isn't it?
I've gone from setting one alarm to three

27
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,950
alarms.
Three alarms, and I have to lay next to him

28
00:02:48,950 --> 00:03:01,150
hearing each alarm. So I have a very different
job. I, well, I wake up at 5:30, at 5:45 at

29
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:11,500
6:00 with Will. But I keep on sleeping and
I get up at 7:30. But something very important

30
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:19,900
happens between that time frame I think.
I feed the pets and I bring up a couple of

31
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,680
coffees.
Yes. So very important. In the morning when

32
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,760
Will gets up before he goes to work, he brings
me a coffee in bed and we try to have a coffee

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,230
together. It's a nice routine to have, I think.
Yeah. It's a good start to the day.

34
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:42,750
Yeah. But it's interesting because Will's
job isn't the same all year round. In summer

35
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,600
you're really, really busy. I mean, what time
do you wake up in the summer?

36
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:53,850
4:30 normally.
Really, really early. So in the UK, we have

37
00:03:53,850 --> 00:04:00,470
very long days in the summer and very short
days in the winter. If you're from Norway,

38
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,930
Sweden, or anywhere more up North, you'll
think, "What are you complaining about?" But

39
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:11,660
I remember when I was teaching English in
Spain, people were surprised that the sun

40
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:19,790
would rise at 4:30 in the morning in summer
and then set at 10:00 at night. But then in

41
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:27,130
the winter, the sun doesn't come up till 9:00
and then it can set at 3:30. So it's a big

42
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,820
difference. So your days in summer are so
much longer.

43
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,350
Yeah.
So let's move on to having breakfast. I normally

44
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:40,870
have breakfast at around 8:00. When do you
have yours?

45
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:49,040
Either 7:30, before I go out to work again
or at 10:00.

46
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,700
Oh yes. Because you go out and come back in
for a break.

47
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,970
Yeas.
Yeah. And what do you usually have?

48
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:05,780
Normally I would eat a bowl of cereal or I'd
have a plate of toast.

49
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,170
Toast. Yes. Or on a special occasion, bacon
sandwiches.

50
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,900
Very special.
Bacon sandwiches on special occasions, or

51
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,030
what about a full English breakfast?
Only on weekends.

52
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:28,640
Yes. So this is a really famous breakfast
in the UK. The full English where you have

53
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:34,420
eggs, sausages, bacon.
Black pudding.

54
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,150
Black pudding. What's black pudding? I don't
think some of my students will like it.

55
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,710
You don't need to know then.
It's sausage made out of blood. Black pudding,

56
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,410
hash brown.
Hash browns.

57
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,320
It's like fried potato. Baked beans.
French toast.

58
00:05:51,320 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah. Toast fried in oil. And we often have
a cooked tomato and cooked mushrooms as well.

59
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,990
So it's a huge breakfast, very high fat. And
we normally have it if we have drunk alcohol

60
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,180
the night before.
Yes.

61
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:18,210
So it's something you'd have if you are hung
over. You can have a hangover or you can be

62
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,310
hung over. This is important. They need to
know it. Because I think they see the English

63
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,690
breakfast sometimes and think that, that's
what we eat every morning. And that's not

64
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,780
true.
No.

65
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,590
You have to be really hungry for an English
breakfast.

66
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,340
We don't.
No. We don't eat every morning. I would say

67
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:39,180
maybe five times a year.
Yeah. Not a lot.

68
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,400
Five times a year. If we go to a hotel full
English. Sometimes we compress it down to

69
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:53,050
a flinglish. Can I have a flinglish. So for
my breakfast, I nearly always have it at around

70
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:01,610
8:00 and I normally have porridge. So that's
oats and milk cooked with some fruit like

71
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,880
banana, nectarines, or plums at the moment.
And in summer I use blueberries and bananas.

72
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,460
Delicious.
So the next thing that I do after breakfast

73
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:18,861
is I do some exercise. In American English,
it's more common to say I work out. And we

74
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:26,180
do say this, but it's not as commonly used
in British English. I do a workout. Yes. But

75
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,780
I work out. I mean, would you think it's more
American?

76
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:35,290
Yes, definitely.
Yeah. So I either go to the gym and do an

77
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:43,510
exercise class or I stay on the farm and I
go for a run. I go for a run. If you do exercise,

78
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:50,160
what do you do?
I do a lot of walking all day. So 80% of my

79
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:59,380
day will be walking. And we have a Fitbit
that tracks every step we take, every move

80
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:11,020
we make. And that tracks our steps every day.
Yeah. And we have a competition. So you can

81
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:17,330
see all the steps that our friends and family
have done. And if Will remembers to wear his

82
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:24,030
Fitbit, he always wins. It's so annoying.
I run 10 kilometres and I still don't beat

83
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:31,080
Will because you just spend all day walking.
So all day, nearly every day I will be lifting

84
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,429
bags, shovelling grain, just a lot of physical
work really.

85
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,128
Yeah. So you said shovelling.
Yes. Shovelling.

86
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:45,009
So that's to use a shovel or a spade. It's
the verb of using that. I think that was a

87
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:52,240
good one. And grain. Grain is basically seeds
like wheat, barley, oats, and a thing like

88
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,570
that. That's what Will grows on his farm.
So Will also does some work in a little gym

89
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,279
that we have set up. We have put in place
downstairs and I see you do lots of-

90
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,319
Bicep curls.
Bicep curls. Squats.

91
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:12,470
Squats.
I do some squats at the gym sometimes.

92
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,629
Yes.
And bench presses as well.

93
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:18,029
Yes. Bench press.
Those are the three that I really see you

94
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,350
do.
Yep.

95
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,290
Yeah. Anything else?
What else? Press ups.

96
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:28,869
Press ups. When you're down going like that.
And some chin ups.

97
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:33,060
Oh yes. When you pull your body up like that.
Yeah.

98
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,259
I hope you enjoyed my demonstration of that.
I won't be starting a fitness channel. One

99
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:47,210
thing that takes a lot of time for me is doing
my makeup and doing my hair. It's a long process.

100
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:53,180
I'm exactly the same. Exactly the same. Why
else do you think I get up at 4:30 in the

101
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,670
morning?
You got to look good for those fields. I also

102
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:05,290
spend a long time writing scripts and doing
a lot of researching because I'm always learning

103
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:12,379
as well. So I have an idea for an English
lesson in my head, and then I'll spend a full

104
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:19,170
day researching and writing the scripts for
the next day's filming. So on a Monday, I'll

105
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:25,681
do the research and the writing. On a Tuesday,
I'll do the filming. On a Wednesday, we'll

106
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:30,779
get all the editing done. And then on the
Thursdays and Fridays, I'll do more admin

107
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:39,269
work. So looking at my accounts, the finances,
replying to emails, sending emails. It's a

108
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:42,350
full time job.
Yeah.

109
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,610
It's a full time job.
It is.

110
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,790
Will has a very specific lunchtime. What time
is it?

111
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,970
1:00.
1:00 is lunch time. It has to be lunch time

112
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,990
because that's when Will's dad has lunch as
well. And you work with your dad.

113
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,970
Yeah.
Yeah. So at 1:00 every day we come in and

114
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,050
we have lunch and we both have different lunches,
don't we?

115
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,069
Yes.
Yeah. We hardly ever eat the same thing.

116
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:16,660
Yes. I normally have a sandwich.
In the winter I always have soup. I love having

117
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:23,290
something warm for lunch because I'm quite
a cold person. I get cold very easily. And

118
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:30,440
in the summer I nearly always have salad,
but not boring salad. I like to make interesting

119
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,600
salads with different seeds. I like to use
butternut squash.

120
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,059
Yep.
Yep. So that's similar to pumpkin. Some cheese

121
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:49,009
like feta cheese or mozzarella. And I try
to include a bit of protein like chicken or

122
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:58,249
fish as well. In the UK we to have a light
lunch and a heavy dinner. I know this is different

123
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:04,059
in some countries and cultures. I remember
when I lived in Spain, we would have a big

124
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:09,809
lunch and then a lighter dinner. And this
was really hard for me especially as the dinner

125
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:16,589
time was so late. Whereas in England we eat
dinner quite early.

126
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:20,769
But before we talk about dinner, what do we
do in the afternoons? When I know one thing

127
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:28,119
that I often do is I walk the dog. I love
taking our dog Diego on a long walk across

128
00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:30,980
all the fields. And I think he loves that
too.

129
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,470
Yes he does.
He loves it. Okay. Let's talk about dinner

130
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:42,160
time. Here we normally have dinner at around
6:00. Although sometimes in the summer we'll

131
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,689
have it later. Maximum 8:00, right?
Yeah, latest.

132
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:51,269
Yeah, latest 8:00. And what do we typically
have for dinner?

133
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:56,499
Our meals are quite varied. We normally eat
fish twice a week.

134
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:03,470
Yes. So one of my favourite dishes is to cook
salmon with lemon, asparagus and potatoes.

135
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,239
We have that every single week. Don't we?
Yes, we do.

136
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:11,759
And then we have other fish like tuna, sea
bass.

137
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,029
Sea bream.
Sea bream. Haddock?

138
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:22,339
Sometimes yes.
Basa as well. I love Basa. We do eat a lot

139
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:28,250
of fish, two or three times a week. One of
Will's favourites is steak. So I do that every

140
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,769
now and again. We do it on the barbecue.
Yap.

141
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:38,379
And we also like doing chicken and salads
inspired by the Italians. We do a lot of prawn

142
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:46,730
linguini with lemon and sun dried tomatoes.
That's delicious. And then on a Sunday we

143
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:55,999
often have a very traditional British meal.
The Sunday roast. Sometimes I make it myself

144
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,769
and sometimes we go.  Well more often we
go to the pub.

145
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:03,629
I think more often we go to the pub.
Definitely. Definitely. I love going out on

146
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:10,879
a Sunday afternoon for a Sunday roast.
A Sunday roast is made up of one meat.

147
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:18,730
Yeah. So typically turkey, chicken, lamb,
pork, or beef.

148
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:25,779
Yes. One side of potatoes.
Roast potatoes. So roast potatoes are very

149
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:32,610
special. You peel them, you boil them. Then
you cover them in fat, like an oil or sometimes

150
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,529
duck fat or goose fat. And then you put them
in the oven and cook them until they're golden

151
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:42,179
and crispy. They are so good.
They are delicious.

152
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:47,620
They're amazing. And every British person
thinks that their parents, their moms or their

153
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:56,389
grandma's Sunday roast potatoes are the best.
And then vegetables, you'll have two to three

154
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:01,709
or more.
Could be more. Your mom does four different

155
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:04,319
vegetables.
She loves it.

156
00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:09,660
She does such a good roast.
Okay. Let's say for different types of vegetables

157
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:17,350
will be on your plate as well. That would
be broccoli, cabbage, peas, beans, carrots.

158
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,040
Carrots, parsnips.
Parsnips. Yes.

159
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:29,709
That's the one vegetable that I.  I will
eat it. There's nothing I won't eat, but parsnips,

160
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:35,259
I would not choose to have them. They're too
sweet for me. But often with chicken or with

161
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:42,579
turkey, because they're birds, they have stuffing,
which is.  What is stuffing?

162
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:48,269
Stuffing is made up of chopped nuts.
Onion.

163
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:50,389
Onion.
Flour.

164
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:56,879
And some herbs and they're all blended together
and made into a bowl.

165
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:57,879
Yeah.
Really.

166
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:06,119
And it's quite doughy. He's quite heavy. And
then we also have Yorkshire puddings, which

167
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:13,980
is like a big.  It's like a big fluffy pancake
almost. The mixture is the same as pancake

168
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,670
mixture, but it's very light and airy. It
starts off with this size and it grows and

169
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:23,429
grows. And if I have one, I always give it
to Will because it's just too much food for

170
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,569
me.
And Will accepts.

171
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:29,939
He does. And then the best bit is the gravy,
which is a meat sauce made from the juices

172
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:35,629
of the meat and you pour that all over and
it's absolutely delicious. Let's move on to

173
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:43,309
the end of the day. What about baths or showers?
Because I prefer a bath, but if I have to

174
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:49,120
wash my hair, then I'll have a shower. And
I normally have it in the morning so that

175
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,009
my hair can be clean for the rest of the day.
When do you have yours?

176
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:59,660
So every night before I go to bed, about 9:30
to 10:00. I have a shower.

177
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:05,319
Yeah, just before bed.
I never have a bath. I can't fit in baths.

178
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:13,148
So Will is six foot six or 1.98 metres tall,
nearly two metres. So baths are often not

179
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:17,788
an option. What time do you normally go to
bed?

180
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:28,289
I normally go to bed between 10:00 and 10:30.
Yes. So we go to bed quite early, but obviously

181
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:34,149
it's because we wake up quite early as well.
Will wakes up very early. But after Will wakes

182
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:39,540
up in the morning, I find it hard to go back
to sleep. So I also go to bed between 10:00

183
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,580
and 10:30. We would like to know what time
you wake up and what time you go to bed and

184
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:51,490
any other information of what you do and at
what time in your own daily routine. Please

185
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,769
write it down below in the comments section.
Right. So that's it for today's lesson. I

186
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:01,200
hope you enjoyed it. And I hope you learned
something and don't forget to download that
