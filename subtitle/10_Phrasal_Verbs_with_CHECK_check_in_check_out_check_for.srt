1
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:04,759
And I'm back with the torture of phrasal verbs.

2
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:11,119
I know everyone hates phrasal verbs; I hate
them, too, because there're so many of them.

3
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:15,320
They're confusing, but cool; I'm going to
teach them to you.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,520
My name's Ronnie, and I am going to make you
check out this lesson.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,140
So, today's lesson is phrasal verbs of "check".

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,270
So, we have, first of all, the construction
of a phrasal verb.

7
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:40,699
A phrasal verb is a verb with a preposition,
or two prepositions just to make it fancy.

8
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:48,469
A preposition you think of as placement; up,
out, in, for, off, into, blah, blah, blah.

9
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:58,309
So, these are what make English very confusing,
and people look at the sky, like: "Check up.

10
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,800
Why am I up?

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
No.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Down.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,800
No."

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
So, if you...

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,720
For example, if you "check up on someone",
this means that you want to make sure that

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,420
they are okay or that they're not doing something
bad.

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:22,220
So, you will hear this a lot in movies where
the teenager will say: "Mom, are you checking

18
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:23,530
up on me"?

19
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:33,560
"Mom, are you checking up on me?" this means
someone is concerned about what you are doing.

20
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,110
Like I said, maybe you're doing something
bad or maybe you're sick, so someone will

21
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,460
come check up on you to make sure you are
okay.

22
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:48,470
So, we have two meanings; one's good, one's
bad.

23
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,140
If you "check out"...

24
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:56,140
You maybe have heard this in a hotel; you
might see: "Check-out time".

25
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,350
But, as a phrasal verb, "check out" means
you physically leave the hotel.

26
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:06,521
Also, if you go shopping and you're ready
to pay for something, you can check out, which

27
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,600
means you pay at a store.

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,300
In a supermarket, there's a check-out...

29
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,500
Check-out, girl.

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,840
There's a sort of check-out area; that's a
noun.

31
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,240
So: "I'm going to check out" we can also use.

32
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,610
The opposite for "check out" is "check in".

33
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,510
So, when you enter the hotel, you're going
to confirm a reservation.

34
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,980
Also, if you're going on an airplane-I want
to go on an airplane-you go to the counter

35
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:41,780
and you check in, so you confirm your reservation
on an airplane, or you confirm or you get

36
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,730
a hotel room.

37
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:50,750
If you "check for something", you're going
to search or you're going to examine something

38
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,430
for...

39
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,180
To make sure it's there or not there.

40
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,990
A common problem we have with children around
the world...

41
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,400
I remember when I was in elementary school,
we all had to get checked for lice.

42
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,590
Lice are little bugs that live in people's
hair.

43
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,569
So, we had to get checked, so: "We checked
for lice."

44
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,820
So, the nurse came in and looked at everyone's
head, made sure you had no bugs roaming around.

45
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,120
I didn't have lice.

46
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Yes.

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
Cool.

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,800
Have you ever had lice?

49
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,234
It's cool; you just get some shampoo; everything's
good.

50
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:29,234
Don't tell anyone.

51
00:03:29,234 --> 00:03:30,234
It's kind of...

52
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:33,380
Maybe you won't have any friends if you have
lice.

53
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,330
So, we checked for lice.

54
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:39,380
"Check off" is, like, a checkmark.

55
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,790
So, a checkmark is this, and you check something
off a list.

56
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,459
So, you can make...

57
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:51,319
For example: "I checked off another point
on my list."

58
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,879
Maybe you have a bucket list.

59
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,510
A bucket list are...

60
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,819
Is a list of things you would like to do,
like: "I want to skydive."

61
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,770
So, you skydive, you come back, and you...

62
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,842
You check off skydiving on your list.

63
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:10,280
Have you gone skydiving before?

64
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,980
I haven't.

65
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,530
I'd like to.

66
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,810
We can also "check into"-which is different
from "check in"-a hospital.

67
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,450
Now, I know what you're thinking.

68
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:27,800
You're thinking: "Ronnie, why do we check
in on an airplane, but we check into a hospital?"

69
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,990
I don't know.

70
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,990
Okay?

71
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:34,680
I didn't make these stupid phrasal verbs;
I'm just teaching them to you, so I don't

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,680
know.

73
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,350
Maybe get in your time machine, go back in
time and change it, or ask someone in your

74
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,410
magical time machine, because I don't know.

75
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,600
But you check into a hotel.

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,530
As an example, if you use the future: "We
will check him into the hospital."

77
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,600
Not hotel.

78
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,220
It's certainly not a hotel.

79
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:07,000
If you check your luggage through, this sometimes
can be a little bit troublesome because this

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,070
is how luggage gets lost most of the time.

81
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:18,290
So, imagine you are flying from destination
A, then you have a stopover in destination

82
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:25,030
B, and your final destination is C. So, the
airline company says: "Guess what?

83
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:32,280
We will check your luggage through to your
final destination of C." Yay.

84
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:40,290
So, you go on your merry way, you go to your
transfer point in B, and by the time you get

85
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:46,910
to your final destination at point C, you're
waiting for your luggage.

86
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,820
Oh, no, you're the last person.

87
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,660
There's no luggage.

88
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,920
Where's your luggage?

89
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,050
So, you go to the counter and you say: "Hey.

90
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:03,500
My luggage was checked through to San Francisco."

91
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,060
And the airline company goes: "Well, it's
not here."

92
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,060
Oh, yeah.

93
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,060
Bye-bye; it's lost.

94
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,050
So, losing luggage is not a good thing, but
they can tell you: "We will check it through."

95
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:21,020
So, this means they pretend they will send
your luggage to your final destination.

96
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,090
Good luck, luggage.

97
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,960
It's a big tour.

98
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,210
We can also say "check with".

99
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,670
So, maybe you ask someone: "Hey, hey.

100
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,540
I have this great idea.

101
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,009
Let's do it."

102
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:40,650
And the person says: -"Nah, I got to check
with Bob."

103
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,590
-"Who's Bob?

104
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,280
Let's do it."

105
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,280
-"No."

106
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,600
So, if you "check with someone", you're going
to confirm something.

107
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,820
You're going to confirm information or you're
going to confirm that something is okay to

108
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
do.

109
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,009
I don't like this.

110
00:06:58,009 --> 00:06:59,009
It's important, though.

111
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:01,290
You're going to check with someone.

112
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,900
We have another phrase that we use in slang
all the time.

113
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,320
People will say: -"Hey, check it out!"

114
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
-"Check...

115
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
Check...

116
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Check what out?

117
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
What?

118
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
What are you talking about: Check?

119
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,320
I can't check anything."

120
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
-"Check it out".

121
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,509
"Check it out" means: "Hey, go look at something
over there."

122
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:20,550
Or...

123
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,630
Bless me.

124
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,650
"Go examine it."

125
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,050
If you say: "Hey.

126
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,990
Check out my new video."

127
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,289
That means: "Hey.

128
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,370
Look at my new video."

129
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:36,430
We have another expression: "check him/her
out".

130
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,210
This basically just means: Look at her.

131
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:45,590
You will see some people, maybe at the mall,
and they're watching people, and they go:

132
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,030
"Hey, check her out."

133
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,370
Or: "Hey, check him out."

134
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,680
This can be positive or negative.

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,110
Maybe someone is very strange looking or it's
me, and people go: "Hey, check her out.

136
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,720
What's she doing?

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,270
That's weird."

138
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,880
So that can be a good thing or a bad thing.

139
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,669
Another good thing or a bad thing, depending
on who's doing it: If someone is checking

140
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:10,669
you out.

141
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:13,650
Okay, you're not shopping at the mall.

142
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:21,610
If he's checking you out or she's checking
you out, he or she is looking at your body.

143
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,960
Excuse me?

144
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Or they're...

145
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,410
They're checking you out to see if they like
you.

146
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:32,169
So, maybe you go to a bar or you go to a restaurant,
or you go somewhere, and you see someone looking

147
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,169
at you.

148
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,169
"Huh?

149
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,169
Huh?

150
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:36,169
Huh?"

151
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,169
And they wink.

152
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,169
"Do you have something in your eye?

153
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,169
No, okay."

154
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:46,710
This person is checking you out; they're looking
at you to see if they like you.

155
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,590
I'm checking you out right now.

156
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:51,870
Oh, that was creepy, Ronnie; don't do that.

157
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,830
So, you have to check out more lessons on
www.engvid.com.

158
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,000
Check out and subscribe to my YouTube channel.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,260
And I'm checking out of this crazy hotel called
this lesson.

160
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,700
Bye-bye.
