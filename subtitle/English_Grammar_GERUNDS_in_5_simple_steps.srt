Hi! Welcome to today's lesson: Understand
Gerunds in five simple steps. I'm Arnel

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,320
from Arnel's
Everyday English and today you are going

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:33,780
to learn how to use gerunds. Let me give
you three sentences: Drinking water is

4
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:46,559
healthy. I am drinking water. Is this
drinking water? You can see in three

5
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:55,530
sentences we have drinking, but, only one
of them is a gerund. Number one, drinking

6
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,530
water is healthy. Drinking is a gerund.
Number two,

7
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,710
present continuous. Number three, drinking
water is a noun, and drinking is the

8
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,820
adjective that describes drinking water.
Let's take a look

9
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:28,140
why number one is the gerund. What is a
gerund? Swimming, dancing, playing, doing,

10
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:40,350
feeling, closing, trying, typing, looking,
calling, crying, standing, falling, eating.  I

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:47,939
think you get the idea.
A gerund is the infinitive + i n g. They

12
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:55,290
look like verbs, but they function as a
noun. We use gerunds when we want to

13
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:09,360
focus on the general idea of an activity,
not the specific action. Swimming is good

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,310
for your body.
Swimming is my gerund,

15
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,280
it is the subject of my sentence. We're
looking at swimming as a general

16
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:32,000
activity. To swim is good for your body?
Swim is good for your body.  Eating too

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,700
much sugar is bad for your teeth.
Eating is my gerund, it is the subject of

18
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:46,000
the sentence. To eat too much sugar is
bad for your teeth? Eat too much sugar? No.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,209
Here's a tip, if you want to begin your
sentence with a verb use a gerund. Of

20
00:02:55,209 --> 00:03:03,080
course there are exceptions. For example
with imperatives, use the infinitive. Close

21
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:14,300
the door. Sit down. We wouldn't say:
Closing the door, sitting down. We spoke

22
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:23,660
about the grammar of a gerund and using
gerunds as a noun. So, number two: We use

23
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:32,299
gerunds after the verb BE when we speak
about an activity. The best part of a

24
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:43,280
meal is eating dessert. I have my BE: is.
And my gerund: eating dessert. The thing I

25
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:54,829
love most about Sunday's is sleeping. Is
+ my gerund. Don't forget a gerund

26
00:03:54,829 --> 00:04:03,290
functions as a noun. So I could say the
best part of a meal is dessert. Dessert

27
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:10,390
is also a noun. Eating, I'm really
focusing on that action.

28
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:22,010
Don't confuse gerunds and continuous
tenses. The best part of a meal is eating

29
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,460
dessert.
My dog is eating my dessert!

30
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:34,700
The first one is a gerund, the second one
is the present continuous. Step number

31
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,520
three is very important.
Unfortunately for number three there

32
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:49,360
isn't a specific rule. Well, the rule is
you need to memorize! Gerunds follow

33
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,070
specific verbs. For example: I avoid
eating too much sugar.

34
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:11,060
After avoid use a gerund. I avoid to eat?
I avoid eat? We've deferred signing the

35
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:19,700
contract until our solicitor has taken a
look at the contract. All these verbs are

36
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:28,190
followed by a gerund because that's the
grammatical rule. So, how do I know which

37
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:35,419
verbs are followed by a gerund? I have a
list for you! What you can do is click

38
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:41,840
the link below, I'm going to give you a
link to my website. There you'll find a

39
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,080
list of the most important verbs you
need to know which are all followed by a

40
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:59,390
gerund. Use gerunds after a preposition.
What are prepositions? In, on, at, above,

41
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:09,590
under, through, to, four, of.  I think you get
the idea.

42
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:19,910
Use a gerund after a preposition. I'm
good at making brownies. I'm good at make?

43
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:29,099
I'm good at to make? I'm interested
in booking an English course. I went to

44
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:39,710
work in spite of feeling sick.
In spite of feeling sick. Preposition,

45
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:48,569
gerund. You know what? That's it, you've
done a fantastic job! What I'd like you

46
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:55,469
to do: In the comments below leave me an
example sentence with a gerund. Make sure

47
00:06:55,469 --> 00:07:03,389
it's not a present past continuous
example and it's not an adjective.

48
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,180
Give me an example sentence with a
gerund.
