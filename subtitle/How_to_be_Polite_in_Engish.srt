1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,240
I don't know about you, but I
don't like it when people are rude.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,680
Politeness is generally
very important,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,000
especially if you want people
to help you with something.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,320
If you want someone to do something
for you, there are different ways of

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,080
expressing it in English, depending
on how polite you want to be.

6
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,360
If I say:

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,120
"Open the window!"

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,840
 
it's quite direct, isn't it?

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,720
It's the imperative form,
which is more or less an order.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,120
"Open the window, please!"

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,840
Adding the word 'please'
does make it more polite,

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,640
but it's still quite direct.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,080
 
"Can you open the window, please?"

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,840
Now we are getting more
polite, but why is this more polite?

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,680
Well, one reason is because
this is now a question.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,800
So it's more of a
request than an order.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,080
And because it's a question,
it's easier to say no.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,880
Let's now use could instead of can.

19
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,480
"Could you open the window,
please?"

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,800
Could is more polite than can

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,240
and this is where
it begins to get interesting.

22
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,000
Why is:

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,240
'Could you open the window, please?'

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,360
more polite than:

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,240
'Can you open the window, please?'

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:24,160
Well,
it's all to do with the relationship

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,000
between can and could and the
idea of distance, of remoteness.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,200
'Could' can be described as
the remote form of 'can'.

29
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,640
Sometimes that distance is time.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,880
"I can swim."

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,320
That's an ability
I have now.

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,960
"I could swim when I was four."

33
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,280
That's an ability
I had at a time in the past.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,880
Sometimes that distance is between
what is real and what is imagined.

35
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,120
"I can't do that in my head."

36
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,120
 
This is something that is not
possible for me to do now.

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,000
"I couldn't do that
even if I had a calculator."

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,640
This is something
that's not possible for me to do,

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,320
even in an imagined situation
where I have a calculator.

40
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,360
And sometimes distance
is in relationship.

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,640
"Can you open the window, please?"

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,920
 
"Could you open the window, please?"

43
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,760
Could puts more social distance
between speaker and listener.

44
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,480
That makes it more polite as it's less
uncomfortable for someone to say no.

45
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,120
Now, we're not talking
about actual distance here.

46
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,560
We're not saying you have to be
physically further away to be polite,

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,600
but it is a good way to visualise it.
The further the speaker is away,

48
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,240
the easier it is to say no and
'could' puts you further away.

49
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,520
Open the window!

50
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,920
 
Open the window, please!

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,360
Can you open the window, please?

52
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,800
Could you open the window, please?

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,600
And in English, we can make
that distance even further too

54
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,560
using past forms
and modal structures.

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,800
I was wondering if you wouldn't
mind opening the window

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,280
if it's not too much trouble.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,760
For a simple request
like opening a window,

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,760
that one is probably
a bit over the top.

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,800
One very important thing to remember,
perhaps more important

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,560
than the words themselves,
is the way they are spoken.

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,240
It's only polite if the
tone of voice is polite.

62
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,640
You can make a polite
form of words less polite

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,000
if you stress it in
a different way. For example:

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,520
"Can you open the window?"

65
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,720
"Could you please open the window?"

66
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,240
So sounding polite is a combination
of words and the way you say them

67
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,000
and when it comes to words,

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,200
'could you' is more polite than 'can you'

69
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,000
and longer phrases with past forms
and modals are more polite still.
