Hello, everyone, and welcome back to English
with Lucy. Today, I am going to talk to you

2
00:00:15,969 --> 00:00:22,200
about my five tips for achieving fluency in
English. I know this is a topic that lots

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,980
of you are interested in. It does depend on
what fluency means to you. Different people

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,570
will feel fluent at different stages. So you've
got to define that for yourself, but I'm going

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:38,150
to offer you my advice today and, hopefully,
it will be a learning experience in itself.

6
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,070
I've created a free PDF that goes along with
this lesson. It's got the full transcript

7
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,550
plus key vocabulary that I have used throughout
the lesson. If you'd like to download that,

8
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,430
click on the link in the description box,
you enter your name and your email address,

9
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:57,890
you sign up to my email list, I send the PDF
directly to your inbox, and then from this

10
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:03,039
week onwards, you automatically will receive
my lesson PDFs for free. It's a free service

11
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,830
along with all of my information, offers and
course updates. Let's get started with the

12
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,830
lesson.

13
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:15,840
My first tip is possibly the most important
one. It is do not expect miracles. There are

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,141
a lot of products out there at the moment
that promote becoming fluent in 30 days. I

15
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:29,110
even saw a video the other day promising fluency
in a week. You've got to be realistic. Before

16
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,530
you do anything else, before you progress
with your fluency journey, get that idea out

17
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,020
of your head. Fluency is a marathon, not a
sprint. It's absolutely fine to sprint towards

18
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,200
certain goals, but make sure they are achievable
goals. Otherwise, you're just setting yourself

19
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,709
up for failure. Having learned two foreign
languages myself, I can understand completely

20
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:55,210
how frustrating it is and how much pressure
there is to get to a certain level quickly

21
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,069
or to pass a certain exam before a certain
date. Not everyone out there is a language

22
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:05,210
genius. Try and understand your own abilities
and your own pace of learning and set realistic

23
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,210
goals around that.

24
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,660
I ended up learning Spanish really quickly
because I had the golden opportunity of going

25
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,069
over there and living with a Spanish family
and having a Spanish partner. When I went

26
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:22,431
to learn Italian afterwards I was disappointed
because I learnt it much more slowly and I

27
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:27,560
didn't find it easy to get to a high level.
I had to realise it's not me. It's my situation.

28
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,040
So I set realistic goals around it and I ended
up doing really well in my Italian modules

29
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,560
at university.

30
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,489
Tip number two is learn efficiently and this
tip comes as thanks to the sponsor of today's

31
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:44,960
video, Lingoda. Now, whenever I speak to somebody
who is picking up a new language, I always

32
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,200
hear them say, "Yeah, I've downloaded loads
of language apps. It's going really well,"

33
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,250
but they never seem to carry it on that far.
I think that language apps are a great way

34
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,719
of passing your time and picking up certain
things and making a small amount of progress.

35
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:06,129
But I do not think that they are anywhere
near the most efficient way of achieving fluency

36
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:07,129
in a language.

37
00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:12,170
This is where Lingoda comes in. They are an
online language school and they teach English,

38
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:19,310
business English, French, German, and Spanish.
They provide live online classes with amazing

39
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,480
qualified teachers in intimate little groups
so you get lots of attention and lots of feedback

40
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,060
and prices start at just â‚¬8 per 60-minute
small group class. The lessons are available

41
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,659
24/7 so you can always fit them around your
busy work schedule or your personal life.

42
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,120
Fairly often, I check into the Lingoda platform
and attend some classes just to keep up to

43
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,959
date with the school and see how everything's
going and I always have so much fun. Their

44
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,751
class booking tool is so simple to use and
the learning materials are amazing and you

45
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:59,170
have access to them all. You can use all of
them at any time and that is an insane resource.

46
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:05,109
If you want to boost your fluency with regular
structured classes then Lingoda for yourself.

47
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:09,310
Check out their monthly subscription because
they've got some amazing package deals. You

48
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,389
can sign up for a seven-day free trial by

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,900
Let's move on to tip number three. Now it's
often said that in order to achieve fluency,

51
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,930
you have to focus on immersion. You have to
immerse yourself in the language. That's not

52
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:35,690
always an option for many people in the world.
Instead, I like to think of it as make fluency

53
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,590
a lifestyle choice. Do as much as you can
to immerse yourself in the language, but also

54
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,669
accept that it's not always possible especially
in a pandemic to travel over to a country,

55
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:50,020
give up your work, leave your family and spend
two months there to get fluent.

56
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,759
It's easy to compare yourself with other people.
For example, I always tell the story about

57
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,650
how I learned Spanish and it's frustrating
for other people to hear, "Oh, you got fluent

58
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,229
because you lived in Spain. So, of course,
you did, but what am I going to do?" The reality

59
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:09,840
is that before going to Spain I completely
immersed myself in Spanish whilst living in

60
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,450
England. It was my lifestyle change. I was
so passionate about learning the language

61
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,610
that I thought about it a lot of the time.
Spanish music, I listened to music, I watched

62
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,280
TV shows, films, I tried to speak with other
speakers of Spanish, I tried to meet as many

63
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,370
Spanish people as I possibly could, and I
spoke to them via WhatsApp, via Voice Notes.

64
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,729
I did everything I could to immerse myself
remotely.

65
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,889
One thing that I really like to get my students
to focus on is trying to think in English.

66
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:44,819
Take some time each day to really talk to
yourself out loud or in your head in that

67
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:50,240
language, no translating. Stop translating
in your head. Think in English or at least

68
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,250
try. For me, that was really the key to becoming
fluent. You may even find yourself developing

69
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,750
an additional personality in that second language.
This happened to me in Spanish. I've got English

70
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:06,750
Lucy in my head and I've got Spanish Lucy
in my head. We have different sense of humour,

71
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,240
we play with words and language in different
ways, and I am so happy with that. It's really

72
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,430
cool to discover that new part of yourself,
but you can only do that by really trying

73
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,449
to make it part of your lifestyle.

74
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:24,110
Tip number four is examine unique characteristics
of the language you're learning, English.

75
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,300
It's fairly easy to learn the basics especially
if you can translate to and from your mother

76
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,169
tongue. However, what really makes the difference
when it comes to achieving fluency is learning

77
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:41,181
things like phrasal verbs, idioms, humour,
really try and focus on those parts of the

78
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:45,300
language. Admittedly, they're the most difficult
parts to learn and that's why many people

79
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,070
don't achieve fluency.

80
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:51,800
Phrasal verbs and idioms are particularly
difficult because there are no real rules.

81
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,340
You have to learn them as you go. The best
technique I can think of is learning them

82
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,330
in context. If you are interested in improving
your phrasal verbs in English, I could always

83
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:06,319
look into developing something to help you
so let me know if you'd be interested in that.

84
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,240
In the meantime, I have got lots and lots
of videos on phrasal verbs and on idioms as

85
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,599
well. I have a place in my heart for idioms.
I absolutely love them in both English and

86
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,919
other languages.

87
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,590
My last tip is focus on pronunciation and,
in particular, I would say, focus on pronunciation

88
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,211
over grammar. I'm a pronunciation nerd. I've
never had too much time for grammar. This

89
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:33,890
is my personal view. I'm sure lots of teachers
may not agree with this but I think one of

90
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,919
the most important things is being able to
be understood. It's not about losing your

91
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,860
accent. It's about pronouncing each sound
correctly so that it's clear. That's why in

92
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,819
all of my vocabulary videos, I always add
the phonetic transcription. If you do not

93
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:55,310
know how to use the phonetic transcription,
I really recommend that you familiarise yourself

94
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,800
with it. I have created a tool on my website.
It's free to use, englishwithlucy.co.uk. I've

95
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,811
created the phonemic chart. It's got all of
the sounds that we use in modern RP and you

96
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:10,850
can click on each phoneme and hear me pronounce
it, and I've also got some words containing

97
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:16,599
each phoneme and you can click on those too
and hear me say them.

98
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,599
i:. No. eÉ™.

99
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,680
Learn how to use these IPA transcriptions
because they will transform the way you learn

100
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,590
pronunciation. Once you have mastered each
sound in English, you'll be able to put them

101
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:34,280
together and pronounce things in a much clearer
way. If you're really interested in learning

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,030
how to produce each sound, then I also have
my pronunciation course, all the information

103
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,200
for that is in the description box, but it's
very thorough.

104
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,760
Right. That's it for this lesson. I hope you
enjoyed it. I hope it motivated you slightly.

105
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,190
If you'd like to download the free PDF that
goes with this lesson, it's got the full transcript

106
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,550
and I've picked out the key vocab as well.
All you've got to do is click on the link

107
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:58,900
in the description box, enter your name and
your email address, you then sign up to my

Instagram, my Facebook, and my website, englishwithlucy.co.uk.

117
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,610
I will see you soon for another lesson.

118
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:56,223
It's nearly nine. I'm dying. It's just too
hot to film in the day. Is this on? Yeah.

119
00:09:56,223 --> 00:10:01,260
Oh it's about to go out of battery at some
point. Let's get on with it. I pronounce things

120
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:11,250
in a much more clear way. In a much clearer
way. Hello, everyone, and welcome back. Oh,

121
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,580
I need to slow down.
