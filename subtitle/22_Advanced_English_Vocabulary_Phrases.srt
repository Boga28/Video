00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,009
(energetic music)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:04,400
- Hello, this is Jack from tofluency.com,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,220
and welcome to this lesson
where you're going to learn

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,550
some advanced English phrases
based on a conversation

5
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,150
that my wife and I had about fall.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,410
Now, if you want to
watch that conversation,

7
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,737
then there's a link in the
description to do that.

8
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:22,270
You can also watch or listen to this

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,510
as a podcast episode, too.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,570
Just search for To
Fluency Podcast on iTunes,

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,550
Spotify or wherever you use.

12
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,720
So, yeah, we're going to
show various clips today

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,320
from the conversation, and
then I'm going to explain

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,360
what these phrases mean,
give you more examples,

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,510
and I'm gonna leave all the examples

16
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,410
in the description for you.

17
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,070
Now be sure to stay until the end

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,960
because I have a question
for you, as well.

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,702
Okay, let's get started
with the first clip.

20
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:54,010
(screen whooshes)

21
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,650
This is your favorite season.

22
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,510
- That's right, well, one
of my favorite seasons.

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,510
I actually really like the
transition from summer to fall.

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,157
- Kate said, "I really
like this transition

25
00:01:07,157 --> 00:01:09,650
"from summer to fall."

26
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,720
So I thought that fall
was her favorite season,

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,087
but she said, "Well, nearly,

28
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:18,360
"but it's that transition
from summer to fall."

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,580
Because that's the sweet spot here,

30
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,790
which means the temperature is just right

31
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,760
where you can go outside
and being comfortable.

32
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,510
It's not too hot and it's not too cold.

33
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,760
And I think I agree with Kate here.

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,280
So the word transition means to change

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,110
from one thing to something else.

36
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,810
Another example is, I know a lot of people

37
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,740
who become online teachers, and at first,

38
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,270
they find this transition
from traditional,

39
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,520
in-person lessons to
online lessons difficult.

40
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,540
So they find this change difficult.

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,438
They find this transition difficult.

42
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:58,640
(screen whooshes)

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,640
- So a few of the warmer
beverages and soups

44
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,943
and things that are more
hearty and comforting.

45
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:11,070
- Number two, hearty and comforting.

46
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,710
So Kate was talking about food here,

47
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,640
and she's talking about hearty food,

48
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,640
which basically means, in my
mind, it's when food is warm,

49
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,330
and it's very filling and satisfying.

50
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:30,330
So think of things like
lasagna, chilis and stews.

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,800
And to get a better idea
of what a hearty meal is,

52
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,220
then just Google search hearty meals

53
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,590
and see which recipes come up.

54
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,890
A similar word from the UK is stodgy.

55
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,750
It's not exactly the same,
but it's very similar.

56
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,130
And to have a stodgy meal
in the UK means to have lots

57
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:57,130
of carbohydrates, and it's
warm and it's filling,

58
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,487
things like pies or bangers and mash.

59
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:01,870
(screen whooshes)

60
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,440
- But it started to get a
little bit cooler at night.

61
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,990
But it started to get a
little bit cooler at night.

62
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,860
- It started to get a
little bit cooler at night.

63
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,700
So start to get, this is a verb pattern.

64
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,580
Now what's interesting
about this verb pattern

65
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,920
is that you have the
infinitive and the gerund

66
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,530
after the word, and they
both mean the same thing.

67
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,417
So you can say, "It started
to get a little bit cooler

68
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,417
"at night," or, "It started getting

69
00:03:32,417 --> 00:03:34,160
"a little bit cooler at night."

70
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,210
Another example is, I've
started working out again,

71
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,400
which is true.

72
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,210
Well, I didn't actually stop,
but let's say I stopped.

73
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,330
I've started working out again,

74
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,150
or, I've started to work out again.

75
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,250
Now Kate also used the word get there,

76
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,920
and get means become,

77
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,020
and again, it's talking
about a transition, a change.

78
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,460
Another example is, he
started to get a bit angry,

79
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,460
he started to get a bit angry.

80
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,530
I don't know why.
(screen whooshes)

81
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,013
For example, the th sound
is going away in London.

82
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:09,775
- Yeah?

83
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:10,608
- Because
- that's right.

84
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:11,760
- Yeah, nothin'

85
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,524
- Nothing.
- instead of nothing.

86
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:14,357
- Oh.

87
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:15,407
- So that th sound's going away,

88
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:18,470
and you can see on a map how. 

89
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,240
Now this one isn't an
expression or a word to learn.

90
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,780
Instead, it's just something interesting

91
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,890
where, in the UK, people are predicting

92
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:31,510
that the th sound might
disappear within 50 years.

93
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:35,030
Because a few years
ago, or a long time ago,

94
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:37,760
only a certain amount of people

95
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,850
made the f sound instead of the th sound.

96
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,710
For example, saying
"free" instead of "three".

97
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,430
Now sometimes I do this,
especially when I speak quickly,

98
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,720
and the map that I'm gonna leave a link to

99
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,160
in the description shows
that this is spreading

100
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,294
throughout the UK.

101
00:04:57,294 --> 00:04:58,890
Froughout or throughout?

102
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,560
But yeah, definitely check out that link

103
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,120
because it's interesting
and it shows the evolutions

104
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,408
of the English language in the UK.

105
00:05:06,408 --> 00:05:08,570
(screen whooshes)

106
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,720
Do an impression.
- No, I can't do an impression

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,520
of you, you know it.

108
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,430
I want to be able to do
a good impression of you,

109
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,210
and I think, in general, I
do do decent impressions,

110
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,790
but your accent is very hard for me.

111
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,130
- Yeah.

112
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,560
So Kate can't do an impression of me.

113
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,100
She tries. It's not always that accurate.

114
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,780
She really wants to be able
to do an impression of me,

115
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,410
and to do an impression of someone

116
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,600
means to imitate the
way that someone speaks.

117
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,920
We can also say "to do an
accent, to do an accent",

118
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,350
which means to imitate an accent.

119
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,560
Now some people say that I
can do a good New York accent.

120
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,130
I live in New York, I've
got my dog, I've got my car.

121
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,560
I go to the park. I like coffee.

122
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,070
I need to work on this a little bit,

123
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,170
and the way I'm doing this
actually is using my method

124
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,900
to listen, repeat, record, compare method,

125
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,230
where you listen to a phrase,

126
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,350
you record yourself repeating it,

127
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,830
and then you compare it to
the original and make changes.

128
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,430
Now, this is a method you can
use to learn English, as well,

129
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,370
and there is a link to the method,

130
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,864
a video, in the description.

131
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,390
(screen whooshes)
- Okay.

132
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,035
- But let's start with Halloween.

133
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:24,868
- Yes.

134
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,933
- Halloween is huge in the U.S.

135
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,790
I am always shocked every
year just by how big it is

136
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,003
and how early people
have to get prepared for.

137
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,560
Halloween is huge in the U.S.

138
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,760
It's huge, which means it's very popular.

139
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,620
Now, big, huge. Huge
normally means very big.

140
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,370
And you can say, "Halloween
is big. Halloween is huge."

141
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,570
Both of these words mean
popular in this case.

142
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,490
Another example is,
he's huge on Instagram,

143
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,050
which means he's very
popular on Instagram.

144
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,530
He has a lot of followers on Instagram.

145
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,080
And another one is, although
Oasis were huge in the UK,

146
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,340
they weren't very popular
or well-known in the U.S.

147
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,400
Here's a question. Were
Oasis popular where you are?

148
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,082
Are they still popular?
Leave a comment below.

149
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:23,280
(screen whooshes)
No.

150
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,507
- You said people will come
back and egg your house,

151
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:26,910
- Oh.
- if you don't

152
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,685
leave candy for people.

153
00:07:28,685 --> 00:07:29,700
- Yeah.

154
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,550
- Now to egg a house means
to throw eggs at a house,

155
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,180
and this is very naughty.

156
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,250
You can get in trouble if
you egg people's houses.

157
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,120
But it does happen. Some kids do do this.

158
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,260
People will egg a house or egg a car.

159
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,680
And again, this just means to throw eggs

160
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,930
at a house or a car.

161
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,060
And I was worried that
people would egg our house,

162
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,147
or Kate said, "People are
going to egg our house

163
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:56,590
"if you leave out carrots
instead of candy."

164
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,950
I was never going to leave
out carrots instead of candy,

165
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,700
but yeah, I still don't like kids

166
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,233
getting so much candy at Halloween.

167
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,370
(screen whooshes)

168
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,642
Everyone dresses up,
right? Parents, children?

169
00:08:09,642 --> 00:08:10,475
- Yeah.

170
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:12,590
- Most parents.
- Yeah.

171
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,910
- And it's hard to get
an outfit in the week

172
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:17,930
running up to Halloween
because everything's sold out,

173
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,713
which is why you often
do it six weeks before.

174
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,330
Everyone dresses up.

175
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,560
To dress up means to wear a costume.

176
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,370
Now the phrase of a dress-up
is specific to the UK

177
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,440
and probably Australia and Ireland,

178
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,289
but it's not used in the
U.S. because in the U.S.

179
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,606
you say "to wear a costume,
to wear a costume".

180
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:45,677
But I remember people in the UK saying,

181
00:08:45,677 --> 00:08:47,930
"What are you going to
dress as for Halloween?"

182
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,150
What are you going to
dress up as for Halloween?

183
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,860
And this is true. Some of
my friends hate dressing up.

184
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,502
They hate dressing up.

185
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:58,040
(screen whooshes)

186
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,040
- And every year, I just run
out of time a little bit,

187
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,520
but I think that you can get so creative

188
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,550
and do something really special, but-

189
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,270
- Every year, I just run out of time.

190
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,190
Every year, I just run out of time.

191
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,370
So to run out of time means
that you have no time left

192
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,780
because we normally leave
it to the last minute,

193
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,490
which means we do things
just before a deadline,

194
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,140
when it comes to making
costumes for Halloween.

195
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,810
So we always run out of time.

196
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,630
We don't have enough
time to make a costume.

197
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,850
Now listen to these two examples.

198
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,390
We're running out of sugar,
and we've run out of sugar.

199
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,420
We're running out of sugar,
and we've run out of sugar.

200
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,350
So if we're running out of sugar,

201
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,850
it means we still have a
little bit of sugar left,

202
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,840
but soon we won't have any left.

203
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,960
And if we say we've run out of sugar,

204
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,173
it means we have no sugar.

205
00:09:57,173 --> 00:09:58,988
(screen whooshes)

206
00:09:58,988 --> 00:09:59,890
- I had a whole design,

207
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,490
with like a headpiece and
a cape and my tentacles.

208
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:07,210
And in the end, all I ended up
wearing were like some tights

209
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,093
that I never had time to stuff.

210
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
- Kate's still talking
about a costume here

211
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,210
saying, "All I ended
up wearing was tights."

212
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,150
Now to end up doing something
means to conclude something

213
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,280
with a particular action.

214
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,100
And it's kind of hard to
explain how to use this,

215
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,070
but I think this example
is really gonna help you.

216
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,540
Imagine that you haven't
seen somebody in a while,

217
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,250
but the last time you saw
them, let's say two months ago,

218
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,350
they were telling you about their vacation

219
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,790
and that they wanted to go on a vacation,

220
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,550
but they weren't sure about
where they wanted to go.

221
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,157
And then, you see this friend
again today, and you say,

222
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:51,540
"Oh, where did you end
up going on vacation?"

223
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:54,120
Where did you end up going on vacation?

224
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,127
Where did you finally
decide to go on vacation?

225
00:10:57,127 --> 00:11:00,057
And they say, "We ended
up going to Preston."

226
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,547
Another example is, "We were
going to go out last night,

227
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:07,217
"but we ended up staying home

228
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:09,938
"and watching a terrible TV show."

229
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:12,110
(screen whooshes)

230
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,526
And sometimes it's been rainy and cold,

231
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:16,575
and they just want to eat the candy,

232
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:17,729
and then they get the sugar rush.

233
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:19,030
And then, the next day at school,

234
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,410
you know as a former teacher,
- Yeah.

235
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,840
- the day after Halloween
was the worst to teach.

236
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,080
To get a sugar rush.

237
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,230
This means to get that
uncontrollable energy

238
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,770
after eating too much sugar.

239
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,460
It's where kids,
especially, get hyperactive,

240
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,060
and they can't sit still and they shake

241
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,880
and they're constantly moving.

242
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,670
But then, after a sugar rush,
normally you got a crash,

243
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:49,030
and this is where you just
feel tired, sometimes cranky.

244
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,825
Sometimes children get
cranky after a sugar rush.

245
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,520
(screen whooshes)

246
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,100
The person who used to live in the house

247
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,160
that we live in now, it was known

248
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,400
as the best house in the neighborhood

249
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,590
'cause they had all these decorations,

250
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,240
but they didn't leave them for us.

251
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,580
- No.
- A neighbor got them.

252
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,413
- Uh huh.

253
00:12:07,413 --> 00:12:09,244
- So then, they put up all
these new decorations and. 

254
00:12:09,244 --> 00:12:10,360
- Yeah.

255
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,610
- Yeah, the person who
used to live in the house

256
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,570
where we live now.

257
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,080
So the person who used
to live in our house

258
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,400
means the person that lived
in our house in the past,

259
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,400
and people often get
confused between used to,

260
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,440
be used to and get used to.

261
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,300
For example, I used to live in Spain.

262
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,763
So in the past, I lived in Spain.

263
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,690
I am used to living in
America because I've been here

264
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,540
for 10 years and I'm
accustomed to living here.

265
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,940
I'm used to living here,
but I'll never get used

266
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,940
to people saying "yo-gurt"
instead of "yogg-urt".

267
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,222
I'm not gonna make that transition.

268
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:57,270
(screen whooshes)

269
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,230
What happens when the leaves fall?

270
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,003
We'll say it on three. One, two, three.

271
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,150
One, one, two, three.

272
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:08,100
Bag them up.
- Oh.

273
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,947
- We'll put them in
compost (laughs lightly).

274
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:16,563
To bag something up means
to put something in a bag.

275
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,320
Next.
(screen whooshes)

276
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,960
- It's a little bit
crisper, it's more crisp,

277
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,940
and there's a little bit of
a chill in the air at night.

278
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,020
- Yeah, chill in the air.

279
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,880
What do I say when I come outside,

280
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,053
and there's a chill in the
air and it's not humid?

281
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,167
Kate talked about the weather saying,

282
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:41,550
"It was crisp and there
was a chill in the air."

283
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:45,530
Now if something is crisp
or if the weather is crisp,

284
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,530
it means that it is cold, but also clear.

285
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,020
So you can imagine those winter days

286
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,030
when it's cold but clear.

287
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,480
So the sun is shining.

288
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,890
And if there's a chill in the air,

289
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,500
it means it's not too cold,

290
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,870
but you're uncomfortable due to the cold

291
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,072
and you need to put some more layers on.

292
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,654
You need to put some more clothes on.

293
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:09,590
(screen whooshes)

294
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,780
Yeah, I remember celebrating
my birthday here,

295
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,440
and it was really warm.

296
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,800
So I've never had a warm sunny day

297
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,600
on my birthday in my life.

298
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,730
But it can be hit or miss.

299
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,100
It could be, it could be cold

300
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,850
- Yeah.
- near the end of October.

301
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,910
I was talking about my birthday
here, and how sometimes,

302
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,140
at the end of October where
we live, it's warm and sunny,

303
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,000
but sometimes it's cold.

304
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,750
So the weather can be hit or miss,

305
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,440
meaning it's inconsistent.

306
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,280
It can be good or bad.

307
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,030
Another example is, that
restaurant is hit or miss.

308
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,510
Sometimes you get something great.

309
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,280
Sometimes the food is terrible.

310
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,925
Usually, it depends on what you order.

311
00:14:52,925 --> 00:14:54,700
(energetic music)

312
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,170
Okay, so those are the
advanced phrases for you.

313
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,580
Again, be sure to watch the conversation

314
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,510
or listen to the conversation
on your favorite podcast app.

315
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,150
And then, also go to the
description to have a look

316
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,520
at the phrases that we've talked about

317
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,240
and just to read the
examples that I've given you.

318
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,670
And while you're down
there in the description,

319
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,920
check out the other videos, as well,

320
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,057
and be sure to get my book,

321
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:21,530
"The 5 Step Plan for English Fluency".

322
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,710
And before I share the question,

323
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,410
I just want to say, if you're new here

324
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,070
or if you're old here, like the video.

325
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,690
And if you're new here, subscribe

326
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,840
and turn on the notification bell.

327
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,630
Now my question for you is,
what is a typical Halloween like

328
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:42,300
where you live, and do you
dress up for this event?

329
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,290
Do you dress up for Halloween?

330
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,700
So leave those comments below.

331
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,270
I look forward to reading them.

332
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,280
Again, thank you for being here,

333
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,290
and I will speak to you soon.

334
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,841
Bye-bye.
