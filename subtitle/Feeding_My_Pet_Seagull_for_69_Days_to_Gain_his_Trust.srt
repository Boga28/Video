939
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,159
but don't worry my hands are safe

940
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,639
safe for now but i will eat them

941
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,760
eventually

942
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,599
if hands are what you want hands are

943
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,520
what you will get a happy seagull is

944
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,320
priceless

945
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,560
we are such a good team you give my life

946
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,918
meaning bye buddy

947
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,159
for the past 40 days i've been feeding

948
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,399
my pet seagull to gain his trust

949
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,520
i gave him lobster and he gave me rabies

950
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,599
he is so cheeky yesterday we got a

951
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,679
comment that really warmed my heart

952
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,320
warm heart can i eat it no steven i'm

953
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,599
talking about yesterday

954
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,679
when you showed up with only one leg i

955
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,040
was so worried and sad

956
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,960
but it was only a prank you still have

957
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,639
both of your little pinkers

958
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,480
can you hurry up and get to the point

959
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
 the comment said that birds only

960
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,480
stand on one leg to have a rest

961
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,639
so what they also said that birds only

962
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,639
do this when they feel comfortable

963
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,040
safe and at home you make me feel so

964
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,680
safe

965
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,920
and your friendship is the greatest gift

966
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,599
my life has ever given me

967
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,000
day number 40 of feeding my pet seagull

968
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,119
to gain his trust

969
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,599
our last idea to get him to eat inside

970
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,720
didn't really work

971
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
i think it was too low for him he was

972
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,640
too shy but today

973
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,680

974
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,640
