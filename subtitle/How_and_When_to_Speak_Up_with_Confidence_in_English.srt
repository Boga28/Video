1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,830
How much do you struggle
with knowing when and how to

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:07,230
speak up in a conversation in English,

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,150
especially when no one pauses to ask
you what you think? Here's what, I mean,

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,290
a few weeks ago,

5
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:18,150
I received an email from someone who
recently started to work full time in a

6
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:21,270
completely English
environment. And for her,

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,950
the problem isn't following
the conversation and

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,620
it isn't coming up with
valuable things to say,

9
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:32,310
she's able to do both of those
things very well in English.

10
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,930
The problem is how and when to speak up,

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,730
when there isn't a clear break in
the conversation and when no one asks

12
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:46,650
her. Here was her specific
frustration, "but how to,

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,760
and when to express my thoughts
in a meeting is a challenge.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,530
If I am specifically being asked during
the meeting to share my thoughts,

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,070
I can do it. But often I
find that I don't know,

16
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:04,020
or I'm not quite sure how to
start sharing my thoughts without

17
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,870
being asked." Just like my student,

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,550
you might be waiting for the perfect
moment to jump into a conversation,

19
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,950
but that perfect moment never
comes. So what do you do?

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,240
If you don't already know I'm
Annemarie with Speak Confident English,

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,860
everything I do here is designed to
help you get the confidence you want for

22
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:29,460
your life and work in
English. Now, with this topic,

23
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:34,260
you might be curious about how
to interrupt a conversation in

24
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,510
English, and I've already
got a lesson on that.

25
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:41,280
So if you're looking for specific phrases
to help you interrupt a conversation,

26
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,250
I'll share a link to
that lesson, but here,

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,110
we're going to talk about how you can
fully participate in English conversations

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,810
without feeling rude for interrupting,

29
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,700
without apologizing and without
missing opportunities to

30
00:01:56,701 --> 00:01:58,590
speak. In other words,

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,430
knowing how and when to speak up.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,213
[Inaudible].

33
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,160
All right. Here's how this
lesson is going to work today.

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,280
We're going to split it into
two parts at the beginning.

35
00:02:14,281 --> 00:02:19,170
We're going to start with three
simple ways for you to know how to

36
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:21,330
speak up. In other words,

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,660
what signals can you
listen for or watch for?

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,900
And what signals can you use to
show that you have something to say?

39
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:32,730
Then we'll transition into
what to say when it's the

40
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,570
right moment.

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,670
And what I mean by that is that
the moment might arise on its

42
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:42,330
own, or you might have
to create that moment.

43
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,400
So let's get started with those
three tips on how to speak up.

44
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,960
Tip number one is to listen
carefully for opportune moments.

45
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,060
What this means is rather
than focus internally on

46
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,070
what it is that you want to say and
worrying about the right moment,

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,740
staying engaged in the conversation,

48
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,660
follow it and listen for those
little signals or moments that

49
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,060
allow you the space to speak up.

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,290
Remember others won't always stop
and ask what you're thinking.

51
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,680
Sometimes you just have
to jump in. Of course,

52
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,290
when we talk about opportune
moments to jump in,

53
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,090
ideally there would be a pause
in the conversation or a natural

54
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,640
transition. When I say a pause,

55
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,580
what I mean is that someone
has clearly finished speaking.

56
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,800
There are several seconds of silence.

57
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,280
So that's a great time
to jump in and speak up.

58
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:41,470
Similarly, a natural transition
is also a great time to do that.

59
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,390
That is when the conversation begins
to shift to a new topic. For example,

60
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:50,500
maybe you're in a business meeting
going through items on an agenda.

61
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,360
And when the conversation
starts to shift to a new topic,

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,010
that's a great moment to jump in and
say what you want to say before the

63
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:01,600
conversation moves forward.

64
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,310
The problem is sometimes those
opportune moments never happen.

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,750
There are too many people in
the conversation everyone's
trying to contribute,

66
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,580
so that perfect pause or that
perfect natural transition never

67
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:20,200
occurs when that's the case. It's
time to move on to tip number two,

68
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,630
use body language,

69
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,820
whether you're participating in
an online video conference or in a

70
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,020
face-to-face meeting,

71
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,150
a simple raise of the hand is a great
indication that you have something to say.

72
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,910
Similarly, if the meeting is online,

73
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:41,770
you can use a raised hand reaction
or even type in the chat that

74
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:45,760
you have something that you
want to contribute. If the
meeting is face-to-face,

75
00:04:45,761 --> 00:04:49,750
you can also lean forward
into the conversation.

76
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,610
That also is a signal that you're
fully engaged and have something to

77
00:04:54,611 --> 00:04:56,230
contribute. Now,

78
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,890
if you're worried that body
language just isn't going to work,

79
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:04,900
let's go on to tip number three,
take advantage of the agenda.

80
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,950
If your team has access to the
meeting, agenda in advance,

81
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,350
take time to review it and identify
at which point in the agenda would be

82
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:17,470
the best opportunity for
you to add your ideas.

83
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,180
Then to confirm that there's time for you
to share your thoughts in the meeting.

84
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:26,560
You can mention to your boss that you
have something you'd like to share prior

85
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:30,040
to the meeting. By giving
your boss or a colleague,

86
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,080
a heads up that you have something to say.

87
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,210
It's very likely that they will make sure
to pass the baton onto you during the

88
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:37,954
meeting. Following

89
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,240
any one of those tips will help
you create opportunities for you to

90
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:46,960
participate and speak up
when you want to. Now,

91
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,880
before we go on to what to say,
when you start to speak up,

92
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,570
I have one recommendation
for you. When you know,

93
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:59,810
you have something to contribute,
don't wait too long to say it.

94
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,590
Have you ever noticed that while you're
sitting in the meeting and thinking

95
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:06,650
about what you want to
say, the longer you wait,

96
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,660
the more anxious you get,

97
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,970
rather than sit with that
anxiety and risk feeling stuck

98
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,430
or losing your thoughts.
When you start to speak,

99
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,280
don't wait too long in the conversation.

100
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,330
This doesn't mean that you have to
be the very first one to speak up.

101
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,670
If you're not comfortable
with that, you don't need to,

102
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,010
but perhaps after the first
person responds to a question or

103
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,950
the first person initiates a conversation,

104
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,840
you could be person number two or
three to jump into the conversation.

105
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,740
Now that we have those
tips and my recommendation,

106
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,090
let's talk about what to say
when you have the opportunity.

107
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,261
For this,

108
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:53,240
I have three recommendations to
help you think about how to phrase

109
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,970
your initial sentences when it's time
to speak up. Recommendation number

110
00:06:57,471 --> 00:06:59,270
one is pose a question.

111
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,610
What I mean by this is rather than
immediately stating what you want to say,

112
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:09,320
start with a simple question that
politely asks for permission to

113
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:14,000
jump in or to interject doing this helps
to ensure that you've chosen the right

114
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:18,470
moment to jump in. And if someone
isn't quite finished speaking,

115
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,970
or if they want you to hold on, just for
a moment, they can tell you to do so,

116
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,160
but they know that you
have something to say.

117
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,380
You've made it clear
that you want to jump in.

118
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,650
So here are a few great ways to do that.

119
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,420
Could I jump in quickly and share
my thoughts here? May I add to that?

120
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,360
Excuse me, may I share
my thoughts on this?

121
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,860
These questions are particularly useful
when you're not really sure about the

122
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:45,410
discussion dynamics. For example,

123
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:49,970
let's say you've just joined a new team
and you're not really sure how everyone

124
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:53,360
communicates by posing
one of these questions.

125
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:58,130
It opens a window of opportunity for
you to contribute to the conversation

126
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,630
without feeling guilty and without
apologizing recommendation.

127
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:05,870
Number two is to politely
assert your thoughts.

128
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,080
If you're sure that you've chosen
the right moment to jump in,

129
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,730
rather than posing a question, you
can simply state your intention.

130
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,770
For example, I'd like to jump in
here or while we're on this topic,

131
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,280
I'd like to discuss.
And finally, if I could,

132
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:24,110
I'd like to add my 2 cents.

133
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,970
Here's how one of these sentence starters
might sound in a complete sentence.

134
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,830
I'd like to jump in to point out that we
need to define our deadlines before we

135
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:37,820
move on to the next stage. And
now recommendation number three,

136
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,990
piggyback on others to create
moments for you to speak up.

137
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,190
As I've mentioned in a previous lesson
on how to think out loud in English,

138
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,410
piggybacking on other's ideas is a
great moment to jump in and share

139
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,280
your thoughts.

140
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,330
And it also shows that you have
appreciation or respect for what someone

141
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,840
else has said. When you piggyback
on someone else's thoughts.

142
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,110
What it means is that you listen
to what they have to say carefully.

143
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,520
Then when it's your time to speak up,
or when you create that opportunity,

144
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,320
you acknowledge what they've said
and add to it with your own ideas.

145
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,530
Here are several ways that
we do that in English.

146
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,450
I agree with Anna and I would like to
add, thank you for bringing this up.

147
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:25,320
I'd like to point out
that before we move on,

148
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:29,250
I'd like to discuss a
related idea. Excuse me.

149
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:32,820
I'd love to add to Anna's
thoughts. And lastly,

150
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,210
while I agree with what
Anna said, I think,

151
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,550
and then you continue with your
opinion now that you know how

152
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,470
and when to speak up in English,

153
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,280
let's do a little bit of practice so
that you're a hundred percent ready to

154
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:51,000
implement these strategies. The
next time you're in a conversation,

155
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,490
I have two scenarios for you,

156
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,640
and I want you to use these
as practice opportunities,

157
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,680
listen carefully to these scenarios and
consider what you've learned today and

158
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:06,270
how you would create an opportunity for
you to jump into the conversation and

159
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:08,940
speak up in scenario. Number one,

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,980
imagine that you disagree strongly
with one of your coworkers on how to

161
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,320
deal with a client during the meeting,

162
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:19,560
your colleague discusses
the situation at length,

163
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,260
and there's not really a
moment for you to jump in.

164
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,350
How might you create that opportunity?

165
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,600
How could you identify a moment
to jump in and create a space

166
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:32,280
for you to express your opinion?

167
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,540
Think about the tips and recommendations
you've learned here today.

168
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,290
How would you put those together
and use them in this scenario?

169
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:44,700
You can share your practice example
with me in the comments below,

170
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,950
and now let's move on to practice
scenario. Number two in this scenario,

171
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:54,000
imagine that you've joined a new team
and you've been working with them for

172
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:58,770
about two months. At this point, you are
getting more comfortable with the team,

173
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,600
but there are some meetings when
you still feel a bit hesitant about

174
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,560
asserting yourself and
jumping into the conversation

175
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,140
based on what you've learned here,

176
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:15,240
how would you plan to speak up
in the next team meeting when

177
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:18,600
you have something that you
want to contribute again,

178
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,900
you can share your examples
with me in the comments below.

179
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:27,570
If you found today's lesson useful to
you as always, I would love to know.

180
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:31,470
And the best way that you can tell me is
to give this lesson a thumbs up here on

181
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:35,160
