1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,659
So, you might or might
not know this, but I

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:09,560
am a private teacher,
so if you're struggling

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,188
with things in English,
I have online private

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,840
lessons, englishwithronnie.com,
and I'll help

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,934
you anything you need
in English; pronunciation,

6
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:25,940
vocabulary, crazy
things like this.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,460
This is for one of my
students, Braino, this is for you.

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,530
A lot of the times in
our classes, students

9
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:37,260
have specific questions,
like, "Bronnie, what's

10
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,320
the difference between
'as long as' and 'as far as'?"

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,220
And I go, "Oh, god,
that's a good question.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,260
Let me check..."

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:54,500
Whoa, there's a lot to explain about this
one, so I'll make a video about it for you.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,247
But if you have
questions like this, I'm sure

15
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,140
they come up all the
time, I'll help you answer

16
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,960
those, and I'll walk you through
what each of these crazy things mean.

17
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:14,660
So, this lesson is to help you with "as
long as" versus "as far as", "as long as".

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,342
We use this for a
period of time, so we can

19
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:23,220
say, you can stay
here-period of time-as long

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,100
as you like, or you can stay
here for as long as you want.

21
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,600
So, I'm telling you that this
is a period of time or duration.

22
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,140
I can't say, you can stay
here as far as you like.

23
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,960
That doesn't make sense.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,159
So, for this one,
we're talking about a

25
00:01:41,171 --> 00:01:43,620
period of time, we
have to say "as long as".

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,300
Next one.

27
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,920
This is kind of fun.

28
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,840
Do you guys hate
conditionals, like "if" or "when"?

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,140
Huh.

30
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,280
So, we can substitute conditionals,
and we can use "as long as".

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,700
As long as you pay,
you can eat here.

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,999
I can substitute "as
long as" in this sentence

33
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:12,440
for "if", so I could
say, hey, if you pay,

34
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,340
you can eat here.

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,499
Now, another cool
thing about this sentence,

36
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:20,220
because I have a
little star here, is I can

37
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,020
also reverse the
order of the sentence.

38
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:38,040
I can definitely say, hey, guess what, you
can eat here-comma-as long as, or you can

39
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,600
substitute "if" you pay.

40
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,080
So, this is a
conditional, right?

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,280
If you don't pay, guess
what, you can't eat here.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,860
But as long as you do this,
then you have permission.

43
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,480
So, this is a requirement.

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,080
As long as you give me
money, I will give you lessons.

45
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,960
If you give me money,
I will give you lessons.

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
It's like a trade.

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,620
We also talk about length
when we're comparing something.

48
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,720
My coat is as long as his.

49
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,300
So, as long as makes sense, we
talk about the length of something.

50
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,060
Long means length.

51
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,880
Length means how
long something is.

52
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,940
When you measure things, right?

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,200
What's the length of something?

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,660
And also, we can use "since",
and this one we can change, too.

55
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,320
As long as you're
here, let's drink.

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,720
It's just another way of saying
since you're here, let's drink.

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,420
Or because of the reason
why you're here, woo, let's drink.

58
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,060
Now, I can switch this.

59
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,141
I can say, "Let's
drink as long as you're

60
00:03:52,153 --> 00:03:55,460
here", but we have to
be careful because this

61
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,620
one can change its meaning.

62
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,060
So, since you're
here, let's drink.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,980
Since you're here, let's drink.

64
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,920
Let's drink since or
because you're here.

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,840
Because of your very presence.

66
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,480
It is just inspired me to drink.

67
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,680
Maybe that's a good thing.

68
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,500
I don't know.

69
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,165
So, if you see an
asterisk or a star beside

70
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:23,020
these sentences, it
means that we can change

71
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,260
the order of the sentence.

72
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,640
And it's cool.

73
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,620
It's just fun.

74
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,060
Woo.

75
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,520
Look at how much fun we're
having with grammar today.

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,320
Yes.

77
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,060
Someone hold me back.

78
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,060
As far as...

79
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,820
This one's fun.

80
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,800
This shows the extent of
your knowledge or your...

81
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
I guess your appear...

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,740
Not appears.

83
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,280
Opinion.

84
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,140
But we'll get to that one.

85
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,180
So, as far as I can
see, you have three kids.

86
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,420
You might have more
kids, but I don't know.

87
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,040
And we can use
verbs like "see" or "tell".

88
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,460
As far as I can tell,
it's going to rain.

89
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,080
Yeah, there's clouds.

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,920
As far as I can see,
it's going to rain.

91
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,960
As far as I know...

92
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,700
So, I'm telling
you that I know...

93
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,580
I don't know everything;
I know a little bit.

94
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,660
It's like a limit.

95
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,140
Okay?

96
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,620
It's perfect as far as I know.

97
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,200
So this is an example of
how I've inverted the sentence.

98
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,520
I can say, "As far as
I know, it's perfect."

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,620
Or "It's perfect
as far as I know."

100
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,760
It doesn't change the
meaning of the sentence.

101
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,600
As far as I can tell,
it's going to rain.

102
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,953
I can say, "Oh, it's
going to rain as far

103
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:44,040
as I can tell, but I'm
not a weather person,

104
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,600
so don't ask."

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,680
Distance.

106
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,320
Now, these ones
we cannot switch.

107
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:49,740
Okay?

108
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,420
Don't...

109
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,140
Do not change the order
of this sentence, please.

110
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,520
And this is telling us kind of our
limitations on something; our limits.

111
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,540
"We will travel
as far as we can."

112
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,800
But then we're just, like,
done, going to sleep now.

113
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,260
"The grass grew
as far as the fence."

114
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:18,120
So that means up to the limit of
the fence, there is no more grass.

115
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,480
So we're giving it a
distance and a limit.

116
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,440
"I ran as far as
the school, yeah!"

117
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,280
And then I died, because
I'm not good at running.

118
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:38,620
And the last one, we use this a lot, "As
far as I'm concerned, you did a great job."

119
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:44,300
I can also invert this, "You did a
great job, as far as I'm concerned."

120
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,560
Or, oh, yeah, "You're a
horrible person, as far as I know.

121
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,680
As far as I know,
you're a horrible person."

122
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,780
So again, we can switch those.

123
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,080
And this is only giving
someone your opinion.

124
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,436
It's kind of weird
because we have "far" and

125
00:07:05,448 --> 00:07:08,300
"long", and they might
be the same in your

126
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,420
languages, but I
hope this helps.

127
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,020
I hope you can
work some things out.

128
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,111
And as far as I know,
these are all the examples

129
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:20,240
that I've got to give
you for this lesson.

130
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,340
EnglishWithRonnie.com if you want
to have private online classes with me.

131
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,240
As far as I know,
I'm out of time.

132
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,000
I got to go.

133
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,580
I'm...

134
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:30,960
Yeah.

135
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,340
Bye.
