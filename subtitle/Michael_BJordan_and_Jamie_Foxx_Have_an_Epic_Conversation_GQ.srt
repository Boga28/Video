1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,730
- You said something in an interview,

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:04,300
that I don't even know
if you knew that I knew,

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,157
they were asking you about,

4
00:00:05,157 --> 00:00:06,887
"When are you gonna do black characters?

5
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:08,715
"You're gonna be blackety-black-black
and be black-black.

6
00:00:08,715 --> 00:00:09,836
[Michael chuckles]

7
00:00:09,836 --> 00:00:11,840
"And that's what you're gonna do."

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,547
And you actually said, "No,
I want to do characters."

9
00:00:16,547 --> 00:00:19,047
[lo-fi music]

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,880
I've known this young man

11
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,680
since he had the tank top and the. 

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,132
- Cornrows.
- Cornrows.

13
00:00:31,132 --> 00:00:31,965
- Aw, man.

14
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,758
- [Interviewer] And how long ago was that?

15
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:36,596
- Ten, twelve, fifteen?

16
00:00:36,596 --> 00:00:37,429
- Somethin' like that.

17
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:38,994
- [Interviewer] Wow.
- Yeah, at least like,

18
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:40,540
over a decade for sure.

19
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,373
- Over a decade.

20
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:42,206
- Yeah, yeah, I was probably like,

21
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:44,067
in my late teens like, maybe 19.

22
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,940
- Yeah, late teens, so it was like,

23
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,823
that was a while.

24
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:49,960
I'll tell you one specific
thing when not even,

25
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,440
[clears throat] I don't
know if you remember this,

26
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,640
when you came to L.A.,

27
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,890
there was thing called. 

28
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,860
The Basketball, what was it, the. 

29
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,190
- The NBA E League.
- The NBA E League.

30
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,319
- It was the E League back
then, back then, yeah.

31
00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:03,320
- But it was really a league

32
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,520
for people who weren't athletic,

33
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,553
who were in movies who
wanted to look good. 

34
00:01:08,553 --> 00:01:09,460
[Michael chuckles]

35
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,160
. you know, on the court.

36
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,370
You know, 'cause their girlfriends
was coming and watching.

37
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,203
And then he shows up,

38
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:19,143
and you understand why his
name is Michael Jordan.

39
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:19,976
[Michael laughs]

40
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:22,404
And he did a move on some actor.

41
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:24,850
He did a move, the actor lost him,

42
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,490
the actor ended up in the parking lot.

43
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,880
[Michael laughs]

44
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,287
And he was just killin' everybody

45
00:01:29,287 --> 00:01:31,220
and it was just amazing to watch.

46
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,652
I think they complained about you.

47
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:34,157
It was like, "No, we don't. "

48
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:35,637
"He's too athletic."

49
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,565
"This doesn't go with my narrative."

50
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:39,860
- [laughs] But yeah,

51
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,880
I think the E League was probably

52
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,033
one of the first times we started to meet.

53
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,550
- But you know what I'll say about you,

54
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,400
is that nothin's really changed.

55
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,258
It's like, you know,

56
00:01:56,258 --> 00:02:00,530
you filled out, most definitely. [laughs]

57
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,976
- No, I was skinny when
I got to L.A., man.

58
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:03,809
- Look how you --

59
00:02:03,809 --> 00:02:04,642
Oh, see what you did?

60
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:05,651
See what you did?

61
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:06,617
When I gon' to touch you,

62
00:02:06,617 --> 00:02:07,600
you say "Aye. "

63
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,433
- Nah, it was one of those things,

64
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,840
I guess coming from Jersey,

65
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,170
you know, moving to L.A. like most,

66
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,120
trying to you know,

67
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,070
follow the dream,

68
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,360
you know, grind,

69
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,230
hopefully become successful as
an actor and stuff like that

70
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,690
and you would find these
little groups and cliques

71
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:25,440
you know, of people that would hang out,

72
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
and somehow I just kinda,

73
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,050
you know, finessed my way in to like,

74
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,203
you know, on the court, I said,

75
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:32,097
"All right, well, I know
I can hoop, so like,

76
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:33,330
"At least we can figure this out."

77
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,398
- And the girls was,

78
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:37,089
"Oh! Who's the guy over?"

79
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:37,922
- Nah, it was. 

80
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,560
- Which really made them want to

81
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,620
kick you out of the league.

82
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,510
[Michael laughs]

83
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,270
- But nah, but Jamie was
one of the, you know,

84
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,400
the first people that I met in Los Angeles

85
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,530
that really kind of
took me under his wing,

86
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,960
and gave advice and you know,

87
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,250
he saw what I was trying to do,

88
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,700
and he wanted to, you know, protect me

89
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,030
from some of the pitfalls and obstacles

90
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,410
you know, that are out in L.A.,

91
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,243
and you know, you wanted to,

92
00:03:01,243 --> 00:03:02,130
always wanted to, you know, make sure I. 

93
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,040
- Yeah, because living in L.A. is. 

94
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,410
Living in L.A. is an interesting thing

95
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,410
because it is a place
of plastic, what I feel,

96
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,237
but there's also a place where artists go,

97
00:03:14,237 --> 00:03:16,120
and I feel like seeing you,

98
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,800
there was more to you than
just, I think just surface.

99
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,860
Now, I don't know what I or
any of my homies were reading,

100
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,530
but there was a special quality about you

101
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,377
that was like, huh. 

102
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,210
It's interesting,

103
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,726
and even everything
that we watched you do,

104
00:03:33,726 --> 00:03:36,582
there was a certain type of,

105
00:03:36,582 --> 00:03:38,139
it's weird to say this,

106
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:39,811
the "It" thing, or the integrity,

107
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:42,144
or if it was a younger verb,

108
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,918
this wasn't around then -- the swag.

109
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:50,344
- Oh.  [laughs]

110
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:51,560
- I'll say this:

111
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,087
The ingredients of what it
is in being a movie star

112
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,250
along with the type of material

113
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,030
that you were about to
get into as an actor.

114
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:06,750
Because I do think that
there are two sides,

115
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,070
I think there's celebrity
and then there's the actor.

116
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:14,070
But you gave me the energy
that you wanted both,

117
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,243
that you wanted whatever
you were doing to be. 

118
00:04:19,243 --> 00:04:21,149
- I just wanted to compete.

119
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:21,982
- Oh, i'mma tell you.

120
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,050
You wanted to compete,
and here was the thing,

121
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,883
it was interesting,

122
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:25,150
to take the competition,

123
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,330
but also you said
something in an interview

124
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,900
that I don't even know
if you knew that I knew,

125
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,217
they were asking you about,

126
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,497
"When are you gonna do black characters?

127
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:34,830
"You're gonna be blackety-black-black
and be black-black.

128
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,840
[Michael chuckles]

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,450
"And that's what you're gonna do."

130
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,647
And you actually said,

131
00:04:38,647 --> 00:04:41,740
"No, I want to do characters.

132
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,010
I don't want to be in --"

133
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,000
You remember that?
- Yeah.

134
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,125
- What was that?

135
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,049
- I can't remember the interview,

136
00:04:47,049 --> 00:04:47,882
but it was kind of like,

137
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:50,060
the way I've thought
about it was just like,

138
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,060
there's always a bias somewhere,
it's human nature, right?

139
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,187
So even with writers, you know,

140
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:55,950
there's not a lot of, you
know, successful black writers

141
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,790
that are writing, you know,

142
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,020
write like, for the, you know, big movies,

143
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,350
and at the time, you know,
there wasn't really that. 

144
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,670
There wasn't enough material
out there being written for us

145
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,700
that wasn't very stereotypical.

146
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,533
- [Jamie] Right.

147
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:08,720
- I've been blessed with my career

148
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,850
to play some stereotypical characters

149
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,294
that lasted the test of time

150
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:16,790
that just was bigger than that box

151
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,837
that they tried to put me in, you know,

152
00:05:17,837 --> 00:05:19,410
"The Wire", "Friday Night
Lights", stuff like that,

153
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,243
the characters --

154
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:21,360
- And talking about the "The Wire",

155
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,988
because I believe in the interview

156
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:24,440
[clears throat] you did reference to that,

157
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,200
but talk about the
significance of "The Wire".

158
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,010
- I mean, "The Wire" for me was at a time

159
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,390
where you know, Wallace. 

160
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,280
You know, corner boy, you know,

161
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,190
but he was the heartbeat of season one,

162
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,280
he was the heartbeat of that
show, everybody loved him.

163
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,240
So when he died, it hurt everyone.

164
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,181
- It hurt all of us.

165
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,156
- [Michael] David Simon, you know,

166
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,100
he knocked on the trailer door,

167
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,660
but you know, you never wanna
get that knock on the trailer,

168
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,493
'cause you know, because you know,

169
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:46,326
you know what I'm saying?

170
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:47,950
When you get scripts,

171
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,240
when you're on a show where nobody's safe,

172
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,644
you always try to skim through --

173
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:51,477
- Oh man, it just seems. 

174
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:52,310
"Do I die today?"

175
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,200
- Exactly, so Wallace was
one of those characters

176
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,230
that everybody watched,

177
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,930
everybody in Hollywood watched,

178
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,480
all the right people, the
casting directors, the producers,

179
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,349
you know what I'm saying,
the studio execs, you know. 

180
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:06,870
So when the right people
that are gonna eventually see

181
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,805
your name come across
their desk, you know,

182
00:06:07,805 --> 00:06:11,140
when it comes to different
jobs and roles, you know,

183
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,050
it helps that they're
a fan of certain things

184
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,260
and Wallace was one of those characters

185
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,650
that really did that for me.

186
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,067
But my mentality behind it all was like,

187
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:21,000
"I wanna play the roles that --"

188
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,570
Brad Pitt's one of my favorite actors,

189
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,490
you know, Leonardo DiCaprio's
one of my favorites,

190
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,965
Tom Hanks, Giovanni Ribisi,
you know what I'm saying,

191
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:30,170
Edward Norton, these are
cats that I really enjoy,

192
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,550
you, Will, Denzel, obviously,
you know what I'm saying,

193
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,260
the Mount Rushmore of actors,

194
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,560
but I would hate seeing,

195
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,530
I'd be in an audition, you know,

196
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,889
for the role of the year,

197
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:43,980
you know what I'm saying,

198
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,000
that's not one of those
stereotypical characters

199
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,320
and you would see
everybody from, you know,

200
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,730
ages 40 down to 17 going
out for this one role

201
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,660
and then everybody's
sitting in the audition room

202
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,640
looking at each other
like, afraid to speak,

203
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,220
and you know, it's like
this whole pitted tension,

204
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,587
and my way around that was just like,

205
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,247
"Look, man, I wanna play
roles that are people.

206
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:05,007
"Of course, me with the skin that I have,

207
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,387
"The person that I am,
stepping into that character,

208
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:08,897
"I'm gonna make it inherently black,

209
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:09,850
"That's what it's gonna be."

210
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,937
So I told my agents and everybody,

211
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:12,527
"Look, I wanna go out for every role

212
00:07:12,527 --> 00:07:15,220
"that's written for you
know, like, a Caucasian man,

213
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,547
"I want those roles, because
when I take that role,

214
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:19,947
"I'm gonna make it me.

215
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:21,987
"You know what, but it's just people,

216
00:07:21,987 --> 00:07:22,820
"It's just characters."

217
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,440
- And why did you feel --

218
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,140
[clears throat] I guess I'm saying,

219
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,720
I understand that, but
what gave you that edge?

220
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,140
What made you think that way?

221
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,827
Did you just see all this
clutter and you just said,

222
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,330
"I don't want to be in that box"?

223
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,630
- It was just one of those
things that were like,

224
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,463
how do you. 

225
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,100
Reverse engineering the problem.

226
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,982
- Right.

227
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,284
- You know what I'm saying, like it was. 

228
00:07:41,284 --> 00:07:43,700
You know, I started thinking back like,

229
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,220
why I never saw a lot of your generation

230
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,570
at each other's premieres.

231
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,403
- Right, oh!

232
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,297
- [Michael] You know
what I'm saying, like,

233
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:53,587
"Oh, I've never seen this person
at that person's premiere,

234
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:54,820
"Or that person at that person's --"

235
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,660
Like, damn, why is that?

236
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,493
You know what I mean?

237
00:07:56,493 --> 00:07:59,460
Like what's the subtext there?

238
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,180
- Yeah, like why aren't they
supporting or why isn't --

239
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,868
- And if they are, why can't I see that?

240
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:06,701
You get what I'm saying?

241
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,780
And then I started thinking
about my own circumstances

242
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,320
with other actors that are my generation,

243
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,590
and you see 'em out
and people won't speak.

244
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,500
They won't say "What's up?"

245
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,880
'cause at the time, it was competition.

246
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,367
and I couldn't be friendly
with my competition,

247
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:22,340
"Oh, he got that role that I wanted."

248
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,367
So it was a subtext, but I was like,

249
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:27,944
"Man, there's more material
out there for all of us

250
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:32,517
"Outside of that one project,
that one role a year,

251
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:34,730
"Which has really started to
spark the production company."

252
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:38,610
The desire to create
material, create content,

253
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,650
you know, then that wouldn't be an issue,

254
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,010
and I enjoy seeing somebody's strengths

255
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,330
and trying to help them succeed

256
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,163
and get the things they want.

257
00:08:48,163 --> 00:08:52,987
- And Michael, it's tough to look at you,

258
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,321
coming in all good looking.

259
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,280
[Michael laughs]

260
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,844
That starts a lot of cantankerousness.

261
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:03,180
[Michael laughs]

262
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,310
We even talked about that,
I even told you about that.

263
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,386
- Yeah, you did.

264
00:09:06,386 --> 00:09:09,800
- I said "You're so nice,"

265
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,290
which is rare, 'cause you. 

266
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,310
To be this high in your career,

267
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,990
you know, a little bit of. 

268
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,820
Most people get a little
[beep] sprinkled on that

269
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,070
a little bit, you know?

270
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,199
Some people have a little pocket of [beep]

271
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,230
and they sprinkle it on
themself once they ascend,

272
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,840
you know, they start
talking through people.

273
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,760
You don't do that, which makes it. 

274
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,660
Which makes people even. 

275
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:40,380
Maybe it makes it even
tougher that you are nice,

276
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,520
but I tell you what,

277
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,960
the fact that you have
that way of thinking,

278
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,630
that you want to relieve that tension

279
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,073
is amazing and. 

280
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,440
- I just feel like there's room, man.

281
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,480
I just feel like there's
room, you know, like --

282
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,133
- [Jamie] But you understand that, though.

283
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,420
You understand that when,

284
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,690
and I would say this,

285
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,860
you know, I would tell this to you,

286
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,977
I said "Hey, keep moving.

287
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,277
"Don't worry about all of those things

288
00:10:13,277 --> 00:10:14,110
"and all of those people

289
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,943
"and all of those things

290
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:16,267
"that are trying to get you distracted

291
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,900
"because you've got something special."

292
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,310
And I say, even coming
along with "Just Mercy",

293
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,083
but going back to like,

294
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,997
your narrative in "Fruitvale Station",

295
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,050
is that something that you. 

296
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,130
'Cause now we're looking back,

297
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,730
but is that something that when
you took that type of movie,

298
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,670
was that on purpose?

299
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,620
Meaning like, a narrative for us?

300
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,771
For our culture?

301
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:44,604
For black -- ?

302
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:47,680
- Yeah, that was my first
real intentional move

303
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,170
where I had a choice.

304
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,539
'Cause you know people think
'cause you're an actor,

305
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:55,793
all these roles, you know,
that you're doing, that,

306
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:58,567
"Oh, I had like, 10 choices

307
00:10:58,567 --> 00:10:59,720
and I decided to do that one."

308
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,704
It's like, nah, that's the one I booked!

309
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,613
So that's the one I did!

310
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:04,446
- [Jamie] Right, right.

311
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:06,899
- But I think that was the
first one that I really. 

312
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,750
- [Jamie] And Ryan Coogler.

313
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,460
- And that was beyond, above me,

314
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,293
you know what I'm saying?

315
00:11:13,293 --> 00:11:15,374
That's the universe
putting people together

316
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,330
the way it just worked out,

317
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,720
because Ryan just so happened

318
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,530
to be coming fresh out of USC film school,

319
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,530
you know, kind of his senior project,

320
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,760
you know what I'm saying,

321
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,440
this script that he wrote with me in mind,

322
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,670
that I didn't know at the time,

323
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,750
I was coming back from South Africa,

324
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,080
I had just finished shooting
this movie called "Chronicle".

325
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,787
And I was like,

326
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:39,100
"Man, I wanna do a --"

327
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,933
I was at a crossroads,

328
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:41,990
I said I wanted to do an independent film,

329
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,660
I wanted to do something
that could show I can act,

330
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,950
and I wanna know,

331
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,290
I wanna answer this question myself,

332
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,940
I wanna be able to be a leading man.

333
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,410
You know what I'm saying,
I wanna know if I. 

334
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,370
If that's where I fall.

335
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:53,410
'Cause I know you could
be extremely talented

336
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,166
and not open big movies.

337
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,840
You know what I'm saying?

338
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,180
But I wanted to know where I stood,

339
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,013
where I fell.

340
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,070
But then also,

341
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,540
Trayvon Martin's shooting had happened --

342
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:06,310
- That affected you.

343
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,186
- A month prior, before that.

344
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,060
And I just remember being frustrated,

345
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,460
you know, going online at the time,

346
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,590
it might have been on BlackPlanet,

347
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,423
I don't know what it was, but --

348
00:12:13,423 --> 00:12:15,289
- BlackPlanet!

349
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:16,611
I still have an account!

350
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:17,444
- MySpace or something like that,

351
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:18,553
it was something that was like,

352
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,070
I remember just writing posts, you know,

353
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,133
of how I felt as a black man
or whatever, at the time,

354
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,730
and deleting it, you know what I'm saying,

355
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,200
like, man, I don't even know what to say,

356
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,500
I can't say that, I was too angry,

357
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,418
I said, "I don't know --

358
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:30,297
"How do I express myself?"

359
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:31,700
And I felt frustrated.

360
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,590
So when "Fruitvale", you know,

361
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,000
it was called "Fruitvale" at the time,

362
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,610
when "Fruitvale" came along,

363
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,720
I read it and I was in tears,

364
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,827
and I was like, "Man, this is it.

365
00:12:40,827 --> 00:12:45,137
"This is my way to tell
people how I'm feeling,

366
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:50,050
"to express myself on
hopefully, you know --"

367
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,350
We never knew what the
movie was going to be,

368
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,183
it was like, you know,

369
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:54,907
we shot it for $900,000
and some duct tape.

370
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,207
- Wow. [laughs]

371
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:58,937
- We barely got it made.

372
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:02,980
And I could see if I could
carry a film, you know,

373
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,380
so it checked off all the boxes.

374
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,033
So you know, I met Ryan,

375
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,110
20 minutes into conversation,

376
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,677
just talking with this
brother, I was like,

377
00:13:09,677 --> 00:13:10,870
"Oh, man, this is my guy!"

378
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:11,800
Like if we would've went to school,

379
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,633
if we would've grew up together,

380
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:13,820
he would've been one
of my closest friends,

381
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,760
he would've been one of my best friends,

382
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,390
so we just saw a kinship in one another,

383
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:19,757
and he told me, "Look, Mike," you know,

384
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,327
"I think you're wildly talented,

385
00:13:21,327 --> 00:13:22,507
"Let's go show the world.

386
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:23,340
"Let's go do this."

387
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,173
You know what I mean?

388
00:13:24,173 --> 00:13:25,107
"Let's go tell this story,

389
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:26,700
"I think it's important, let's get it."

390
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,090
And we both was like, "All
right, let's go, let's do it."

391
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,494
- That's great, man, and you know. 

392
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:31,940
- [Michael] And we did.

393
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,660
- And you know what, I
tell you all the time,

394
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,740
when I went and saw that movie,

395
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,730
I took some guys with me, man,

396
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,360
that are very, very tough,
know what I'm saying,

397
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,910
very like, you know, macho,

398
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,661
and then when we watched you
capture us in that performance,

399
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:46,680
I heard sniffles from these guys

400
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,513
and I know it wasn't --

401
00:13:47,513 --> 00:13:48,574
They didn't have a cold!

402
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:49,407
[Michael chuckles]

403
00:13:49,407 --> 00:13:50,290
I'm saying, they was like,

404
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,570
they were broken down with that.

405
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,280
And you know what's interesting about you?

406
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,610
And I'll say this --

407
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,080
I think swag matches swag,

408
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
because you and Ryan have
this sort of coolness

409
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,220
about you guys,

410
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,367
like I think that was. 

411
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,450
That really was the stars lining up.

412
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,880
- Yeah, and you know, to find
a director who understood me,

413
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,390
spoke my language, you
know what I'm saying,

414
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:13,710
same age, liked the same things,

415
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,750
like, our shorthand was incredible,

416
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,440
you know, we had limited time,

417
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,900
we only had the shoot --

418
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,230
and we shot in twenty-one
days, I wanna say,

419
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,650
it was a quick shoot,

420
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,450
and we maximized every take, man,

421
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,530
and I think our relationship

422
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,940
and being able to speak
to one another quickly

423
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,510
and get it really lent itself to that.

424
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,730
And then he brought up "Creed"

425
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,380
before we'd even shot one frame.

426
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,120
He was pitching "Creed"
to MGM before we even

427
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,660
started shooting day one
of "Fruitvale Station".

428
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,359
Yeah, and it was like,

429
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:44,317
"All right, come on, let's do it!"

430
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:45,150
You know what I mean,

431
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,290
so it was the way things
started to line up,

432
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,787
and then right after "Creed", you know,

433
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,170
"Black Panther" came into the mix.

434
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,160
- Slow down, young man, slow
down, you just can't go in

435
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,990
and reference "Creed"
and "Black Panther", man,

436
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,638
Like, you can't go in and go,

437
00:14:59,638 --> 00:15:01,030
"Oh, this is 'Creed' and
this is 'Black Panther',

438
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,407
biggest movie in the world right now,"

439
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:03,440
You can't do that!

440
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,100
First of all, "Creed",

441
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,000
what that did,

442
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,005
what I believe that did,

443
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:11,700
I always looked to love Jones as

444
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,230
a template for me and my
generation who loved Jones,

445
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,063
it was just like,

446
00:15:16,063 --> 00:15:19,880
"Wow, that's black love,
that's universal love."

447
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,340
Anybody that watched said it.

448
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,600
And "Creed",

449
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,003
I was like, "Oh my goodness.

450
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,840
This is so amazing,

451
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,250
the love that you. 

452
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,760
That love story alone
with the iconic person

453
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,660
that you were playing was. "

454
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,200
Speak about that just for a second.

455
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,033
- Nah, it was cool,

456
00:15:40,033 --> 00:15:41,150
it was like one of those things where,

457
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,000
you know, obviously you're
coming from the world of "Rocky",

458
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,453
you know, that franchise and Apollo Creed,

459
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,610
I never transformed my body before,

460
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:51,443
I wanted to, you know,

461
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:53,760
I was gonna challenge that
I wanted to kinda like,

462
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,593
I wanted to see,

463
00:15:54,593 --> 00:15:56,320
yo, you look at, you know,

464
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,640
Sly and Carl Weathers,
you know what I'm saying,

465
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,177
and you know, there were chiseled, man.

466
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:02,481
- Yeah, especially Carl, yeah.

467
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:03,314
Carl's like,

468
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:04,147
"Come on, bro!

469
00:16:04,147 --> 00:16:04,980
"Tap now."

470
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:06,850
- And I was like,

471
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,627
"Man, that's impressive,

472
00:16:08,627 --> 00:16:10,070
"I wanna know if I can do that."

473
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,990
You know, so, we put the time in the gym.

474
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,900
- And then you got the body right.

475
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,770
You didn't do it like me,

476
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,283
like, I have a spank on right now.

477
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:18,840
[Michael laughs]

478
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,820
You didn't spank it out.

479
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,704
This is all spank.

480
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:23,859
Those are muscles. 

481
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:24,830
[elastic band slaps]

482
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,790
Spanks.

483
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,838
- Nah, it was one of those things

484
00:16:26,838 --> 00:16:27,850
where it was just kinda like,

485
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,790
I knew what we were following,

486
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,227
I knew we'd get all the
comparisons to like,

487
00:16:30,227 --> 00:16:31,940
you know, what "Rocky" was,

488
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,650
and we wanted to distinguish
us as our own franchise

489
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,580
and our own story.

490
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,750
You know, Ryan came up with
that entire idea and pitched it

491
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,870
and we finally got everybody on board

492
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,380
and we went out and I think
we executed in a big way

493
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,800
you know, while paying
homage to what Sly built

494
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,140
in the whole "Rocky" world,

495
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,960
we wanted to distinguish,
you know what I'm saying,

496
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,574
what it would be like
told through our lens,

497
00:16:54,574 --> 00:16:56,070
and that's what we wanted to do,

498
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,009
so when "Black Panther"
came along, that was,

499
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:01,220
you know, Killmonger was another narrative

500
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,020
that we wanted to push and
that was a big one, you know,

501
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,810
so our relationship is
very unique, very special.

502
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,959
- Well, from "Fruitvale Station",

503
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:12,410
a small movie that won our hearts

504
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,950
and then to go to the
biggest movie in the world

505
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,339
in "Black Panther" playing Killmonger,

506
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,479
still having the same narrative

507
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,817
that we could feed off of it now,

508
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:23,810
"Just Mercy", I have to say
is, I say it all the time,

509
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,140
we are so appreciative of you

510
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,670
in keeping that narrative alive.

511
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,403
- They convicted an innocent man.

512
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,810
I was always taught to fight for

513
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,710
the people who need the help the most.

514
00:17:35,871 --> 00:17:38,510
- You don't know what it is down here.

515
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,260
They ain't got to have no evidence.

516
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,090
- How many of you all were
with Walter that morning?

517
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,170
- You ain't quitting, is you?

518
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,210
- No, sir.

519
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,360
- In front of and behind the camera,

520
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,850
you were absolutely amazing.

521
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,300
Talk about the birth of "Just Mercy",

522
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,553
how'd that come about?

523
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:01,490
- It was, you know, my agent
kind of brought this up,

524
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,720
it was booked to me and was like,

525
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,460
this is something that I want you to read

526
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,090
and figure out if it's something you think

527
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:09,190
you could wrap your head around.

528
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:12,100
And I was a little bit embarrassed,

529
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,810
once I started to find
out more information

530
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,110
about who Bryan Stevenson was,

531
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,040
'cause I was like, why
don't I know this guy?

532
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,670
Why isn't he more of a household name?

533
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:21,430
Why isn't his work, is incredible,

534
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:25,270
and what he's doing is
exactly what is the remedy

535
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,360
to my frustrations as a young black man,

536
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,220
dealing with all these
issues of police brutality

537
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,780
and mass incarceration of
unfair citizens on death row

538
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,873
and the whole situation, so it was. 

539
00:18:36,873 --> 00:18:38,330
I got a chance to watch his TED Talk,

540
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,660
listen to him speak,

541
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,310
a chance to meet him a few times,

542
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:43,770
and I was blown away,

543
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,320
I was intimidated actually,

544
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,340
because he's much more. 

545
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:51,020
I thought he was much better
of a person than I was,

546
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,853
so I was like,

547
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:52,686
man, I gotta get my life --

548
00:18:52,686 --> 00:18:53,519
I gotta do better.

549
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,352
I gotta try harder,

550
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:56,640
'cause this guy dedicated
his life to a cause

551
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,190
and he's continued to beat
that drum roll of justice,

552
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,073
so that all happened, and you know,

553
00:19:05,806 --> 00:19:08,590
so I met him, signed on to do it,

554
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,130
you know, I think he was
feeling me out to see if

555
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,340
I was worthy enough to play him.

556
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,787
- I'm sure he was absolutely happy

557
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,330
that Michael B. Jordan was playing him.

558
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,890
Bryan Stevenson's a lawyer who. 

559
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:20,030
Explain --

560
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,990
- Bryan Stevenson's a
lawyer who started the EJI,

561
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,070
Equal Justice Initiative,

562
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:26,360
who fights for wrongly accused

563
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,610
and unfair sentenced
black and brown people

564
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,590
for poor disfavor,

565
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,080
you know, people that have been condemned,

566
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,240
he works to get them exonerated

567
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,060
and he fights for just the writing

568
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,450
of a racially-biased judicial system.

569
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,751
- Right.

570
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:46,940
- So I had the honor of playing him.

571
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,730
So anyway, that got that together,

572
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,400
me and Destin Cretton,
director of "Short Term 12",

573
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,750
a friend of Ryan's,

574
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,943
we started cracking together a script,

575
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,890
trying to develop the stories
out of this huge memoir,

576
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,750
it was so many and so much material

577
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,583
and I'm trying to figure out

578
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,640
how do we make this into a two-hour film?

579
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,909
So we start to pull stories

580
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:10,700
and work on it over the next couple years,

581
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,210
this is about, you know, three
to four years in the making,

582
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,430
and then we started to
get down to studios,

583
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,180
who's gonna distribute this thing,

584
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,530
Warner Brothers stepped
up in a really big way,

585
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,493
we started thinking about cast,

586
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,591
the case of Walter McMillan,

587
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:28,460
what the movie's kind of based around

588
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,810
and being in a position
as one of the producers,

589
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,770
you know, I felt. 

590
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,700
I knew what would knock it out of the park

591
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,540
somebody, you know, who screamed his name,

592
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,990
was you know, it was you, you know,

593
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,050
my mentor and big brother,

594
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,560
somebody who I consider
on the Mount Rushmore,

595
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,990
one of the GOAT's in the game,

596
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,770
along with Brie Larson, you know,

597
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,540
Rob Morgan and O'Shea Jackson

598
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,030
and Karan Kendrick and Tim Blake Nelson,

599
00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,630
many other talented
cast that came together

600
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,080
to help make this thing come about.

601
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,727
The movie is. 

602
00:21:04,727 --> 00:21:08,073
I'm really, really proud
of, you know, in a lot ways,

603
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,060
it was one of the first
films under Warner Brothers'

604
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,020
adopted the inclusion rider,

605
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,910
along with my production company.

606
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,150
We helped write the inclusion rider

607
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,270
that all of Warner media
actually hires under,

608
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,470
so all their companies
under their umbrella

609
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:30,300
uses are inclusion act, as well.

610
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,100
So everybody knew this
story was very important

611
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,483
from the studio to the director, clearly,

612
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:38,020
all the way down to the P.A.'s,

613
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,710
it was a production that
was a very diverse crew

614
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,440
and everybody knew how important it was,

615
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,040
so everybody went the extra mile

616
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,293
to make sure the story was right.

617
00:21:51,162 --> 00:21:53,480
- Well, I was absolutely
honored and humbled

618
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,290
to get that call to play
this character, man,

619
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:59,466
and I thank you again, like,

620
00:21:59,466 --> 00:22:02,537
our personal conversation is basically,

621
00:22:02,537 --> 00:22:04,310
you've given me opportunities to have

622
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,180
my artistic integrity back and in tact,

623
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,450
and to hear the story of
this Walter McMillan person

624
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,190
who was wrongly accused of. 

625
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:21,500
In Alabama, coming from
his job as a tree-poping,

626
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:23,790
owning, chopping down trees,

627
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,320
he's wrongly accused of killing someone

628
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,230
in a city that he'd never been in

629
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,730
and just so a matter of fact,

630
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,510
they put him in jail and
they put him on death row.

631
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,170
I thought that, "wow, I'm in,"

632
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:39,390
we both speaked on this,

633
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,670
because it's so necessary

634
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:41,503
and even today,

635
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:42,720
even though this was 30 years ago,

636
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,303
1986 or '87, whenever it was,

637
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:50,330
those types of things are still going on,

638
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,550
like, there's a case in Texas

639
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,640
and so many other places

640
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,980
and I just thought I was in with both feet

641
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,700
and then putting Walter McMillan,

642
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,203
putting the skin on him,

643
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,960
having a father who had
been to jail himself

644
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,450
for $25 worth of illegal substance,

645
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:10,790
I drew upon that.

646
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,940
I remember when we had
to shoot those scenes

647
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,700
in the jail cell,

648
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,910
on how I felt when they
were putting cuffs on me,

649
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,290
and I'm a person of perception.

650
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,240
I don't like the perception
of seeing anybody in jail

651
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,590
but I knew those. 

652
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,450
Just like, getting the
cuffs on really put me

653
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,337
in the mindset of like,

654
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:34,990
"Wow, this person's life
is put upside down."

655
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,350
His family, everybody's affected

656
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,398
and then all of a sudden,

657
00:23:38,398 --> 00:23:40,640
an angel of a person,

658
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,823
Bryan Stevenson, played by you,

659
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,670
it was just magical on set.

660
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,120
It's such a necessary story

661
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,227
and I applaud you for
bringing that to everybody.

662
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,363
- I appreciate it.

663
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,273
I think it's important, you know,

664
00:23:57,273 --> 00:24:02,273
it's a movie that will take
you through a range of emotions

665
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,860
and hopefully you end up feeling,

666
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,210
you know, walking out of the theater

667
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,740
when you get finished watching it,

668
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,210
that you wanna feel like

669
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,370
you wanna be a part of the solution,

670
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,840
I want this to inspire conversation

671
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,390
and to provoke thought and to. 

672
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,730
Sometimes the criminal justice system is

673
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:25,390
such a big issue that it
almost paralyzes a person

674
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,020
to not wanting to do anything

675
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,853
you know, it's just like,

676
00:24:27,853 --> 00:24:30,050
"What can I do to affect this big thing,

677
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,380
so I'm just going to do nothing,"

678
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,050
and I think that's the
wrong perspective to have.

679
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:35,977
You can do something.

680
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:38,810
You know, voting is extremely important,

681
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,180
to educate yourself,

682
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,850
what prosecutors in your local community,

683
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,123
who are they, you know?

684
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,580
What policies are being
put in place, you know?

685
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,960
All the information's at your fingertips,

686
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,130
you just gotta do a
little bit of inquiring

687
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,100
about certain things just
so you can be knowledgeable,

688
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,900
so you can learn how your
vote can directly affect

689
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,890
your circumstances and your environment.

690
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,630
So yeah, there's a million things,

691
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,833
you go on to EJI.org,

692
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,740
Bryan Stevenson is
setting up this, you know,

693
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,600
a lot of actionable things on his website

694
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,860
that you can do if you
feel some move to do so,

695
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,210
but I heard you say it a million times,

696
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,640
the things that we go online about,

697
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,810
the things that we talk about,

698
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:19,680
all these issues,

699
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,060
all these injustices that are happening

700
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,261
that we go on social media

701
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:24,400
and we have these rants

702
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,338
and we have these revolutions

703
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:30,300
and we're emotionally reacting.

704
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,290
And then we get distracted,

705
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,170
and 30 minutes later,

706
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,530
we're on to the next thing and the next,

707
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,870
whatever it is, you know,

708
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,360
all the things that we're talking about,

709
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,060
you know, Bryan Stevenson is
actively fighting everyday.

710
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,820
So, you know, I think this
is a all hands on deck,

711
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,540
as you say, this is a --

712
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,920
Everybody needs to get involved

713
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,820
and do whatever they
can to see this movie.

714
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,200
You know, outside of the movie,

715
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,033
it's what it represents.

716
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,930
- Yeah, but it, absolutely,
people need to see it

717
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,890
because it's special.

718
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:01,854
And I wanna jump into this
one particular situation

719
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:06,854
when you embody Bryan Stevenson
absolutely incredibly,

720
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,700
but the scene in the courtroom,

721
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,270
I talk about this all
the time specifically,

722
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,120
because I think this is so important,

723
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,480
the scene of you in the courtroom,

724
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,610
this wonderful speech

725
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,790
that I watched you craft

726
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,460
and it was so important,

727
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,270
why was. 

728
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,910
You've said in interviews
that that speech,

729
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:32,100
you looked in the script

730
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,410
and you went straight to that speech like,

731
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,670
this is the most important thing

732
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,130
and I absolutely agree with you.

733
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,130
Talk of that.

734
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:41,850
- I think because the. 

735
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,440
You know, as an actor,
you'd look through a script

736
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,930
and there's certain scenes
that you just circle,

737
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,560
that's like, "okay, I can't
wait to get that one."

738
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,290
It was a pivotal moment in the movie,

739
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,710
it was a pivotal moment
in Walter McMillan's case,

740
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,133
everything was kind of
resting on this argument,

741
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,523
and I wanted to get it right so bad.

742
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,100
I think it's important because. 

743
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:06,720
It really goes into the human condition,

744
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,230
it really goes into how we're viewed,

745
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,660
it goes into the perception

746
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,900
that people have on people of color,

747
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,290
people that look like us.

748
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:19,240
And then we can't be a fair system,

749
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,660
we can't be a system
that calls ourselves just

750
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:25,470
if we treat people that
are rich and guilty

751
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,177
different than if you're
poor and innocent.

752
00:27:27,177 --> 00:27:28,010
- Wow.

753
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:32,900
- So Bryan Stevenson is
very good at being reserved,

754
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,303
at being methodical,

755
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:37,010
at being strategic,

756
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,000
but in this one scene,

757
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,020
you saw him kind of
take all of his strategy

758
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,490
and kind of just ball it into one,

759
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,213
and it ultimately helped,

760
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,560
helped get Walter McMillan's
case a return, so. 

761
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,940
- That, to me, that speech was amazing,

762
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,680
and I'm just gonna tell you as a fan,

763
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,430
watching you walk that speech down,

764
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,980
oh, you finished that speech,

765
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,730
and what you didn't see behind you was. 

766
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,830
The extras in this courtroom
gave you a standing ovation.

767
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,451
I went to congratulate you,

768
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:19,910
it was like, as we say in church,

769
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,810
you had the holy ghost,

770
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:22,410
you had the spirit,

771
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,360
and you walked out.

772
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,550
Oh, I texted you and told you

773
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,680
that it was an amazing performance,

774
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:32,280
the people in the fourth row are weeping,

775
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,210
and then. 

776
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:36,050
and then all of a sudden,

777
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:41,010
the movie is being seen by
people for the first time,

778
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,390
in the biggest way,

779
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,060
at the Toronto Film Festival,

780
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,630
which is, I mean, for
those of you watching,

781
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,923
that's like our Superbowl in a sense,

782
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,307
and I whispered to you, I said,

783
00:28:53,307 --> 00:28:55,980
"Hey, man, you gon' be
surprised when people see this,

784
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,750
on how they react."

785
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,890
And we walked out on that stage

786
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,130
after the movie had just
been seen in Toronto,

787
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,530
and when you walked out,

788
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,750
they're giving you a standing ovation.

789
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,000
How'd that make you feel?

790
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,233
- Yeah, humbled, man, honored, honestly.

791
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:14,210
You know, we put so much into this movie,

792
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,420
we put so much into making it,

793
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,510
we knew how important it was

794
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,150
but you never really know exactly

795
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,390
how people are going to react to it,

796
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,480
so when you see people
appreciate the work. 

797
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,320
And one of the biggest
things I took away from that

798
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,650
was the Q&A we had after,

799
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,697
the questions people were asking was,

800
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:29,747
"What could I do?"

801
00:29:29,747 --> 00:29:31,144
"How do I make a difference?"

802
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,047
"Where do I sign up?"

803
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:33,880
"What's going on?"

804
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,060
"I feel some type of way,"

805
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,774
and that confirmed that we had something

806
00:29:37,774 --> 00:29:38,647
that was gonna make people think

807
00:29:38,647 --> 00:29:40,570
and make people start
having conversations,

808
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,450
so, you know, the voice of
the people is very powerful.

809
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,500
The people that spoke,

810
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,450
and there's a phrase that goes back to,

811
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,860
you know, the beginning of time,

812
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,080
so you know, we collectively
get together about something

813
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,650
and then we want to see a change,

814
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:56,490
we can demand it,

815
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,740
so hopefully they feel passionate
about the subject enough

816
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,750
that they want to demand
some type of change.

817
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,583
- That's great.

818
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:05,680
I'm gonna call you Santa Claus, brother,

819
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,440
because you have given us a gift,

820
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,250
everybody go out and see "Just Mercy",

821
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,590
I'm happy to be a part of it,

822
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,633
in January.

823
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,843
- Open out wide.

824
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:15,037
- Open out wide.

825
00:30:15,037 --> 00:30:16,000
"Just Mercy".

826
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,833
- Boss.

827
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:18,719
- Boss?

828
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:19,586
- Yeah, I had to.

829
00:30:19,586 --> 00:30:21,074
[Jamie laughs]

830
00:30:21,074 --> 00:30:22,556
I just had to.

831
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:24,372
I'm still [laughing drowns out Michael]

832
00:30:24,372 --> 00:30:27,122
[Michael laughs]
