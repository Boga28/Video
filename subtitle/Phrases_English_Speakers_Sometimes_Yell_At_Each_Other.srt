1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,983
Believe it or not,

2
00:00:00,983 --> 00:00:03,920
English speakers sometimes
yell at each other.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,890
Sometimes we want to say
something loudly and clearly,

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,790
or with a little bit of emotion.

5
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:10,900
Quit it.

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,920
Sometimes we, cut it out.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,350
Sometimes when we're trying, stop it.

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,630
Sometimes we're trying to make a point,

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,800
we say things very clearly
and directly to people.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,400
Again, we say these when
we're speaking with emotion.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,310
We say these, when we
want to speak loudly,

12
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:32,369
because someone is far away,

13
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,650
or we say these in a way that
just communicates strongly

14
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:36,770
what we're feeling.

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,160
So stick around for this English lesson,

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,210
where I'll explain to
you a number of phrases

17
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,660
that you can use in English

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,920
when you want to speak clearly,

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,058
loudly, and maybe yell a bit.

20
00:00:46,058 --> 00:00:48,725
(bouncy music)

21
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,720
Well, hello and welcome
to this English lesson

22
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,580
where I'm going to teach you how to yell

23
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,460
at other people in English.

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,340
Remember when you yell at other people,

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,250
it's not always considered polite.

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,849
So just be careful if you do
use some of these phrases.

27
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:05,910
Before we get started, though,

28
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,290
if this is your first time here,

29
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,820
don't forget to click that red
subscribe button over there,

30
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,740
and give me a thumbs up

31
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,890
if this video helps you learn

32
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,400
just a little bit more English.

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,760
So right now there's a whole
bunch of flies around me,

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,210
and they are bothering me.

35
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,770
They are bugging me.

36
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,110
If a person was here,

37
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,620
and they were bugging me,
or bothering me as well,

38
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:25,950
there's three English phrases we could use

39
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,350
to tell them to go away.

40
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,770
We can say, leave me alone, leave me be,

41
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,440
or the most forceful one, get lost.

42
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,820
So all of these phrases you would use

43
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,840
in a situation where something
like a fly is bothering you.

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,680
You might say, ah, leave me alone.

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,040
Or ah, leave me be, or get lost.

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,750
You might even say get lost, fly.

47
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,330
In fact, I yelled that this morning

48
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,210
when I was working on my computer.

49
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,210
These are phrases you
would use to tell someone,

50
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,020
and it would be kind of rude to say this,

51
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,720
or something that you
want them to go away.

52
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,560
You do not want them to be in
the same area where you are.

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,660
Sometimes when I'm driving in my van,

54
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,250
my kids are in the back, and
sometimes they're really loud.

55
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,180
And there's two things you
could yell in that situation.

56
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,780
One would be really
rude, and not very nice.

57
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,860
It wouldn't be nice for me
as a parent to yell, shut up,

58
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:20,090
but it would be something
that would be used

59
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,290
to tell people that you
want them to be quiet.

60
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,410
It's probably more likely
that I would say zip it.

61
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,640
I would probably say to my
kids, hey, zip it back there.

62
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,090
I'm trying to focus on my driving,

63
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,310
and all of the noise that you are making

64
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,290
is very, very distracting.

65
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,600
So in English, if you
wanted to yell something

66
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,790
to someone or a bunch of people,

67
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,530
because you wanted them to be quiet,

68
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,350
if you wanted something rude,
you could yell, shut up.

69
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,800
And if you wanted something
that's a little more friendly,

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,940
but still communicates
what you're trying to say.

71
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,680
You could say zip it.

72
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,120
I just said zip it to
my kids the other day.

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,720
We were in a traffic jam.

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,550
It was stop and go traffic,

75
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,450
and I really needed to concentrate.

76
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,950
And so I ended up saying to my kids,

77
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,650
hey, just zip it for a
little bit back there.

78
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,720
Dad is trying to concentrate.

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,060
As you can see, someone
is poking me with a stick,

80
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,760
and this is a little bit annoying.

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,240
This is aggravating.

82
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,280
If I wanted to yell at the
person who's doing this

83
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,350
that I wanted them to stop,

84
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,450
I would use the same three phrases

85
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,970
that you heard me use at
the beginning of the video.

86
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,700
I might say, quit it.

87
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,440
I might say, stop it.

88
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,520
Or I might say, cut it out.

89
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,002
All of those phrases
communicate to a person

90
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,140
that you want them to stop
doing what they're doing.

91
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,370
If you aren't comfortable yelling though,

92
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,290
because yelling is a little bit rude,

93
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,640
you can actually add the word please

94
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,170
at the beginning of a
couple of these phrases.

95
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,250
In a calm voice, you
could say, please stop it.

96
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,030
In a calm voice, you could
say, please cut it out.

97
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,700
But if you're really, really annoyed,

98
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,730
if it's really, really bothering you,

99
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,440
you would probably yell stop it,

100
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,700
or you would yell, cut it out.

101
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,660
Have you ever been using the bathroom,

102
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,560
and then realize that you
forgot to lock the door?

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,580
And then all of the sudden you
see the door start to open,

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,860
and someone's foot comes through the door

105
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,740
as they start to enter the room.

106
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,980
There are two phrases

107
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,040
that you should immediately
yell in English.

108
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,220
You should yell, get
out, or get out of here.

109
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,360
They both mean exactly the same thing,

110
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,230
and they will communicate to the person

111
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,230
that you want them to
stop entering the room,

112
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,450
and exit the room instead.

113
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,450
These two phrases, get
out and get out of here,

114
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,830
are phrases we yell in English when,

115
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,920
if we're in a place with someone else,

116
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,330
and we want them to leave.

117
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,950
And we want to communicate that strongly,

118
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,240
or like in the bathroom situation.

119
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,920
If someone is entering a
space where you want privacy,

120
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,220
you could yell, get
out, or get out of here.

121
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,380
In the case of the bathroom,

122
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,620
you should yell it
clearly, and forcefully,

123
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,960
and as quickly as possible,

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,700
because that would certainly be

125
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,770
a very embarrassing situation.

126
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:58,170
In life, we expect adults
to behave like adults.

127
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,100
We expect teenagers to
behave like teenagers,

128
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,400
but sometimes adults and
teenagers behave like children.

129
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,100
Sometimes they do things
that are childish.

130
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,560
In that situation, the phrase
you would yell at them,

131
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,340
if you were annoyed, would be grow up.

132
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,240
When we yell at someone
in English, grow up,

133
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,470
what we're saying is that

134
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,950
we think the way they are acting

135
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,830
is not appropriate for their age.

136
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,320
Little children sometimes
repeat what other people say

137
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,290
to be funny.

138
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,730
Sometimes at the supper table,

139
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,290
my youngest child will start to say

140
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,960
everything that everyone else says

141
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,360
immediately after they say it.

142
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,840
And it's kind of funny.

143
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,330
When adults do this, if I
went to a family reunion,

144
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,210
and my brother started to
repeat everything I said,

145
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,150
after I said it,

146
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,820
I would probably say,
grow up, stop doing that.

147
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,560
It's really, really annoying.

148
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,510
So if people act in a way

149
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,560
that you think is not
appropriate for their age,

150
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,970
you could say to them, or yell
at them in English, grow up.

151
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,160
Have you ever been ready to go somewhere,

152
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,660
but the people who are
going with you aren't ready?

153
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,700
Well, there's two phrases

154
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,920
you could yell in English to express this.

155
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,410
You could yell, come on, and
you could yell, let's go.

156
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,050
When you yell these phrases,

157
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,430
you're encouraging the
other people to hurry up,

158
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,550
to speed up, to get ready faster,

159
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,100
because you're ready to go.

160
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,460
I'm not going to comment

161
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,780
whether this happens in my family or not.

162
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,030
All I will say is that

163
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,500
I have used both these phrases recently,

164
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,660
and I've used them in exactly this manner.

165
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,920
I have yelled come on,
and I've yelled, let's go

166
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,460
to people who were going

167
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,360
to be going somewhere with
me, because I was ready,

168
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,370
I was in the van, and I was ready to go.

169
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,530
So come on, and let's go,

170
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,740
two phrases you can use

171
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,010
to communicate to other
people that you want them

172
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,370
to hurry up, because
you're ready to leave.

173
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,203
Well, there you go.

174
00:06:46,203 --> 00:06:48,310
A few phrases that you can use in English

175
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,510
when you want to yell and
express how you are feeling,

176
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,960
or when you just need to yell,

177
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,750
so someone who's far away
from you can hear you.

178
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,010
Thank you so much for watching.

179
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,580
If this is your first time here,

180
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,010
don't forget to click that red
subscribe button over there,

181
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,870
and give me a thumbs up

182
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,170
if this video helped you learn

183
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,550
just a little bit more English.

184
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,920
And if you have some time,

185
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,150
why don't you stick around,

186
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,129
and watch another English lesson?
