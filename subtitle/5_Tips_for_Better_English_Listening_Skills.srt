1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,091
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:07,628
Today's lesson is going to focus on five tips to improve

3
00:00:07,628 --> 00:00:09,796
your English listening skills.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,475
So often we focus on speaking, don't we? But listening,

5
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:18,858
understanding someone else is just as important if you want to

6
00:00:18,858 --> 00:00:21,167
be able to communicate effectively, right?

7
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:26,143
What makes listening so hard is that the English that you hear

8
00:00:26,143 --> 00:00:29,610
is often quite different to the English that you learn.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,491
So I want to share five different techniques that you can use

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,847
to improve your listening skills.

11
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:38,165
Perhaps you've already tried a few of them,

12
00:00:38,165 --> 00:00:41,360
maybe some of them are new. I definitely hope

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,959
that you can take a couple of new ideas away

14
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:46,702
and put them into practice after this video.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,991
When I was preparing for this lesson I asked the members inside

16
00:00:55,991 --> 00:01:00,357
my English speaking community Hey Lady! about what they

17
00:01:00,357 --> 00:01:04,132
feared most when it comes to listening to someone

18
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,600
speaking English, what were the things that worried the most

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,840
and I got lots of different responses

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,460
but the top three were: Not being able to understand words,

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,837
maybe slang, people talking too fast

22
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:20,936
so of course, that includes linking,

23
00:01:20,936 --> 00:01:23,393
contractions and reduced forms.

24
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:28,467
Thirdly, not being familiar with or comfortable with the accent.

25
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,626
What do you think? Do you agree?

26
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:33,988
What worries you the most when you have to listen to someone

27
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:37,662
who is speaking in English? Let me know down in the comments.

28
00:01:38,285 --> 00:01:42,712
Listening to people is something that we do all of the time.

29
00:01:42,712 --> 00:01:46,680
You're listening to me right now. We listen to podcasts,

30
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,951
we listen to TV shows and movies.

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,864
All of this is passive listening, you're absorbing the sounds

32
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:56,183
and the words, taking what you know

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,312
and understanding it, interpreting it.

34
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:02,242
But today I really want to talk about

35
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:06,592
 how you can practise and how you can improve

36
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:10,689
your listening skills so that you can feel more confident joining

37
00:02:10,689 --> 00:02:13,359
conversations and meeting new people and

38
00:02:13,359 --> 00:02:15,316
communicating in English.

39
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,219
First up, pronunciation.

40
00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:21,195
One of the best things that you can do to improve your listening

41
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:24,231
skills is to study pronunciation

42
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,408
but I'm not really talking about

43
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:29,831
learning and practising individual sounds

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,707
but rather focusing on the elements of naturally spoken English.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,759
Things like contractions, reduced forms, sentence stress,

46
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,446
intonation, all of these things, learning to hear and recognise

47
00:02:46,446 --> 00:02:49,940
the sounds of English as it's actually spoken

48
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,964
because English doesn't always sound like what you expect,

49
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:57,768
does it? Sounds blend together, they change, 

50
00:02:57,768 --> 00:03:00,223
sometimes they're completely dropped.

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,080
And it's no wonder that your poor little brain is  

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,734
crying out for help as you're listening to someone speaking English

53
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:13,973
and it's no wonder that you tend to blame your ears and yourself

54
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,983
for not being able to hear and understand the sounds

55
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:21,061
but it's not your fault. You haven't been taught

56
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:25,614
to hear 'What do you want to do?'

57
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:28,002
that's what you expect to hear, isn't it?

58
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:31,114
What you actually hear is something like:

59
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,829
Whaddaya wannado?

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,647
Learning to recognise these sounds and to start associating

61
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:44,884
those sounds with the words 'what do you want to do'

62
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:46,255
is gonna help

63
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:49,810
right and I have the perfect video to help you practise,

64
00:03:49,943 --> 00:03:53,678
the thirty most common reductions in English.

65
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:57,160
The link is up here and I'll add it to the end of the video

66
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,367
but if you study and learn the sounds of naturally spoken English,

67
00:04:02,456 --> 00:04:06,878
you're going to be in a much better position to actually understand

68
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:08,465
spoken English.

69
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:12,237
Next up is reading and listening together.

70
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,579
Now this really shouldn't be a new idea because I talk

71
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:19,159
about it all of the time. It is one of my favourite techniques

72
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:23,494
to help you improve your pronunciation which I just explained

73
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:25,200
is an excellent way to help

74
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,567
you improve your listening skills, right?

75
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,484
With this technique, you get to see the word as you read

76
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:34,645
and you also get to hear it as it's being spoken.

77
00:04:34,645 --> 00:04:36,297
So you start to recognise

78
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:38,887
the sounds and associate it to the words.

79
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:43,288
Hey quick question. Do you use Ted Talks at all when you study

80
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:45,262
and you practise your English?

81
00:04:45,262 --> 00:04:48,606
Ted Talks are brilliant resources to help you with your

82
00:04:48,606 --> 00:04:50,324
listening skills in English.

83
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,390
If you go to their website, every video has an interactive transcript

84
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,348
and that transcript allows you to follow the script

85
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:03,351
as the speaker is talking so it's great for learning new words,

86
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,687
it's great for hearing the natural pronunciation

87
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:12,472
and you can even use it to pause and to practise imitating

88
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:16,587
what the speaker is saying. Ted Talks are also a really awesome

89
00:05:16,587 --> 00:05:20,046
way to listen to different types of English speakers

90
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:23,723
because there are so many different talks that you can listen to.

91
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,725
Listening to those different voices, different accents,

92
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:32,139
different paces, all of this is essential to helping you develop

93
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,474
your listening skills.

94
00:05:33,963 --> 00:05:37,869
So this is my third tip, listening to different accents,

95
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,907
different voices and in different contexts.

96
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,080
Opening yourself up to different voices and

97
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,764
different accents is so important.

98
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:52,944
It's not only about accents but it's also the tone of people's voice,

99
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:57,919
the pace at which they speak and then of course, the context

100
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,449
in which you're listening, background noise,

101
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:04,564
maybe you're really comfortable talking one-to-one

102
00:06:04,653 --> 00:06:07,639
but when there's a group and there's multiple people talking,

103
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,188
they're talking over the top of each other

104
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:12,093
it becomes more challenging.

105
00:06:12,093 --> 00:06:15,739
So we have all of these different features to play with.

106
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:20,018
Playing with the difference in all of these experiences is something

107
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:24,000
that will help you to develop really strong listening skills.

108
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:28,389
Now if you choose to listen to different voices,

109
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,596
it may be a little harder at the beginning.

110
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,724
It's definitely going to be something that pays off

111
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:36,619
for you in the long run because you're going to be able to

112
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,188
understand more people

113
00:06:38,344 --> 00:06:44,206
and you'll feel less fearful as you meet people who have an accent

114
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:46,898
or a tone of voice that you're not familiar with.

115
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:50,790
So how do you know when you should look for a different accent

116
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,608
or a different type of person to listen to?

117
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:56,696
When you're listening to someone, maybe you're listening to me

118
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:59,895
right now and you're feeling really good.

119
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,737
I can understand most of what she's saying.

120
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,061
I feel relaxed and comfortable.

121
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:07,983
I'm kind of pleased with myself actually.

122
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,285
Well this is a sign, it's a sign that's telling you

123
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:14,421
you need to shake things up a bit.

124
00:07:14,621 --> 00:07:19,228
If you're feeling comfortable, then you know it's time to push

125
00:07:19,228 --> 00:07:21,338
the boundary of your comfort zone a little.

126
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,053
Not a lot, let's not go crazy but a little.

127
00:07:26,053 --> 00:07:30,374
And when you feel a little bit of discomfort or that fear

128
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,485
when you start talking to someone and you realise

129
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:36,579
that their accent is quite different

130
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:40,178
or maybe they're speaking really quickly, you just want to notice

131
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:43,094
that fear, that resistance that you have

132
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,154
of not being able to understand someone you're worried about it.

133
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:52,200
That is telling you that this is the type of situation that you need

134
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,031
practice with. The more you listen to someone,

135
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:57,708
the more you understand of them, right?

136
00:07:57,708 --> 00:08:01,592
So again Ted Talks are really great tools to help you with this

137
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:05,889
because people who are presenting, they're often speaking a little

138
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,774
more clearly. You have the transcript to help you practise with

139
00:08:09,774 --> 00:08:14,569
and you get to ease into different accents, different paces,

140
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:15,941
different tones.

141
00:08:15,941 --> 00:08:18,035
Let's get on to my next tip.

142
00:08:18,035 --> 00:08:20,496
Write what you hear.

143
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:23,858
This is my absolute favourite one. I can't wait to share it.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,190
So we're not talking about sitting down to a YouTube video

145
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,277
and writing out the entire thing, everything that you hear.

146
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,821
That is not going to work, it's not going to be fun.

147
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:36,063
It's going to take you a bloody long time.

148
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,490
So I have some really specific steps

149
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,238
to follow if you want to practise along in this way.

150
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:46,083
Step one is choose a really small section of a video,

151
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:48,200
a podcast or a Ted Talk,

152
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,139
just thirty seconds only.

153
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:55,034
Step two is just listening to that section a couple of times.

154
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,826
You're not writing yet, you're just listening,

155
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:01,951
you're getting used to their accent, you're getting used to the tone

156
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,935
and the pace of their voice.

157
00:09:03,935 --> 00:09:07,670
You're also becoming more familiar with the topic or the context

158
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,245
of the conversation.

159
00:09:09,512 --> 00:09:10,680
Step three.

160
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,962
Okay now you're ready to pick up your pen and to write.

161
00:09:15,363 --> 00:09:17,887
So you want to listen to the first sentence,

162
00:09:18,221 --> 00:09:20,841
pause, write down what you hear.

163
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:24,071
Listen to the next sentence, pause,

164
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,830
write down what you hear.

165
00:09:26,008 --> 00:09:30,006
Now you may want to slow down the speed of the audio a little.

166
00:09:30,006 --> 00:09:33,995
It's really easy to do that with Ted Talks, with Audible

167
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:37,761
and on YouTube. We really don't want to make this an impossible

168
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:40,824
task. If slowing down the speed a little

169
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:42,641
helps you to get through the practice

170
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,723
there is no harm in doing that at all.

171
00:09:46,012 --> 00:09:49,727
So what about when you don't quite catch something,

172
00:09:49,972 --> 00:09:53,671
maybe there's a word that you don't recognise, you don't know the

173
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:57,476
meaning of, you can't recognise it, maybe the sounds

174
00:09:57,476 --> 00:09:59,789
have kind of all squished together

175
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:02,512
and so it doesn't make a lot of sense to you.

176
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:06,584
That's fine, leave a gap, keep listening,

177
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:08,938
write down what you do hear.

178
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:12,191
Do this all the way through to the end of that little section

179
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:13,761
that you're listening to

180
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,539
and go back to the start, listen again,

181
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:22,354
try to fill in some of those gaps. Look at the words around the gap.

182
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:24,747
Can you try and guess what could go there

183
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:26,582
or what should go there?

184
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:31,625
So tell me, what is so great about this really simple technique

185
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,247
to help you improve your listening skills?

186
00:10:34,469 --> 00:10:35,703
Any ideas?

187
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:39,435
Unlike all of the other tips that I've shared today,

188
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:44,566
this one helps you to actually discover what you're not hearing.

189
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:48,609
When you're listening, you are always taking in information.

190
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:51,618
You're taking in everything that you understand

191
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,565
and you're leaving the rest behind

192
00:10:54,565 --> 00:10:58,132
but the parts that you don't understand, they're the parts

193
00:10:58,132 --> 00:11:00,954
that are going to help you to learn and to grow.

194
00:11:01,154 --> 00:11:04,670
So filling in those gaps is going to help you to understand

195
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,800
and it's going to help you to improve your listening skills.

196
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,630
And lastly, watch without subtitles.

197
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,280
Okay quick poll.

198
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:19,262
Who watches movies or TV shows without any subtitles?

199
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:22,958
Answer honestly here. I really genuinely want to know.

200
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,785
Share it down in the comments.

201
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:29,394
Watching a movie or a TV show in a language that you're learning

202
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:32,177
without subtitles is really hard work

203
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:36,811
especially if you're sitting down to do it at the end of a long day,

204
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:38,922
you're sitting down to watch your favourite show,

205
00:11:38,922 --> 00:11:40,808
you just want to relax.

206
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:45,876
Yes watching without subtitles is harder. It's going to teach you 

207
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:49,315
how to listen. When you listen to people in real life,

208
00:11:49,315 --> 00:11:54,247
there are no subtitles right, there are no captions in real life

209
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:57,891
so we have to build that confidence and that awareness

210
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,216
with our listening skills.

211
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:04,114
You've got your favourite TV show, you have a notebook handy,

212
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,395
you've got it sitting next to you on the couch

213
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:10,055
just so every time you sit down to turn on the telly

214
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,470
you've got it there ready.

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,418
You want to turn off the subtitles and start paying attention.

216
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,329
Remember we're just focusing on the first one minute,

217
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:21,707
when you watch that one minute through,

218
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,958
pause,

219
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:27,514
take out that notebook and write down a few notes about

220
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:33,205
what you saw or what you heard in the first minute of that video.

221
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:35,925
So, for example, you might write something about

222
00:12:35,925 --> 00:12:37,223
one of the characters.

223
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,803
Paul seemed really frustrated by

224
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:43,776
Annie's decision to book a holiday with her friends

225
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:45,669
and not to ask him first.

226
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,640
So then go back, turn on the subtitles, of course in English,

227
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,653
and read them through for the entire minute making sure

228
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:58,133
that you understood everything exactly as you wrote down.

229
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:03,097
The ideas are all clear and true. That is the active listening practice

230
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:06,284
that you need to keep improving your skills.

231
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,090
So there you have it!

232
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:12,491
They were my five tips, five different techniques that you can use

233
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,555
to practise and to improve your English listening skills.

234
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:18,819
Of course, you can do it on your own.

235
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:20,780
You can do it with a study buddy

236
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,842
but I recommend that you just choose one of the techniques

237
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:28,941
we talked about today and put it into practice over a whole week.

238
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,071
Try and do it a few times see if it sticks.

239
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:34,490
See if it's something that's working for you,

240
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,206
something that you enjoy.

241
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:39,112
I've left some links to some really great Ted Talks

242
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:42,632
down in the description. You can use them to get started

243
00:13:42,632 --> 00:13:46,024
and if you want to focus on natural pronunciation

244
00:13:46,024 --> 00:13:49,293
then check out this video right here, the one about

245
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,862
common reductions that I mentioned earlier

246
00:13:52,174 --> 00:13:56,371
or this entire course that I made here on YouTube

247
00:13:56,371 --> 00:14:00,119
that's about linking and natural pronunciation.

248
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:01,395
I'll see you in there!
