1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,750
 

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:08,039
The 1997 film Titanic is one of the most successful and iconic movies ever

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:14,699
Produced it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,260
Who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated voyage

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,090
It is absolutely full of vocabulary. You can use to sound more sophisticated and polite for this lesson

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,079
We've chosen two scenes in the first one Jack joins the first-class passengers for dinner after having rescued Rose

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,840
Having a completely different philosophy about life

8
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:44,519
The lack of compatibility between him and the rest of the dinner guests becomes strikingly obvious and make for a very interesting

9
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,279
And somewhat humorous conversation then in perhaps the most iconic scene from the film

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,699
Jack and Rose share a moment on the front of the ship

11
00:00:55,329 --> 00:01:02,398
Unfortunately, we cannot include the full two scenes here on YouTube. You can enjoy the lesson without watching the original clips

12
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,180
however

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,659
I recommend that you watch them first by cleaning up at the top then come back here for the lesson if you're ready

14
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,659
Then let's climb aboard the Titanic

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:20,640
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage. Mr. Dawson, I hear they're quite good on this ship

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,050
Jack here has been momentarily invited to share dinner in first-class

17
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,360
Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow evening

18
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:37,529
He comes from the steerage which in a passenger ship is the part of a ship providing the cheapest

19
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,099
Accommodation for passengers in the past. This is where immigrants would sleep when traveling to a faraway place

20
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,739
When we say accommodations, we mean a place for someone to stay temporarily

21
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,589
For example when you're in another city

22
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,149
You might need to find accommodations to stay the night on the Titanic

23
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,050
The passengers accommodations are the room where he or she stayed

24
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,699
Example the price for the holiday includes flights and accommodations

25
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,019
the university provides free accommodations for first-year students

26
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,289
Then the woman says I hear they're quite good

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,709
when we say I hear we're basically saying I know about something because someone has told me about it and

28
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,820
We use it to introduce a subject that we want to talk about with someone

29
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,149
So Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag. I don't know what you heard that it was a disaster

30
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,239
This is different from the common expression. I hear you, which means I understand what you're saying

31
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:43,139
Like I said, we will love you back until late. I hear ya. Mrs. Dunphy you could trust me

32
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:52,469
Jack answers the question about the state of the steerage in the following way the best I've seen man hardly any rats

33
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,949
Ma'am is short for madam and is a word we use to address a woman in a polite and respectful way

34
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,350
Go back and turn the heaters on in our rooms. I'd like a cup of tea when I return

35
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,130
Hardly any rats means almost no rats or very few rats

36
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,750
Example there is hardly any traffic

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,490
This is a comical response which gives us an idea of what you could expect in the steerage area of a ship. For example

38
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,730
Rats wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary

39
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,770
Hey, so I know you're watching this because you're passionate about English fluency and making the learning journey fun and meaningful

I look forward to seeing you inside the fluency circle. Now, let's get back to the Titanic

53
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,860
It was of some assistance to my fiance

54
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,330
We're going to analyze this utterance from a connected speech point of view try saying this utterance

55
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,039
Did you say it like this he was of some assistance

56
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,500
if you didn't you probably put stress on the words was and of

57
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:06,279
Resulting in he was of some assistance

58
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,949
These are structure words meaning you don't put stress on them another feature

59
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:18,429
You might have missed is the linking between was and of was of some was of some assistance

60
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:25,989
Another reminder is that the F in of is actually pronounced moon if you pronounce it as in

61
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,750
You will say off

62
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,119
Amy I was off by a factor of

63
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:38,409
10,000 in the following two examples of is linked with the S consonant from the word before

64
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:44,679
Months of my life glass of milk. I put 10 months of my life into this place a

65
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,219
glass of milk or something to wash that down with

66
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,309
It turns out that mr. Dawson is quite a fine artist. He was kind enough to show me some of his work today

67
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,329
We used this phrase to be kind enough to do something to express our gratitude for an action

68
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,870
Someone did we only say this in formal situations?

69
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,539
Example he was kind enough to hold the door open for us in the following example

70
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:14,408
We hear this phrase used together with other similar polite sophisticated vocabulary

71
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:20,259
Like the words ma'am as we've seen and pardon me which equals to excuse me

72
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,620
Two champagnes, please, sir

73
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,669
Pardon me young man. Would you be kind enough to order me a whiskey sour yes, ma'am. I can miss

74
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,820
Frozen I differ somewhat in a definition to find out

75
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,490
Not to impugn your work, sir

76
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
Somewhat means to some degree

77
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,220
For example, you could say that the Titanic is a large ship and this is a small one

78
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:54,540
Then this one would be a somewhat big ship meaning not as small as this one, but not as big as the Titanic you

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,689
Seem somewhat familiar if I threatened you before

80
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,199
I'll make a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates

81
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Not to impugn your work, sir

82
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,320
Impugn means to criticize a person's character intentions, etc

83
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,519
By suggesting that someone is not honest and should not be trusted

84
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,630
This is not a very common word outside of formal settings nowadays

85
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,600
Yoshiko free don't dare impugn me honor boy. I

86
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
Agreed to go free but it was you to specify we're nowhere

87
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,459
So every single week we make fun lessons like this one to help you

88
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,139

89
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,199
Subtitles just like Victoria who said that our videos are helping her on her journey to become an English teacher

92
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,989
Where exactly do you live? Mr. Dorsen?

93
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,049
Well right now my address is the RMS Titanic

94
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
After that, I'm on God's good humour

95
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,880
Here he means that he doesn't have anything planned after being on the ship

96
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,550
This is not a fixed expression

97
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:19,139
But rather a creative way, he uses to say that he's at peace with letting circumstances or her God direct where his life goes

98
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,449
And how is it you have means to travel I work my way from place to place

99
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,960
You know tramp steamers and such

100
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,269
If you have the means to do something you have the financial resources to do something in other words

101
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:39,149
You have the money for it example. I don't have the means to travel right now, but I'm going to start saving up a

102
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,760
Tramp steamer is a type of ship

103
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,339
He uses an interesting term when he says he's worked on tramp steamers and such

104
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:53,939
Here and such means and similar things. It is also common nowadays to hear and whatnot

105
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,589
I've gotta go back to work defending our nation against terrorists and whatnot

106
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,269
somebody

107
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,089
But I want my ticket on Titanic here at a lucky hand at poker a very lucky hand

108
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,409
In the context of card games your hand is the group of cards that you've received or you get dealt

109
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,430
Two deal cards means to distribute the cards among the players

110
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:20,279
Later in the scene Jack uses this expression

111
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,899
He never know what hand are gonna get dealt next in this case. He's speaking metaphorically to say that in life

112
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,208
Sometimes you have luck and sometimes you don't

113
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,120
He did win his ticket to the Titanic on a bet by playing poker. Sorry mama funk goolah

114
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,929
'du you bet I'm sorry. You're not gonna see your mom again for a long time

115
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,779
Cuz we're going to America

116
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Now say

117
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,659
Did you say it like leo or the lucky hand at poker

118
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:04,349
But I want my ticket on Titanic here at a lucky hand at poker at like all prepositions

119
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:08,579
Most of the time is reduced to its weak form listen carefully

120
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:16,440
I'll meet you tomorrow at 10:00 at the office in Leo's phrase at is followed by a which is another word

121
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,339
Which you need to articulate with very little or no emphasis at all

122
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:24,420
So you say it like this out of lucky hand?

123
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,210
What are you doing at a high-school dance?

124
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,109
This came at a bad time for George senior

125
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
one day at a time penny

126
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,540
One day at a time Oh life is a game of luck a real man makes his own luck

127
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:55,379
To make one's own luck means to rely on one's skill ability and perseverance to capitalize on

128
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,250
Opportunity rather than relying solely on luck itself

129
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:05,610
Example she's a successful businesswoman who's made her own luck. And you find that sort of rootless existence

130
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,250
appealing to you

131
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,670
Literally roots are the part of a plant that grows underground

132
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:17,490
Figuratively speaking. A person's roots are his home work relationships, etc

133
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,399
We can use the phrase to put down roots, which means to do the things necessary for a stable life

134
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,159
Getting married buying a house having children

135
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,500
But Jack's life is different as he doesn't seem to have nor want a place to call home

136
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:38,279
So that's why the woman says he has a rootless existence. Of course, she's being very rude here

137
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,900
appealing means pleasing or

138
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,949
Attractive having qualities that people like if you find something appealing or something is appealing to you

139
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,170
It means that you like that thing

140
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:54,150
Example her singing is very appealing to me. I find her singing very appealing

141
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,330
Well, yes, ma'am, I do

142
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,879
I mean, I've got everything I need right here with me. I've got air in my lungs and a few blank sheets of paper

143
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:11,949
Jack is saying here. His needs to be happy are very simple. He just needs oxygen and paper to draw as he is an artist

144
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,739
Jack I want you to draw me like one of your french girls

145
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,639
Wearing this all right

146
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,870
Wearing only this

147
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,689
I

148
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:47,089
Mean I love waking up in the morning not knowing what's gonna happen or who I'm gonna meet

149
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,529
Where I'm gonna wind up

150
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,599
Wind up it means to arrive or end up in a specified state situation

151
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,879
Or place without planning it the past form of this phrase a verb is wound up

152
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:04,099
Psychologically speaking. It's perfectly normal to wind up with someone like your parents

153
00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:08,809
Next to my mom will probably wind up with someone who loves my brother more than me

154
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:15,050
Can you think of an example where you could apply this phrasal verb to something that happened in your own life?

155
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:21,109
For example, I didn't expect to move to Barcelona. I just wound up here after teaching English and Galicia Spain

156
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,699
Just the other night

157
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:27,919
I was sleeping under a bridge and now here I am on the grandest ship in the world having champagne with you fine people

158
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:36,229
Rand is an adjective that means impressive especially because of size importance, etc

159
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,060
This is perhaps why the famous Canyon in Arizona is named the Grand Canyon at?

160
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:47,209
The time of his existence the Titanic was said to be the grandest ship in history. I

161
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:50,568
Figured life's a gift and I don't intend on wasting it

162
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,129
To intend on doing something is to plan or want to do something

163
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,689
This is the verb form of the phrase to have the intention of doing something

164
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,729
You can say intend on doing something or to do something

165
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:07,519
And then I intend to return here tomorrow

166
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,219
I intend to free my father. I hope you wanted to see it. I can't let you do that by them

167
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,639
Hey, are you a Leonardo DiCaprio fan?

168
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,799
Well, then I highly recommend you check out this new playlist that features all the lessons that we've made with him

169
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,839
You can watch that after you finish this lesson by clicking up at the top or down in the description below

170
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,799
You'll learn to take life as it comes at you boy you go count

171
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,910
To make each day count

172
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,669
If you take something as it comes you deal with it in the moment rather than planning for it

173
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:48,040
This is again another way in which he expresses that he's happy to accept life as it is

174
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,959
To make something count means to ensure that the maximum benefit is obtained

175
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,920
Example you'll only have one opportunity to impress the interviewer

176
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:02,740
So you better make a count if you make each day count you live each day to the fullest

177
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
I changed my mind

178
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,250
This is a very common expression that we use to say we have changed our decision plan or opinion about something

179
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:25,039
Hey Mike. Yeah, I changed my mind. I don't want to do this

180
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,520
Then as Jack instructs rose on what to do he says

181
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
Keep your eyes closed

182
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,239
To peek is to look at something briefly or to look at someone or something secretly especially from a hidden place

183
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,439
Jack here. Simply doesn't want her to open her eyes just at that moment

184
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Did you fly in an airplane today?

185
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
Yes, I did

186
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,529
No peeking did we pot roast for dinner tonight?

187
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,890
Yes

188
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,780
Then although the phrases hold on to and hold on look similar

189
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,470
They mean different things

190
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:20,550
When you hold on to something you make your hold or grip tighter so that you do not drop it

191
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,249
Or do not fall as there on the edge of the ship

192
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,170
She needs to hold on to the railing. So she doesn't fall on the other hand

193
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,429
Hold on by itself is simply a phrasal verb. That means wait

194
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:36,450
Example, hold on. I will help you once I get off the phone

195
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:46,230
Also, don't forget that you can test your English by watching the clip a final time without subtitles and answering some quiz questions by
