00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,815
Hey there this is Emma from mmmEnglish!

2
00:00:03,815 --> 00:00:07,221
Today we're going to be doing some speaking practice together

3
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:09,040
and we're going to be practising with the

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,873
mmmEnglish Imitation Technique.

5
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:15,307
Now I've talked about this before. We've practised it together

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,554
before, it's one of the most effective ways that you can

7
00:00:18,554 --> 00:00:21,680
reduce your accent and fix some of those

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,602
pronunciation problems so that you're speaking English

9
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:26,621
clearly and confidently.

10
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:30,264
Plus, we're going to be using a lot of the narrative tenses

11
00:00:30,264 --> 00:00:32,498
you've been learning over the past few weeks.

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,004
The past continuous, the past perfect continuous

13
00:00:36,004 --> 00:00:37,929
and the past perfect simple.

14
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:41,440
Very, very exciting to be putting all of that grammar 

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,642
into practice in a speaking lesson.

16
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:46,591
Now one more thing before we get started. If you are

17
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:50,186
not a subscriber yet, make sure you hit that button down there,

18
00:00:50,186 --> 00:00:52,544
turn on notifications so that you never

19
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:55,123
miss one of the mmmEnglish lessons.

20
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:57,173
All right, time to dive in!

21
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:05,477
So if you're new to mmmEnglish you may not have 

22
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:08,110
practised with one of my Imitation lessons before.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,801
It's really simple.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,838
I'm going to help you practise out loud with me all the way

25
00:01:12,838 --> 00:01:13,835
through this lesson.

26
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:18,132
And if you like it, there are several other Imitation lessons

27
00:01:18,132 --> 00:01:21,733
on my channel and I've also got some Imitation courses

28
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:24,414
available on the mmmEnglish website. 

29
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:25,910
You can get to it up here

30
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,298
or the link is down in the description below.

31
00:01:28,298 --> 00:01:31,684
Today we're going to practise storytelling in English,

32
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,676
an exceptionally important skill to have.

33
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:38,320
I'm going to be sharing a simple story about a coincidence

34
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,756
at the supermarket.

35
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:44,596
A coincidence that turned into a disaster not an awful disaster,

36
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:47,654
just a funny disaster. A mess.

37
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:52,984
Keep in mind that you can easily exchange my story with your own

38
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:55,507
once you've practised along with me for a little while.

39
00:01:55,507 --> 00:01:59,013
That's what I really want you to do is, take the story that I'm using

40
00:01:59,242 --> 00:02:01,760
and adapt it, make it your own.

41
00:02:02,386 --> 00:02:05,401
An unusual trip to the supermarket.

42
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,888
Step one, listen and read.

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,864
On Monday I was doing my weekly shopping

44
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,396
when I bumped into an old friend of mine.

45
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,838
We hadn't seen each other for more than 10 years,

46
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:25,000
so it was a real surprise to see her in my local supermarket.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,225
We stopped in the middle of the aisle, mouths open,

48
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:33,098
then hugged and chatted for what felt like ages!

49
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:37,756
It turns out, she'd been living overseas in Istanbul

50
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,354
and had only just moved back home.

51
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:43,953
That's why we hadn't seen each other for so long!

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,454
While we were talking, another friend wandered up the aisle.

53
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,556
It was one of our old classmates from high school.

54
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:54,142
What a coincidence!

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,314
And it turns out, he'd recently become a dad!

56
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:01,359
He had his new baby girl tucked up in the pram.

57
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:05,354
He admitted to us he was just trying to get out of the house

58
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:06,214
for a while

59
00:03:06,589 --> 00:03:09,452
so we decided to go to the cafe next door.

60
00:03:09,618 --> 00:03:13,240
We couldn't miss this chance to catch up after all of these years

61
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:15,761
but it turned out to be a disaster!

62
00:03:16,386 --> 00:03:20,026
We ordered cake but it tasted terrible.

63
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:24,137
We ordered coffee but it never came!

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,305
When one of the waitresses was rushing to open the door

65
00:03:28,305 --> 00:03:33,504
for a customer she knocked over a huge vase of flowers which,

66
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,332
you guessed it, smashed onto our table

67
00:03:37,582 --> 00:03:39,754
and soaked us with water!

68
00:03:40,484 --> 00:03:43,598
Fortunately, we were having so much fun reminiscing about

69
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,910
old school days

70
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:48,444
that it didn't really bother us too much.

71
00:03:49,805 --> 00:03:52,900
Step two, listen and copy me.

72
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:57,174
Now you need to imitate exactly what I say

73
00:03:57,174 --> 00:04:00,098
so that means you're trying to copy my pronunciation,

74
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:04,595
the word stress, the pause in every sentence.

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,604
You can even try and imitate my facial expressions

76
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:11,803
to practise communicating with more than just words in English.

77
00:04:11,803 --> 00:04:16,175
Now there's going to be a pause after each sentence or clause

78
00:04:16,175 --> 00:04:19,099
so that you can practise out loud with me okay?

79
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:22,613
Just try and relax and go with the flow all right?

80
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:25,564
It's just you and it's me, we're here right now. 

81
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,849
We're doing some speaking practice together.

82
00:04:27,974 --> 00:04:29,120
We're gonna have some fun!

83
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,818
Step three, shadow me.

84
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:49,679
So now we're moving on to step three which

85
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,062
is a little more challenging than the last one.

86
00:08:53,062 --> 00:08:56,758
So don't forget that you can pause here, you can go back

87
00:08:56,758 --> 00:09:00,507
and practise section two as many times as you need to

88
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:04,217
before we keep going. It's gonna take a little bit of practice

89
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:07,588
and some time for you to get comfortable and relaxed.

90
00:09:07,817 --> 00:09:10,692
So you're going to shadow me and that means 

91
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,748
that you're listening to me

92
00:09:12,748 --> 00:09:16,186
and speaking at exactly the same time.

93
00:09:16,478 --> 00:09:19,914
And the reason why we're doing this is because I want you to copy 

94
00:09:19,914 --> 00:09:23,673
the rhythm and the tone that I'm using.

95
00:09:23,673 --> 00:09:27,622
The pattern and the sounds that are coming out of my mouth

96
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:32,246
so even if you get tongue-tied and you get stuck

97
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:36,322
trying to make the words come out as quickly as I am saying them,

98
00:09:36,593 --> 00:09:40,580
don't worry about it! Focus on following the rhythm.

99
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:44,897
Follow that rhythm. 

100
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,640
So you made it all the way through, well done!

101
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,092
I know that it's a little bit of a mouthful trying to get

102
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,741
all of those auxiliary verbs out, right?

103
00:11:36,741 --> 00:11:40,734
Trying to get it all sounding natural using those contractions

104
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,044
and the linking between words.

105
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,194
But now that you're feeling a little more comfortable with my story

106
00:11:47,194 --> 00:11:50,822
why don't you try adapting your own story?

107
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:54,321
You know, have you had any funny coincidences happen to you

108
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:58,513
lately? Run into someone that you haven't seen in a long time?

109
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,205
If you have, then share that story down in the comments.

110
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:06,043
See if you can practise using some of the same tenses

111
00:12:06,043 --> 00:12:08,556
that we shared in this lesson together.

112
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,679
I'll be down to check them out as soon as I can.

113
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,447
I'm looking forward to jumping down and reading some of your

114
00:12:14,447 --> 00:12:15,624
stories soon.

115
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:19,442
Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next lesson.

116
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:20,240
Bye for now!
