1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,760
And a latte for the lovely lady!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,440
Thank you!

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,240
Hey!

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,440
Oh, do I know you. ?

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,160
You do now.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,480
OK. 

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,000
Is this free?

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,600
- 'Is this free?' 
- 'Yes, of course!'

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,760
Standard question, standard response.

10
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,440
So standard, we forget to think.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,800
Well I like to challenge standards.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,480
Catch people off-guard.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,680
Make them think.

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,960
Is this free?

15
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,640
No, it's two pounds.

16
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,520
Oh, I'm sorry, are you waiting for someone?

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,679
Well, not exactly.
The last guy only had a pound on him.

18
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,880
He went looking for the other 50p.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,680
But if you've got two pounds on you now -- 
it's yours!

20
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,560
But you only asked him only one-fifty!

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,280
Inflation! 
Oh, there he is!

22
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm taking it!

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,200
Excuse me, so sorry, is this free?

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,240
Fuck-off.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,440
Look old chap, 
I just asked for the seat!

26
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,960
I know. And I only asked you to fuck-off.

27
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,640
Well, I say,

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,480
Fuck-off yourself then!

29
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,720
Excuse me!

30
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,600
Is this free?

31
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,160
Just a minute!

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
Are you gay?

33
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
No.

34
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,080
Are you Muslim?

No!

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,439

No!!!

38
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,080
- But any of these are a problem to you?
- No, no, no, no -

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,309
- Is this free?
- Yes, of course.

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,760
But.  I wouldn't advise you to sit there.

41
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,800
They're watching this spot very carefully.

42
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,400
- Is this free?
- Of course!

43
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,229
But could you help me with a quick survey I'm conducting?

44
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,760
- Sure!
- Thank you!

45
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,440
