1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,120
You're so hypnotizing

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,660
Could you be the devil

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,080
could you be an angel

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Your touch magnetizing

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,660
Feels like I'm floating, leaves my body glowing

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,360
They say be afraid

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,480
You're not like the others, futuristic lovers

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,660
Different DNA, they don't understand you

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,620
You're from a whole other world

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,780
A different dimension

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,720
You open my eyes

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,420
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,140
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me

14
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,360
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison

15
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,380
Take me, t-t-take me

16
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,660
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:02,660
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:08,880
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial

19
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,140
You're so supersonic

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,360
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,260
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,140
You're from a whole other world

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,320
A different dimension

24
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,260
You open my eyes

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,120
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,860
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me

27
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,320
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison

28
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,020
Take me, t-t-take me

29
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,840
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction

30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,280
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,480
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,500
There is this transcendental, on another level

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,540
Boy, you're my lucky star

34
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,180
I wanna walk on your wave length

35
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,740
And be there when you vibrate

36
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,360
For you I risk it all, all

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,760
Kiss me, k-k-kiss me

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,100
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison

39
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,820
Take me, t-t-take me

40
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,480
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction

41
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,100
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign

42
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:55,460
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial

43
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:06,800
Extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial

44
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,860
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign

45
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,380
Its supernatural, extraterrestrial

46
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,920
 

47
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:11,015
 

48
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:16,545
 

49
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:18,815
 

50
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,305
 

51
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:24,875
 

52
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,835
 

53
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,885
 

54
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:34,145
 

55
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:35,485
