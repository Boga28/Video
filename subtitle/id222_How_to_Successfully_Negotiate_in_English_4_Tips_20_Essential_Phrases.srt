1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
How many times have you negotiated this
past year? You might be thinking, Well,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,480
never. I don't really negotiate
in English as part of my job,

3
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:09,640
but let me ask you this.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,520
When was the last time you
negotiated for an extended deadline

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,440
or asked for a change
in your job schedule?

6
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,440
When was the last time you asked
for a promotion or a raise at work?

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,080
When was the last time you negotiated
with your spouse or partner to finish up

8
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:32,800
the dinner dishes or when was the last
time you negotiate with your kids to wake

9
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,880
up and get dressed on time for school?

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,040
It's surprising just how often we
negotiate in our everyday lives.

11
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:45,400
Knowing how to successfully negotiate
not only helps you resolve conflict or

12
00:00:45,401 --> 00:00:46,081
get what you want,

13
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:50,479
but it also helps you build
better relationships and create

14
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:54,280
lasting solutions. And this
Confident English lesson today,

15
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:57,080
you're going to learn
four essential strategies,

16
00:00:57,081 --> 00:01:01,480
plus 20 phrases to help you
successfully negotiate in English.

17
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,800
But first, if you don't already know,

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,120
I'm Annemarie with

27
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:52,360
let's get right to it
with strategy. Number one,

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,560
identify your ultimate goals,
limits and alternatives.

29
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,640
Before you enter into a negotiation,

30
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:04,520
you have to know what you want
in the end. In other words,

31
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:08,280
you need to know your ultimate
goal. To help you figure that out,

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,040
ask yourself this question,

33
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,400
What do I want the outcome
of this negotiation to be?

34
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,680
When you know the answer to that question,

35
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:21,160
it's important to communicate
it clearly and directly in the

36
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:24,520
negotiation without any bells
or whistles. In other words,

37
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:29,080
without any enhancements or extra
additions, you want to keep it simple.

38
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:32,560
For example, you might have a
meeting with your boss and say,

39
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,680
I want to discuss getting a raise that
matches my current level of expertise and

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,160
responsibilities. With that statement,

41
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:44,600
it's extremely clear what you
are looking for. With that said,

42
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,760
we don't always get exactly what we want.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,639
There tends to be a compromise
somewhere in that negotiation,

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,560
so you need to be prepared for that,

45
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,600
and that's where knowing your ultimate
limits and alternatives is important as

46
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:01,160
well. In other words,

47
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:06,000
if you have an ideal amount for
the raise that you're looking for,

48
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,480
what is the bottom limit? What is the
ultimate minimum that you'd accept?

49
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,960
That's your bottom limit,

50
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,200
or are there any alternatives you're
willing to discuss? Instead of a raise,

51
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:20,200
are you willing to look
at increased benefits?

52
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,000
Knowing the answers to those questions
are essential Before you go into

53
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:29,080
that negotiation, in
thinking through your goals,

54
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,120
limits and alternatives,

55
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,320
essentially what you're doing
is identifying your bottom line.

56
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,120
And once you know what
that bottom line is,

57
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,480
here are several phrases you can use
in English to communicate it. Clearly,

58
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,840
I draw the line at X
because of Y. For example,

59
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,600
I draw the line at getting a raise
because I want to see an increase in my

60
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:53,440
salary. With that statement,

61
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,400
what you're saying is you're
not interested in alternatives,

62
00:03:56,401 --> 00:04:01,240
you're not willing to discuss anything
else other than an increase in your

63
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:06,080
income. Similar to saying that you're
drawing a line or setting a boundary,

64
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,720
you can say X is
non-negotiable because of Y.

65
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,120
A raise is non-negotiable because I
want to see an increase in my salary

66
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:21,400
or anything less than X
will not meet my needs.

67
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,279
And lastly, I'm willing
to meet you halfway at X,

68
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,160
but anything less than
that is non-negotiable.

69
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,000
When you're willing to
meet someone halfway,

70
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,040
you're willing to compromise
With this first strategy,

71
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,960
I'm using several example sentences
around the topic of asking for a raise

72
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:45,880
at work. I did that intentionally
because asking for a raise is often quite

73
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:49,240
uncomfortable and I want you to
know how to do it successfully.

74
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,320
So let's finish strategy number
one with a scenario that really

75
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:55,800
brings all of this together.

76
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,480
Let's say you've been in conversations
with your boss about a raise

77
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,120
and your boss has proposed an
alternative rather than an increase in

78
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:09,320
salary, the company wants
to offer other benefits.

79
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,480
You're not really interested in that,

80
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,800
so here's how you could respond using
what you've learned in this strategy.

81
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,760
An increase in my salary is non-negotiable
because it will ensure that I'm

82
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:26,760
able to keep up with the current cost
of living in this city and it matches

83
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,839
my current workload here in the company.

84
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,600
There's one last thing I want to mention
here before we go on to strategy number

85
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:38,360
two, and I want to underscore the
importance of identifying your goals,

86
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,240
limits and alternatives.

87
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,760
Negotiating is also cultural,
and in English speaking culture,

88
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,520
it's common for us to
seek a win-win solution.

89
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:53,880
In other words, a situation
in which everyone wins,

90
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,279
everyone gets something that they
want. Going into a negotiation,

91
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,560
knowing your upper limits,
your bottom limits,

92
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,000
and any alternatives you're open
to discussing will help you have a

93
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:11,839
successful win in the end. And that
leads me into strategy number two,

94
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,960
find common ground and build rapport.

95
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,960
This is part of creating
an environment of seeking a

96
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:21,160
win-win solution.

97
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:25,960
What this means is rather than go
into a negotiation or discussion

98
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,560
immediately demanding what you want,

99
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,440
it's important to enter into the
negotiation slowly and keep in mind the

100
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,360
relationship you have
with the other person.

101
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,520
If you know that individual or
even if it's someone new to you,

102
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:44,600
a potential client, it's
important to establish rapport,

103
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,839
to build a relationship, and
we do that through small talk.

104
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,960
Small talk allows us to
identify common ground and also

105
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:59,080
feel out where the other person
is, what is their point of view,

106
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:00,000
how are they doing?

107
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,360
All of that will inform how you
begin the process of negotiating.

108
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,560
So once you're ready for that negotiation,
that meeting that you've scheduled,

109
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,480
start with some basic small talk questions
such as, how's your day going? Or,

110
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,560
I heard you just got back
from vacation. How was it?

111
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,880
Then once you've had a little bit of
time to get comfortable with each other,

112
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,440
you can transition into the
point of the conversation.

113
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:32,960
You might do that with something such
as, Well, I don't wanna waste your time,

114
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:34,200
so let me get right to the point.

115
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:39,040
I'd like to discuss a raise that
matches my current level of expertise

116
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,800
and the responsibilities I
have here at the company.

117
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,560
Before we move on to
strategy number three,

118
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:49,320
let's look at one more example of a
small top question you could use if

119
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:52,760
you're meeting a potential
buyer or a potential client.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Imagine you're meeting with a potential
buyer of your product for the very first

121
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,840
time. You've shaken hands,

122
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,280
you've just sat down and you're
feeling a little bit awkward.

123
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,920
How do you get things going?

124
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,120
Here's a small talk question you could
use in organizing this meeting with you

125
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:13,000
today. I had the opportunity to interact
with quite a few of your team members.

126
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,200
You seem super organized. What's
the secret in your organization?

127
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,600
With that small top question,

128
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,160
you are creating a
friendly open environment,

129
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:27,880
starting out with something positive and
allowing a little bit of small talk to

130
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:32,640
occur before you get into the negotiation.
And now, strategy Number three,

131
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:37,839
understand the other side just
as you want to know exactly

132
00:08:37,841 --> 00:08:40,760
what your goals, limits
and alternatives might be.

133
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,600
You want to have a sense
of what the goals, limits,

134
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:47,200
and alternatives of the
other side might be.

135
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:52,080
Knowing what the other side is thinking
or what their point of view is will

136
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:56,640
allow you to make a better
decision and weigh your options

137
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,679
before you go into the negotiation.

138
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,040
To weigh one's options means
to assess the pros and cons of

139
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,679
a situation or potential
decision. In addition to that,

140
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,040
understanding the other side's
position will help you have stronger

141
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,160
arguments. When you're ready
to discuss what you want,

142
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:20,240
not only can you anticipate what the
other side wants prior to the negotiation,

143
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,960
you can also ask questions during the
conversation to get better insight,

144
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:27,200
and here are several
questions you can use.

145
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,200
What do you think is a fair
and reasonable solution,

146
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,920
outcome or number and why?

147
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,280
Could you please tell me more about
how you arrived at X? For example,

148
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,800
could you please tell me more about
how you arrived at that decision,

149
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,760
or could you tell me more about
why you arrived at deciding?

150
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,360
Offering benefits is a better
choice than offering the raise.

151
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,480
Similarly, why do you believe X?

152
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:56,320
Why is X important to you?

153
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,640
Why is it important to you to offer
benefits as opposed to an increase in

154
00:10:01,641 --> 00:10:02,474
salary?

155
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:07,600
What part of my proposal
causes hesitancy or what part

156
00:10:07,601 --> 00:10:09,880
of my proposal is causing you concern?

157
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,559
Each one of those questions will
help you understand the other

158
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,000
motives and anything influencing
their decision. As a result,

159
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,920
you are more equipped to
respond appropriately,

160
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,160
argue for what you want or
compromise successfully.

161
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,000
The last strategy for a successful
negotiation in English is to

162
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:37,840
establish trust and everything that
we've talked about prior to this strategy

163
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,640
helps you do that. Establishing
common ground, building rapport,

164
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,720
asking open ended questions to
better understand someone's motive or

165
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:50,559
situation. In addition
to those strategies,

166
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,480
here are four more techniques
you can use to gain trust.

167
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:58,160
Number one, speak directly and concisely.

168
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,520
We talked about this a bit
in strategy number one,

169
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:04,360
when I said it's important
to communicate what you want.

170
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:07,880
Clearly this is essential
for the other side,

171
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:12,200
so there's no gray area or
room for misunderstanding.

172
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:17,040
What this means is using concrete,
straightforward language,

173
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,840
for example, rather than give a
range of numbers, for example,

174
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,400
we'd like to have this finished
within the next three to five months.

175
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:28,240
Be clear with what you want,

176
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:32,840
provide dates and the specific results
you're looking for. For example,

177
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,880
we want this finished by
January 5th next year.

178
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,600
Do you notice the difference?

179
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,720
Rather than giving some gray
estimate of three to five months,

180
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,920
we're giving an ultimate
deadline of a date.

181
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:51,559
Reducing the potential for
misunderstanding or miscommunication is

182
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,920
part of building trust.

183
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,640
The second technique you can use
is to show interest and openness.

184
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,800
Instead of bending the
truth in the negotiation,

185
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,480
it's important to be sincere and honest.

186
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:10,559
When communicating your goals and the
reasons for them to bend the truth is a

187
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,720
fantastic expression to know. In English,

188
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,240
it means to say some of the
truth, but not all of it.

189
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:22,200
There are some things that you're
hiding so that you are likely to get the

190
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,320
response that you want.

191
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,160
In addition to communicating your
goals with sincerity and honesty,

192
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,120
it's important to also ask those questions
we talked about in strategy number

193
00:12:33,121 --> 00:12:35,920
three with sincerity and honesty,

194
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:41,080
express genuine curiosity
to understand someone

195
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,240
else's position,

196
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:46,160
what they're having to think through
and the decisions they have to make in

197
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:47,520
order to meet you halfway.

198
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,800
The third technique you can use to
build trust is to actively listen.

199
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:53,601
Now,

200
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:58,040
I have a whole lesson on the topic of how
to show that you're actively listening

201
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,679
in English, and I'll leave a link to that
lesson below if you want to know more,

202
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,720
but here are a couple of
keys to actively listening.

203
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,600
In English speaking culture,
we maintain eye contact. Now,

204
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:15,160
we don't stare nonstop. Of course,
we occasionally blink and look away,

205
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:20,840
but maintaining eye contact indicates
that we're focused on you and

206
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,674
what you're saying.

207
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,760
What you're expressing is important
enough for me to listen carefully,

208
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,559
and I tell you that through eye
contact. In addition to that,

209
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,400
we also tend to ask clarifying
questions or repeat what

210
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:40,080
we heard you say to make sure we
understood correctly. For example,

211
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:44,880
you're saying it's not possible for your
team to get this finished by January

212
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,640
5th. Is that correct? Or if I understood
you correctly, you're thinking X,

213
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,920
Is that right? What I heard you say was X,

214
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,240
Have I understood correctly? And lastly,

215
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,200
could you clarify what you meant
by and then repeat what it is

216
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,760
that you're not really sure about?

217
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,720
Before we talk about the fourth
technique you can use to build trust.

218
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,160
Let's look at a scenario where you
might hear some of this language.

219
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,480
Imagine you're traveling with a
friend and at the very last minute,

220
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:20,280
your friend wants to change the itinerary
for the last couple days of your trip,

221
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,960
and you're not really so sure about this.

222
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:26,160
You like having a plan
and sticking to the plan,

223
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,760
so your friend proposes an idea and
you summarize what you've understood by

224
00:14:31,761 --> 00:14:36,440
saying, I think I understand.
So what you're saying is,

225
00:14:36,441 --> 00:14:38,040
rather than go to the museum today,

226
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:42,680
you want to save it to the last day of
our trip because you think it won't be as

227
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:45,920
crowded. Is that right? In saying that,

228
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,040
you're letting your friend know that
you've listened carefully and you're

229
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,520
working hard to understand
their side. Now,

230
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,320
you may or may not agree with that.
You may want to stick to the plan,

231
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:00,880
but you are acknowledging that you've
heard and understood what your friend has

232
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:01,714
suggested.

233
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,520
And now the fourth technique you can
use in strategy number four for building

234
00:15:06,521 --> 00:15:09,600
trust is to use inclusive language.

235
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,560
Let's compare these two sentences.

236
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:17,440
I want a solution that satisfies
these conditions versus

237
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,720
we need a solution that
satisfies these conditions.

238
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,560
What do you notice about those
two sentences? Of course,

239
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,480
the first one begins with I.

240
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,080
I'm creating a conversation
in which it is me against you.

241
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,840
We want different things. We're
not in this together. However,

242
00:15:37,841 --> 00:15:42,040
when I switch to inclusive
language with the word we,

243
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm recognizing that we
both want a solution.

244
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,480
We both want an ideal outcome to
this particular need that we have.

245
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,440
We're in this together.

246
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:56,520
We're going to work together to find
a solution that makes everybody happy.

247
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,560
Now that you have these four strategies
on how to successfully negotiate in

248
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:06,440
English as well as several phrases you
can use, I have two questions for you.

249
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,720
Number one,

250
00:16:07,721 --> 00:16:12,520
give me an example of a situation in
which you might need to negotiate in

251
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:15,920
English. It could be a situation
at work or outside of work.

252
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:21,240
What strategy or phrase did you learn
today that you will use to help you

253
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,000
next time? And number two,

254
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:28,200
if you have a go-to strategy to
help you successfully negotiate that

255
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:30,920
I didn't share today, I would
love to know what it is.

256
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,960
With both of those questions,

257
00:16:32,961 --> 00:16:36,520
you can share your answers
with me in the comments below.

258
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:39,960
That's also a great place to
share any questions you have.

259
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,720
If you found today's lesson
helpful, be sure to let me know.

260
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:45,920
You can do that in one very simple way.

261
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,800
Give this lesson a thumbs up here
on YouTube, and while you're at it,
