about offices and describe where you work.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,600
Let’s start by looking at 
different types of offices. 

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,600
I work in an open plan office.  

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,800
It’s light and modern, but it can be quite noisy 
sometimes, and it can be hard to focus on my work. 

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,360
My office has cubicles. It’s OK but sometimes  

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,840
I find it depressing that there are 
no windows and I can’t see the sky.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,800
Is your office open plan? Many modern offices are.  

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,840
‘Open plan’ means that everything is in one large 
space, and there aren’t many separate rooms. 

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,880
Many open plan offices have cubicles.
Large offices with many cubicles can be called  

15
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:45,360
‘cubicle farms’. This has a negative meaning. 
If you describe your office as a cubicle farm,  

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,120
you’re probably suggesting that 
it’s a boring place to work. 

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,360
I work for a start-up, and our office is nice but  

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,520
too small. It’s very cramped and there 
aren’t enough desks, so we have to hot desk. 

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,480
‘Cramped’ is a useful adjective. It 
means that you don’t have enough space.  

20
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,760
You can use it for many things. For 
example, if your kitchen is very small  

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,800
and you can’t move around without hitting 
things, then you could say it’s cramped.

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,520
What about ‘hot desk’? Do you know 
what that means, or can you guess? 

23
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,080
Hot desking is a way to share a workspace. If 
you hot desk, you don’t have your own desk.  

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,840
You share a desk with other workers, and you 
just take any free desk when you get to work.

25
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,960
Hot desking might be used in companies where 
people don’t all work at the same time. If  

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,240
employees work at different 
hours, they can hot desk:  

27
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,360
as one person leaves, another person 
can arrive and use the same workspace. 

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,200
After working here for a few years, I got a 
promotion and was given my own personal office. 

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,920
In many buildings, having a corner office of your 
own is considered the best location, because you  

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,200
have views on two sides. On the other hand, 
the words ‘personal office’ just mean that you  

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,960
don’t share your office with anyone. A personal 
office could also be a tiny room with no windows. 

32
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,560
Our company’s quite casual, so 
people just wear what they want. 

33
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,400
My company has a strict dress code. 
You have to dress smartly at all times. 

34
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:06,800
Does your office have a dress code? Do people in 
your office dress more casually, or more smartly? 

35
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,760
You can say ‘dress smartly’ or ‘dress 
formally’. The meaning is similar.

36
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,480
What else? Some workplaces might have a 
smart casual dress code. ‘Smart casual’ is  

37
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:34,880
in the middle between formal and informal. For 
example, for men, it might mean wearing a shirt  

38
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:45,440
and smart trousers, but not a tie or a full suit.
We have a small meeting room in our office.  

39
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,200
Sometimes we have bigger meetings, and we 
need to rent a larger space somewhere else. 

40
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,640
Many offices have a
meeting room.  

41
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,000
What other rooms might you find in 
an office? Can you think of three? 

42
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,240
Bigger offices might have a conference 
room – like a meeting room, but larger.

43
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,640
You might have a copy room, for making 
photocopies or printing documents.  

44
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,840
You might have a staff room or a break 
room, for employees to eat and relax.

45
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,640
An office could have an IT room or a 
server room, with computer equipment. 

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,120
We have a copy room with a photocopier  

47
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,920
and a heavy-duty printer. The copier tends 
to break a lot, or the paper gets jammed. 

48
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,440
‘Heavy-duty’ describes something that can do 
a large amount of work reliably. You can use  

49
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:01,200
it for other things, too. For example, if you 
work in construction, you might need heavy-duty  

50
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:10,640
boots – tough boots that can protect your feet.
Do you often have problems with printers or  

51
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:19,520
photocopiers at work? These machines are notorious 
for being unreliable. A common problem is a paper  

52
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,760
jam – the paper gets stuck inside the machine, 
and you have to open it up to try to get it out. 

53
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,200
Our office still relies on paper 
records for many things, so everyone  

54
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,280
has to know how our filing system works.
If your office still keeps paper records,  

55
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,120
you might use filing cabinets
to keep files and records organised. 

56
00:06:52,080 --> 00:07:02,000
Our company decided to go one hundred per cent 
paperless recently, so all records are digital. 

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
On the other hand, many companies 
are trying to use less paper,  

58
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,200
for environmental or budget reasons. If 
your company doesn’t use paper for anything,  

59
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,480
you can say that you work in a paperless office. 

60
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,520
Our office has a lot of security. 
Most internal doors are kept locked  

61
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:34,000
and you need a swipe card to open them.
Cameras monitor all areas of the office.  

62
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,200
Staff don’t like it, because they feel 
they’re being watched all the time. 

63
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,120
If your office has a lot of security 
measures, like card-locked doors,  

64
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:54,000
CCTV cameras or security guards, then you 
can say your company has *tight* security.

65
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,360
Another useful word is ‘surveillance’. 
Many security measures, like cameras,  

66
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,880
might be used to track employees, and 
see where they go and what they do.  

67
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,400
This is an example of surveillance – devices 
or rules designed to monitor employees.

68
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,280
What about your office? Can you describe 
your workplace? Put your description in the  

69
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,120
comments, and try to use some of the 
language you’ve seen in this lesson.

70
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,840
That’s all. Thanks for watching!
