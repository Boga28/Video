1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,580
Good morning, good afternoon and good evening!

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,420
Welcome to Smashing English!

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:09,519

because we make new videos all the time and

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,809
I don't want you to miss any so with that
said let's get on with the video!

5
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:23,050
If you're new here my name is Laura and I
am an English teacher.

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:28,060
I've taught around three and a half thousand
English lessons online, the main issue I come

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:35,629
across is people telling me: ‘I feel like
I'm not improving I feel stuck I feel like

8
00:00:35,629 --> 00:00:40,750
I've hit a level and that is where I will
always be, I can't get any better,’ so let

9
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,720
me give you some help if you're feeling a
little bit like this.

10
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,510
This is why you are not improving your English.

11
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:52,230
Okay reason number one: I love books I think
books are brilliant reading books are a fabulous

12
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,630
way of improving your vocabulary you can learn
grammar from books fabulous, however if you

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:04,330
are just reading and writing you will not
find the right level of speaking Improvement

14
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,580
that you want to see.

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,909
If you want to walk into a coffee shop and
order something in English like a native you

16
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:17,049
won't be able to do that if you are just reading
books you need to be speaking speaking speaking

17
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:22,530
speaking, and one of the cheapest easiest
exercises you can do is every day make a little

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,700
Vlog for yourself: Vlog- a video blog = Vlog.

19
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,860
Record yourself telling a story of what's
happened to you today or maybe you are going

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,479
to record yourself in your kitchen and it
only needs to be maybe 30 seconds and you

21
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,870
say hello today I'm in my kitchen as you can
see I'm cooking, just something where you

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:48,810
are speaking to camera and the reason why
I say record it is you can go back watch it,

23
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,590
listen out for any mistakes because most of
the time when we listen back we can hear mistakes

24
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,049
that we don't realize we are making when we
say them.

25
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,990
Okay reason number two why your English isn't
improving: you've lost motivation you are

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:09,690
simply learning English for the sake of learning
English and that is a very tricky place to

27
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:17,170
be if you want to keep motivation so I suggest
setting a goal you can even sign up for it

28
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:24,320
set a goal of taking an English test like
the Cambridge English test or an IELTS test:

29
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,320
i-e-l-t-s.

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,750
If you set a date and you book that test you
are going to find this sense of motivation

31
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,410
because you know in six months time I've got
that test I've paid for that test I need to

32
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,010
take it so I better practice because I want
to get a good result putting pressure on yourself

33
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:47,390
is the best way to get motivation especially
if it's pressure that you've created yourself,

34
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,190
you know, if you don't need to take an English
test then it's quite a nice pressure because

35
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,470
you've decided to because you want to for
yourself it's not like if I don't pass this

36
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:03,150
bad things will happen but it's a good level
of pressure, so book an English test for six

37
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,989
months in the future, trust me!

38
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:09,920
Okay reason number three: you're not speaking
to a native, now this is harder than it sounds

39
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,930
obviously if you're living in a country with
not a lot of native English speakers that's

40
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,569
quite hard to do but the internet is your
friend there are websites like iTalki, Cambly,

41
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:23,209
and many others I'll link some down below!

42
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:29,069
It feels really scary the first time because
you're talking online with someone who is

43
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,770
a native speaker and it's very nerve-wracking
but it is the best thing you could possibly

44
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,299
do, again, there's that pressure that you
have suddenly you're face to face with a native

45
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:45,069
speaker and you have to find conversation
that pressure does wonders for your improvement

46
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,129
I promise.

47
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:51,319
Okay reason number four: you're not consuming
media in your target language.

48
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,090
If you're saying to me: ‘I feel like I'm
not improving with my English I feel stuck’,

49
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:01,220
but then you also tell me that you don't listen
to any English speaking podcasts and English-speaking

50
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,000
TV shows anything then I don't know what to
tell you!

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,939
This is a must for your listening practice
and for your vocabulary you need to have at

52
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:15,909
least one TV show that you regularly watch
that is in English or one podcast that you

53
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,639
regularly listen to that is in English it's
just a must, even TikTok!

54
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,100
You can set the languages on your TikTok to
I understand English, I'm sure you can do

55
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,780
that and then you will get English speaking
content and this is fun this is an easy one

56
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,210
you just get to watch funny things so find
something that you really enjoy but watch

57
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,590
it in English, okay?

58
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:43,130
Okay reason number five: you are in your vocabulary
comfort zone your vocabulary comfort zone

59
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:48,960
is a lovely little place where you can use
the words that you are comfortable with, I

60
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,289
have it with French when I speak French I
always use the word: bizarre for everything,

61
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,770
I'm like oh c’est bizarre, c’est bizarre!

62
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,110
That's it because it's my comfort word I know
that that will work you know but I need to

63
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,180
push myself I need to expand that vocabulary,
so here's an exercise you can do to stretch

64
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,460
your comfort zone: find a video on Youtube,
silent movies are really good and Mr Bean

65
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:19,610
videos are really good, I want you to watch
30 seconds then I want you to say out loud

66
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,310
what you just saw in detail, what did you
just see happen?

67
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:30,389
Then I want you to say it again, I want you
to go back, tell me those same 30 seconds,

68
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,509
what did you see?

69
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:38,139
But use completely different words, different
sentences then do it again, I want three times

70
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:44,669
of you saying the same 30 seconds of video
describing what happened but in different

71
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:50,660
ways, ideally if you can record yourself doing
it that's even better, then keep going the

72
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,130
next 30 seconds okay watch it in enjoy, what
happened there?

73
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,050
Say it once, say it twice, say it three times-
if you start to struggle and you're really

74
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,810
thinking: ‘Oh I can't think of any other
words I can say here’ that's when you get

75
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:12,840
a thesaurus out, so thesauruses are not always
reliable sometimes they might give you a word

76
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,180
that isn't great in that context but it's
good to try and the internet like I said is

77
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,720
your friend, okay this is a really good exercise
just to stretch that comfort zone.

78
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,180
Reason number six: and I'm going to take you
straight to Pride Rock for this one, I think

79
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,190
a big reason why a lot of English students
find themselves not improving is because they

80
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,940
have too much pride, and I get it if you're
speaking English at a really good level and

81
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:44,660
your English teacher says to you okay I think
we should revise the past tense you might

82
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,430
feel a little- oh but I know the past tense
I'm I'm a good English speaker, and that's

83
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:56,050
true but grammar will always be something
that you need to keep practicing and sometimes

84
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,780
you might have to go right back to the basics
because we develop habits so it's really hard

85
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,139
to to get rid of that habit so sometimes you
might have to go all the way back and go back

86
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:12,650
to the grammar and look at it with new eyes
because if you're a bit older if it's been

87
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:17,960
10 years since you've done grammar you might
see it in a different way so don't have pride,

88
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,840
pride kills language development because you're
too busy thinking about oh but I don't want

89
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,379
to sound stupid I don't want to sound like
my level is lower you need to make those mistakes

90
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:35,120
you need to just be as open as a child learning
a language and that is the best best way to

91
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
develop.

92
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,300
Okay reason number seven why I think you're
not improving: you're not having fun!

93
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,520
You're treating learning English as this homework
this school assessment thing where you've

94
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,340
got a teacher who's going to, you know, I
don't know- hit you with a stick!

95
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,879
It's it's not fun if you are just reading
grammar exercises and doing nothing else,

96
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:00,900
oh my goodness who wants to do that?

97
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,860
Whereas if you're using video resources you're
using English speaking media you're speaking

98
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,820
to a teacher that you really connect with
and you have so much fun and you laugh it

99
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,889
doesn't feel like work and it motivates you
to to do it, and of course books and reading

100
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:26,639
help but you will learn just as much going
for a walk outside and maybe filming all of

101
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,811
it, come home, watch the video and you're
going to narrate everything, you know, you

102
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:35,289
might say okay so here I'm walking to the
left and I see a roundabout, but you'll learn

103
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,590
just as much.

104
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,659
Have fun!

105
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,720
Have fun!

106
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,800
But listen I am a language learner myself
I understand how it feels I get it there are

107
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,589
just walls that we hit sometimes and we feel
as though I'm never going to get any better

108
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:54,920
but I read somewhere from the author Paul
Noble, he says learning a language is a bit

109
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,360
like keeping a fire going, you have to keep
adding wood to it, if you leave it alone it

110
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:05,120
will get smaller and eventually go out so
you have to keep adding to it, and also language

111
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,880
development is a little bit like growing older,
think of the difference between a newborn

112
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,470
baby and an 18 year old it's massive you see
those developments like whoa!

113
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,839
And that's like the beginning of language
learning, you see these huge improvements

114
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,459
because you're starting from nothing and then
you learn the past tense the future tense

115
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:34,800
it's like it grows so big, whereas when you're
aged 20 the aging between 20 to 40 is isn't

116
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,360
that crazy, you know, it's not as obvious
as from a baby to a 20 year old, for example,

117
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,720
so the more advanced you get with your English
the progress is going to seem so much smaller

118
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,370
and it will feel like you're stuck like I'm
not making progress I'm not getting any better

119
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:57,180
but you are it's just way less obvious because
you're not learning these huge big Leaps and

120
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:04,310
Bounds so that's why you've got to unlock
the language make it less stiff make it fun

121
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,640
experiment go out of your comfort zone that
is how you beat the block.

122
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,480
Thank you so much for watching I hope this
was helpful if you have any questions you

123
