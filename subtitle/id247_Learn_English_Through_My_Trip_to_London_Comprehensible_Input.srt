00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
i am feeling very jet-lagged

193
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,320
very tired from all my travels

194
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,200
but there's one feeling I 
want to leave you guys with

195
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,480
and this feeling is serene

196
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,360
it means peaceful and calm

197
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,840
as today was a travel episode 
where is your dream destination

198
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,440
where would you love to travel 
to in the future and why

199
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,080
let me know in the comments i'm curious to know

200
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,880
and I will respond to every single one of you

201
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040

203
