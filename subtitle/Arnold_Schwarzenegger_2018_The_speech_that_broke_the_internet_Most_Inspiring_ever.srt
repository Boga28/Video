1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,230
Work your ass off there is no magic pill. It drives me crazy to go to the gym. If you read one hour a day

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:12,508
I went and worked out five hours a day, and I was working on construction

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,740
We have 24 hours a day, organize your day, work hard

4
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,560
I'm here to talk about success

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,720
I went to college

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:43,280
I went and worked out five hours a day and I was working on construction

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,360
Because in those days in bodybuilding, there was no money

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,860
I didn't have the money for food supplements or anything. So I had to go to work. So I worked in construction

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,329
I went to college I worked out in the gym and at night from 8 o'clock at night to 12 midnight

10
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,329
I went to acting class

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,479
four times a week

12
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,760
I did all that

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,460
There was not one single minute that I wasted

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,780
And this is why I'm standing here today

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,120
At the age of 20 I went to London and I won the Mr Universe contest as the youngest Mr Universe ever

16
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,560
and it was because I had a goal

17
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,500
If you don't have a vision of where you go

18
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,120
And if you don't have a goal where you go, you drift around and you never end up anywhere

19
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,840
74% of the people hate their job in America

20
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,100
The majority of people don't like what they're doing

21
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,140
Because they are really not doing it because they didn't have a goal and followed this goal

22
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:59,620
They're just aimlessly drift around and then there's a job opening so they get their job because you have to work

23
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,740
But then when you work it's a chore

24
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,840
It's work

25
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,590
It's not fun

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:11,200
So if you think about only a quarter of the people really enjoy what they're doing in life

27
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,959
So people always ask me

28
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,680
When they saw me in the gym in the pumping iron days, they say why is it that you're working out so hard?

29
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,060
Five hours a day six hours a day and you have always a smile on your face

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,620
The others are working out just as hard as you do and they look sour in the face

31
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,640
Why is that?

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,500
And I told people all the time because to me I am shooting for a goal

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,120
In front of me is the Mr Universe title

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,080
So every rep that I do gets me closer to accomplishing the goal to make this goal, this vision turn into reality

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,680
Every single set that I do

36
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,540
Every repetition every weight that i lift will get me a step closer to turning this goal into reality

37
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,580
So I couldn't wait to do another 500 pound squat. I couldn't wait to do another 500 pound benchpress

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,720
I couldn't wait to do another 2,000 reps of sit-ups. I couldn't wait for the next exercise

39
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,820
So let me tell you something visualizing your goal and going after it makes it fun

40
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,919
You got to have a purpose no matter what you do in life. You got to have the purpose

41
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,340
Mohammed Ali

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Worked his butt off

43
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:35,909
And I saw it firsthand

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,339
Now remember that there was a sports writer

45
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,019
That was there in the gym, and he was working out he was doing situps

46
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,600
And asked him how many sit-ups do you do?

47
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,940
And he said I don't start counting until it hurts

48
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,000
Now think about that, he doesn't start counting his situps and he feels pain

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,480
That's when he starts counting

50
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,140
That is working hard

51
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,960
And so you can't get around the hard work, it doesn't matter who it is

52
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,440
Work your ass off. There is no magic pill

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,920
There is no magic out there

54
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,980
You cannot get around you have to work and work and work

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,340
You have this make sure of that in order stuff. So it's work

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,140
And it drives me crazy when people say that I don't have enough time

57
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,580
To go to the gym

58
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,620
For 45 minutes a day and work out

59
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:44,500
Or to do something for 45 minutes to an hour a day to improve if it is physically improve or if it is mentally to improve

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,580
Imagine you read one hour a day

61
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,040
About history

62
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,940
How much you will learn after 365 hours.  in one year

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:05,200
Think about if you study about the history of musicians of composers how much you would know?

64
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,740
Imagine if you would work on the business and some business that you want to develop every day for an hour

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,740
imagine how further along you will go and get

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,380
So it drives me nuts because when people say they don't have the time. We have 24 hours a day

67
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,740
We sleep six hours a day. So that gives you still 18 hours

68
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,020
There's someone shaking the head out here in front to say probably I don't sleep 6 hours. I sleep eight hours, right?

69
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:46,440
Or just sleep faster. So we have 18 hours a day. The average person works around 8 to 10 hours

70
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,680
So, let's assume it's 10 hours so we have 8 hours left then you travel around an hour a day

71
00:05:52,860 --> 00:06:00,480
Maybe two hours a day. So now you have still six hours left. So what are you doing with this six hours?

72
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:07,160
Maybe eat a little bit. Maybe schmooze a little bit

73
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:16,120
Talk a little bit to people and all that stuff, but you can see how much time is available if you organize your day

74
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,760
So you got the work hard

75
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,980
I hate Plan B

76
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,180
I tell you why

77
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:37,340
Because we have so many doubters as I've said earlier the no sayers

78
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,580
We have so many of those people who say no, you can't do it, that's impossible

79
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,320
That is okay because we just turn off as I said earlier and bees

80
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:54,199
Listen and be hear that no being a yes. You can't do it do it. You can do it and all that

81
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,580
So that that is possible to do that

82
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,380
amongst all the negative people around you but when you start doubting yourself

83
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:13,200
That's very dangerous because now what you're basically saying is is that if my plan doesn't work

84
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,820
I have a fallback plan. I have a plan B

85
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,160
And that means that you start thinking about Plan B and every thought that you put into Plan B

86
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,180
you're taking away now that thought and that energy from plan a

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,960
And it's very important

88
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,700
To understand that we function better

89
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:51,620
If there is no safety net because Plan B becomes a safety net. It says that if I fail

90
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,180
Then a fall and I get picked up and I have something else there that means they will protect me

91
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,980
And that's not good because people perform better when there's no safety net

92
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,160
People perform better in sports and everything else if you don't have a plan B

93
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm telling you I've never ever

94
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,760
had a plan B I

95
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,339
I made a full commitment that I'm gonna be a bodybuilding champion. I made a full commitment that I'm gonna be in America

96
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,160
I made a full commitment that I'm gonna get in the show business

97
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,120
And I'm going to be a leading man. No matter what it takes. I will do the work.

98
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I will do the work over and over and over, until I get it

99
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:42,240
The same as in politics and everything like that. So to me, it is very dangerous

100
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,220
to have a plan B because you're cutting yourself off from

101
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,960
the chance of really succeeding and the reason one of the main reasons why people want to have a plan B is

102
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,380
Because they are worried about failing

103
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,180
What is if I fail then I don't have anything else

104
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,680
Well, let me tell you something. Don't be afraid of failing

105
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,060
Because there's nothing wrong with failing

106
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,560
You have to fail in order to climb that ladder

107
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,860
There's no one that doesn't fail Michael Jordan said in one of his interviews

108
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,780
When they said "you're unbelievable the greatest basketball player of all times"

109
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,620
I mean tell me about that. And then he said "Well, you just mentioned the successes"

110
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,780
But he says "for me to become the greatest basketball player I missed"

111
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,980
"nine thousand shots"

112
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,460
"When I was playing basketball in the NBA games"

113
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:48,360
So during this games that he was so successful he missed nine thousand shots

114
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:56,820
Does it make him a failure? No, he is one of the greatest basketball players are four times, but he failed

115
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,760
9,000 times. Do you get it?

116
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,560
We all fail. It's okay.

117
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,760
What is not ok is when you fail you stay down

118
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,640
Whoever stays down is a loser

119
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:29,420
And winners will fail and get up fail and get up, fail and get up, you always get up that is

120
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,580
a winner

121
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
That is a winner

122
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,220
I failed in bodybuilding. I lost bodybuilding competitions

123
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,520
I lost powerlifting competitions and lost weightlifting competitions

124
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,620
I had movies that went in the toilet that were terrible. It got the worst reviews

125
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:57,580
And in politics, I remember I had many of the initiatives and the ballot

126
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,420
And we lost

127
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:06,360
My approval rating in California went down to 28% and

128
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,120
Then it went back up again and I won again the governorship

129
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,740
Hey, we all lose

130
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,880
If you all have lost as this is okay, and this is why I say don't

131
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,800
Be worried about losing because when you're afraid of losing then you get frozen

132
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,180
You get stiff you're not relaxed. You got to be in order to perform

133
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,500
Well in anything if it's in boxing or if it is on your job or with your thinking

134
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,060
Is only happening when you relax

135
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,300
So relax, it's okay to fail

136
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:46,020
Let's just go all out and give it everything that you got. That's what it is all about. So don't be afraid to fail
