349
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,410
and I can't believe she actually reacted.

350
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:07,150
I'm such a fan of Billie like, I've done

351
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,040
so many of her songs.

352
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,810
I even wrote a song, like with her lyrics.

353
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,020
I used to do them on piano,

354
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,750
this is the only one with guitar.

355
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,300
I was a little more
nervous to share that one

356
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,380
'cause I never do it on guitar

357
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,970
but I'm glad she liked it.

358
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,190

how can I look the best.

379
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,550
That's so not what it's
about, like it's art.

380
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,540
You know I've always had
this thing, since like,

381
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,250
the beginning of when
I started making music

382
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,920
where I don't care if I look pretty,

383
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,270
I just want it to be artistically perfect.

384
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,640
You can already tell that
that requires so much talent

385
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,530
to be able to like sit there

386
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,660
and do every single part yourself,

387
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,802
that is impressive as hell.

390
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,222
- I fuck with the vision.

391
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,670
- Aw, this is really cool.

392
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,140
- Humans are so used to what we know

393
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,320
that when we see something
that we haven't seen before

394
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,540
we automatically feel uncomfortable

395
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,160
with it, which is stupid.

396
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,970
Richie, bro, that is impressive as hell.

397
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,340
- I'm happy that she liked it,

398
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,970
I think she is one of the few

399
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,670
that kind of fiercely is herself.

400
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,210
It's really good to promote
that kind of artistry.

401
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,080
Thank you so very much
for watching my video,

410
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,740
That's your song then, I
don't wanna say it's my song.

411
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,780
Yeah, I made it, I wrote it, I sang it,

412
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,320
but it's your song, from here on out.

413
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,480
It's such a beautiful
thing that you can just

414
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,465
take art that was created out of love

415
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:44,870
from that person and love
it for your own reasons.

416
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,062
