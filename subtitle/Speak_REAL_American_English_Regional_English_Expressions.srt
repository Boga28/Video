00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,140
Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,410
Do Americans have different accents?

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,160
Let's talk about it.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,650
A lot of students ask me, "Vanessa, what is
your accent?

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:26,130
You're from the US, but you don't sound like
you're specifically from a certain region.

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,230
What's your accent?"

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:33,490
Well, it's kind of true because I generally
speak with what's called a standard American

8
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,560
accent.

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,310
And this is the accent that you might hear
on TV.

10
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,600
An accent that you might hear, a Hollywood
celebrity use.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,520
Maybe something that you would hear someone
like Ellen DeGeneres speak with.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,920
It is a standard American accent that is not
specific to one region or another.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,060
I'm not exactly sure why this developed in
me because I live in the South of the US.

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,700
Maybe it's because I'm originally from the
North of the US and I moved to the South,

15
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,580
and my parents don't really have a strong
accent one way or the other.

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,970
Who knows?

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,170
But for whatever reason, this is the way that
I speak.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,070
But there are definitely different accents
and different ways of speaking around the

19
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,160
US.

20
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,400
The biggest difference that is often found
around the US is vocabulary choice.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,840
And today I have a fun little lesson for you.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,960
I'd like to introduce you to some words and
phrases that people in different regions of

23
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,780
the United States use.

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,440
And if someone uses one of these phrases,
other people might automatically know, "Ah,

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,720
that's where you're from."

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,780
Because these words and phrases are commonly
known to be specific to those areas or maybe

27
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,180
someone from another area might say, "What?

28
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,460
What did you say?"

29
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,730
They might not even know the phrase at all.

30
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,409
So I would like to introduce you to these.

31
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,820
And if you are from the US and you are watching
these, let me know in the comments is this

32
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
true for you?

33
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,970
From where you're from?

34
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:02,970
Let me know.

35
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,140
It would be always in interesting to find
out.

36
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,270
And to help you never forget what you're going
to learn today about regional English expressions

37
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:15,670
in the US, you can download this free PDF
guide that I've created for you with all of

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,100
the expressions, the regions that they're
used in, some ways that you can use them.

39
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,510
And also at the end of the free worksheet,
you can answer Vanessa's challenge question.

40
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,680
So I hope this will be useful to you.

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,450
You can download it, print it out, put it
under your pillow and sleep on it.

42
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,480
I hope it will be a useful tool for you.

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,650
All right, let's get started with the first
set of regional expressions depending on where

44
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,420
you're from, you might use these.

45
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,120
How do you refer to a group of people?

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,880
This is a problem with the English language.

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,980
We don't have one specific word for a group
of people.

48
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,730
So it depends where you're from.

49
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:54,670
If you're from the South where I live, you
say y'all, y'all.

50
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,580
Y'all ready?

51
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,700
Do you want to meet up later?

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,700
I don't know.

53
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,970
What's y'all doing?

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,040
Y'all.

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,099
But if you're not from the South, you might
say you guys.

56
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,110
What you guys doing?

57
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,099
What you guys doing?

58
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:11,900
This is common in the North and in various
other areas of the US.

59
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,069
This is actually the one that I say the most.

60
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:19,330
Maybe it's because my origins are in the North
and that's the way that my parents speak.

61
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:22,100
But it's common to say you guys in the North.

62
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,370
If you're from the Northeast, you might hear
youse, youse.

63
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,849
This is so creative because here we have the
singular you, what are you doing?

64
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,130
And then we have the plural.

65
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,140
It just adds an S. Oh, great.

66
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,709
That's what we do in English.

67
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,420
Cat, cats.

68
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,140
You, youse.

69
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,860
Maybe we should make that a more common word.

70
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:48,830
But if you are from the city of Pittsburgh,
now Pittsburgh is actually where I am originally

71
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:53,310
from, but this is not a word that I say in
my daily life, but it brings back some nice

72
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,099
memories of my family members who live there.

73
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,740
You might say yinz, yinz.

74
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,230
And this is kind of a fun Pittsburgh word
because often we refer to people from Pittsburgh

75
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,010
as yinzers.

76
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,520
If you're from Pittsburgh, you're a yinzer.

77
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,959
And it's just because the word yinz is so
common in that area.

78
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,529
So in conclusion, we could say where y'all
want to eat tonight?

79
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,249
Where do you guys want to eat tonight?

80
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,669
Where youse want to eat tonight?

81
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:24,309
Where yinz to eat tonight?

82
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,259
All of these are acceptable.

83
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:29,110
What do you call this fizzy drink?

84
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,889
If you're from the North, you might say pop,
pop.

85
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,180
And this is what I said when my family first
moved to the South and people kind of laughed

86
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,159
at me a little bit and said, "What?

87
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:41,220
You want to drink a pop?"

88
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,740
Because it's pretty typical of the North of
the US.

89
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:50,639
And in the South of the US, people are more
likely to say soda or Coke.

90
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,159
So this one is a little bit strange because
the brand is Coca-Cola.

91
00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:01,099
But when you go to a restaurant in the South,
your waitress might ask you, "What do you

92
00:05:01,099 --> 00:05:02,490
want to drink?"

93
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,090
And you might say, "I would like a Coke."

94
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:10,659
Okay, well, if you're in another area of the
US they would bring you Coca-Cola.

95
00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:17,240
But in the South, if you say, "I want a Coke,"
the waitress will then ask you, "What kind

96
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,479
of Coke?"

97
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,270
Oh, and you might say Dr. Pepper, Sprite.

98
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,900
So this word Coke can cover the general category
of soda.

99
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,680
It's a very interesting little change here
in the South.

100
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,869
What do you call this sandwich?

101
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:39,710
Well, in most of the US, we call this a sub,
a sub sandwich, and this word has become popularized

102
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,039
by the restaurant franchise Subway.

103
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,479
It's a sub sandwich.

104
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:50,569
But if you're from certain areas especially
the Northeast specifically in Philadelphia,

105
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:53,719
you might call this a hoagie, a hoagie.

106
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:55,039
Sometimes I also call it this.

107
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,430
Maybe it's because this word has also leached
into the Pittsburgh area where my parents

108
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,430
are from.

109
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:06,810
So maybe I sometimes say hoagie, but these
words have a little bit of gray area because

110
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,759
people in the US move around a lot so we have
origins in a lot of different places.

111
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,120
In New York, you might hear this called a
hero, a hero.

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,979
And if you're from the upper Midwest, you
might call this a Dagwood.

113
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:25,219
If you're from the upper Midwest, let me know
if this is something that is commonly used

114
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,909
in daily life, but this type of sandwich has
many different names.

115
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:35,059
When you go to the grocery store, you push
a cart.

116
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:39,819
A cart is what people in the North us would
say and it's kind of more general English

117
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:40,819
as well.

118
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:44,909
But if you are from the South, you would call
this a buggy, a buggy.

119
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,569
This is a very Southern word.

120
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,009
I love to hear my Southern neighbors say,
"I was pushing the buggy."

121
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:53,360
The buggy, that's what that is called.

122
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,099
But in the Northeast, this can also be called
a carriage, a carriage.

123
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:04,580
Now to me, a carriage is something that maybe
a king or queen would ride in a big carriage

124
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,939
or a fairy tale princess was in a carriage
led by horses, but in the Northeast of the

125
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:12,680
US that is just a shopping cart.

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,409
When you want to buy liquor, hard alcohol,
not wine, not beer.

127
00:07:18,409 --> 00:07:20,119
Where do you go in the US?

128
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:26,469
Well, you need to go to a specific store because
in a lot of states you cannot buy rum or whiskey

129
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,240
or other types of hard alcohol in the grocery
store.

130
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,279
In some places you can buy beer and wine in
the grocery store, but the US is a little

131
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:38,050
bit particular when it comes to alcohol.

132
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,360
You have to go to a specific store.

133
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,969
And what do you call that store?

134
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,800
Depends where you live.

135
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,830
So if you live in the North of the US or in
most of the US, you might call this a liquor

136
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:53,099
store, a liquor store.

137
00:07:53,099 --> 00:08:02,159
But here in the South of the US, we call this
in ABC store and is because it is run by the

138
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:03,240
government.

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:10,729
It is kind of regulated by the government
so it's like an alcoholic beverage company?

140
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,659
Cooperation?

141
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,400
Something like this.

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,369
And it is run by the government and regulated
by the government.

143
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:26,939
And if you saw a video that I made with Lucy
and Emma last year, I got lit in two by calling

144
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:29,639
this an ABC store.

145
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,830
There were hundreds of comments in this video
that we made that said, "That's not an ABC

146
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,590
store that's a liquor store in the US."

147
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,479
And you know what?

148
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,479
It's both.

149
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,240
So if you have not seen that video that shows
differences between British, American and

150
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,780
Australian English, I recommend checking it
out and you can see how I said that in the

151
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,720
US we call it an ABC store and really that's
the South of the US.

152
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,060
But there are a couple other words we use
to describe this type of store in the Northeast

153
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:01,700
of the US, it can be called a package store,
a package store.

154
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,370
Now I've never lived in those areas so if
you are from those areas, let me know if that

155
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,680
is the most common word that you use and a
diminutive of that in Boston sometimes people

156
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,870
say a packie, a packie.

157
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,600
It's kind of like a cute word.

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,010
I'm going to go to the packie.

159
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,950
It sounds so cute to me.

160
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,520
So you might say do you want to run to the
liquor store and buy some whiskey?

161
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,700
Do you want to run to the ABC store and buy
some whiskey?

162
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,420
Do you want to run to the package store?

163
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,870
Do you want to run to the packie and buy some
whiskey?

164
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,200
There's a lot of different words we can use.

165
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,810
When you want to go for a run or do some exercise,
you need to put on some?

166
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,100
Well, it depends where you're from.

167
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,870
If you're from generally the North of the
US, you'll say sneakers.

168
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,470
I need to put on my sneakers.

169
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:53,340
But for me, I'm from the South of the US,
the word sneakers feels a little bit old fashioned.

170
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,760
It kind of feels like something my grandma
might say.

171
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,880
And instead for me and for the rest of the
US, we say tennis shoes, tennis shoes.

172
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,480
Usually this word gets kind of linked together.

173
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,510
Tennis shoes, that S at the end of tennis
kind of gets forgotten, tennis shoes.

174
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,420
It's not because we're all playing tennis
all the time.

175
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,680
It actually has nothing to do with tennis.

176
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,730
Instead it's just these shoes and we call
them tennis shoes.

177
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,410
You can use them for running, for hiking,
for basketball, for any kind of exercise or

178
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,410
just being comfortable.

179
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,960
I'm going to put on my tennis shoes.

180
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,560
In the US, most kids love going to the bank.

181
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,860
Hmm, why would they like to go to bank?

182
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,540
The bank's kind of boring for kids, right?

183
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,560
Actually, it's because it's kind of a little
tradition that at the bank, the teller will

184
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,210
give kids a?

185
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,470
This is almost ubiquitous.

186
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:56,130
At every bank, tellers give kids depending
on where you're from, you might call this

187
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,990
a sucker, a sucker.

188
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,990
Because what do you do?

189
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,170
You suck on it and that's how you eat it.

190
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:08,200
This is common in the South and the Midwest,
but the rest of the US calls this a lollipop,

191
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,590
a lollipop.

192
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:15,350
You will hear the word lollipop in the South,
but it's more common when you go into a bank.

193
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,850
If that person is really from the South, they
might say, "Do you want to sucker?

194
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,770
Can I give your kid a sucker?"

195
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,770
Extremely common.

196
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,670
What's one of the most intimidating things.

197
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,850
When you're driving?

198
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,750
Passing one of these things.

199
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,330
Well, what are these called?

200
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,540
Well, there's a couple different words we
can use.

201
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,280
In the Northeast, you can call it a tractor
trailer.

202
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,460
And this is kind of the more technical term.

203
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:42,020
You might know that my four-year-old son is
obsessed with trucks so we have a lot of books

204
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,190
that talk about trucks and a term that they
often use is tractor trailer.

205
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,660
I think this is kind of the more specific
or technical term.

206
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,450
But if you're from the South of the US, you
might call this an 18 wheeler.

207
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,870
So growing up, this is what I said.

208
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,390
I said, "Oh, there's an 18 wheeler."

209
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,070
Or you try to make the 18 wheelers honk by
going like this.

210
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,830
It's kind of a kid tradition.

211
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:08,780
Does this happen in your country that when
you're driving along and there's an 18 wheeler

212
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:13,820
passing you, you go like this because that's
how they honk the horn is there's like a little

213
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,910
thing that they pull.

214
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:18,790
At least I assume so because that's what we
did as kids, you do this and all the kids

215
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:24,190
are looking out the window and you hope that
the driver will honk the horn and then everybody

216
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,190
cheers.

217
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:30,810
It's quite exciting, but there's another word
we can use and that is semi, semi.

218
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,150
This is common everywhere around the US.

219
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,510
We would call this a semi.

220
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,850
So intimidating to pass a semi on the road.

221
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:45,800
It's so intimidating to pass a tractor trailer
or to pass an 18 wheeler.

222
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,360
Have you ever felt like that?

223
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,380
If you're going on a camping trip, you might
need to buy a of ice to put in a cooler so

224
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,750
that you can keep your food cold.

225
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,130
Hmm, what would you call this?

226
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:03,040
Well, in most of the US, it's called a bag,
just a bag.

227
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,830
But in the South of the US, in some places
in the Midwest as well, it's called a sack,

228
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,830
a sack.

229
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,240
Now I have a funny story to share with you
about this.

230
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,470
Dan, my husband, his grandfather is from Texas
and has a very strong Texas accent.

231
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,270
And he's quite tall.

232
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,070
He's 6'2".

233
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,100
I don't know what that would be in meters,
but he's very tall and he is kind of big,

234
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,120
and he was visiting the North of the US where
Dan's family is originally from.

235
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,960
And he walked into a grocery store and he
said with a very strong Texas accent, this

236
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,520
big guy said, "I want sack of ice.

237
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,580
Where can I find it?

238
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,350
I want a sack of ice."

239
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,000
So he said a sack of ice.

240
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,470
He wanted to buy a bag of ice to keep some
food cold.

241
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:54,050
But the way that he said it sounded a lot
like sacrifice.

242
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,670
So the poor cashier is looking at this guy
saying, "You want a sacrifice?

243
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,670
What?"

244
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:07,450
It was just a misunderstanding and they kind
of laughed about it for a moment, but it is

245
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,400
a common word that's used in the South compared
to bag is a sack.

246
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,700
And you will hear the word bag used in the
South, but it's common to say sack as well.

247
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,390
In general, there are three meals: breakfast,
lunch, and?

248
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,390
Hmm?

249
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,660
Well, it depends on where you're from.

250
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,860
If you are from the North or the West of the
US, you just say dinner, I'm going to eat

251
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,900
some dinner.

252
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:36,080
But if you're from the South and some places
in the Midwest, you might say supper, supper.

253
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,350
This is something that's really common in
the South.

254
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,430
Time to eat supper.

255
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,430
We're going to eat supper.

256
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:45,680
Now, this is a word that even though I live
in the South, I don't really use.

257
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,510
I don't feel like I'm Southern enough to use
this word.

258
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:54,160
Maybe it's because my family is really from
the North and I don't have strong origins

259
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,500
in the South, but the word supper is extremely
common and kind of makes my heart warm when

260
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,740
I think about it, because I remember all of
my Southern neighbors who say this and it

261
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,740
feels so nice.

262
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,990
You're going to eat some supper.

263
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,280
Our three final expressions that are regional
expressions are kind of fun.

264
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,840
The next one is bless your heart.

265
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,960
Now this doesn't really mean anything specific
in the rest of the US.

266
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,580
It just means, oh, I appreciate you.

267
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
Thanks.

268
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,580
Great.

269
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,580
It's a positive thing.

270
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,200
It's not said as often, but in the South,
I want you to know if you hear bless your

271
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,970
heart usually it means you're an idiot.

272
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,270
It's not a compliment.

273
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:40,850
So for example, let's say that you are going
to a baby shower.

274
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,880
This is like a little party to celebrate someone
who's going to have a baby.

275
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:52,130
And everyone brings some food and there is
a little Southern grandma and she's eating

276
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,270
a brownie.

277
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,056
And she eats it and goes, "Oh, who made these?"

278
00:15:57,056 --> 00:15:59,080
And you say, "Oh, I made those.

279
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,960
Those are vegan brownies."

280
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,850
And she says, "Oh, bless your heart."

281
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:12,180
This means she thinks those are terrible brownies,
but I'm going to say it in such a nice way.

282
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:17,500
This is kind of a hidden Southern expression
that if you hear it, make sure you keep in

283
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,350
mind all of those things because it's commonly
used in the South.

284
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,150
In fact, there's a really funny video on YouTube.

285
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,440
If you type in bless your heart It's a Southern
Thing.

286
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,730
This is a YouTube channel.

287
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,870
It's a Southern Thing.

288
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:36,530
You will see a hilarious video about all of
the different scenarios where people use bless

289
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,650
your heart in the South.

290
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,970
Quite funny and it's a good way to learn about
culture as well.

291
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,440
The next regional phrase is give me some sugar.

292
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,970
Okay, well you can't say it exactly like that
because this is common of Southern grandmas.

293
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,190
Maybe I'm partial to the South and know more
things about the South.

294
00:16:53,190 --> 00:17:00,210
But if a Southern grandma said give me some
sugar to you, does she mean to pass the sugar?

295
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,210
No.

296
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,100
She means to give her a little kiss.

297
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,059
Give me some sugar, my little grandbabies.

298
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,519
Give me a kiss.

299
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:12,859
So she's asking for a kiss, but in the rest
of the US if someone said, give me the sugar,

300
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,859
give me some sugar.

301
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:17,458
It means literally sugar, something sweet.

302
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,990
And our final regional expression is being
ugly.

303
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:27,039
Hmm, if someone said stop being so ugly, would
you think, "Oh no.

304
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,549
Is it my hair?

305
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,000
Did I forget to wash my face this morning?"

306
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,740
Hmm, if you're from the North or the rest
of the US it's about physical appearance.

307
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,299
To be ugly is about physical appearance.

308
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,730
But in the South, this has a special meaning.

309
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:50,169
If we say stop being so ugly, this means stop
being so mean or rude.

310
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,799
This is something that parents often say to
their children.

311
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,490
Stop being so ugly to each other, just get
along and play.

312
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,320
Stop being so ugly.

313
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,169
So ugly has more of a figurative sense here.

314
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:06,649
Your actions are ugly because you're being
rude to each other.

315
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:07,970
So stop being so ugly.

316
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,240
This is a fun regional expression as well.

317
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,919
I hope you enjoyed all of these fun regional
expressions from the US.

318
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,090
If you're from the US, let me know of more
in the comments or if you agree or disagree

319
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,759
with what I've said.

320
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,100
And don't forget, you can always download
the free PDF for today's lesson so that you

321
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,559
can remember all of these regional expressions.

322
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,070
And you can understand where people are from
based on what they say.

323
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,350
And you can also answer Vanessa's challenge
question at the bottom of the PDF.

324
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,299
And now I have a question for you.
