00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,380
Hi. Welcome to this English lesson on phrasal
verbs where I'm going to act out over

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,820
25 phrasal verbs.

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:12,440
By the way, act out is already your first
phrasal verb for this video.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,840
When you act something out, you use all of
your skills to demonstrate through actions

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,220
what the word means.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,050
So hopefully I can act out these verbs really,
really well for you.

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,401
I think though, before we kick off this video,
by the way, that's your second phrasal verb

8
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:30,401
already.

9
00:00:30,401 --> 00:00:34,289
When you kick something off, it means that
you start or begin it.

10
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:38,120
But before we kick off this video, if you
are new here, don't forget to subscribe by

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,289
clicking that red button below.

12
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,320
And as you watch this video, if it helps you
learn a little bit of English, give me a thumbs

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,020
up.

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,340
So ever since I had heart surgery, I feel
like it's very important to work out as much

15
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,460
as I can.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,609
I usually lift some weights.

17
00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:00,370
But when I work out, I also do some walking,
and I do some running.

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:06,260
You want to be careful though when you're
working out because if you work out too hard,

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,940
you might black out.

20
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,460
I'm okay.

21
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,850
So my friend Nao from China gave me this gift
and I’ve been practicing quite a bit and

22
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:22,700
I thought today I would show off a little
bit.

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:29,740
When you show off it’s when you do something
so that people will admire you.

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,591
So thanks a lot for this gift Nao.

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,680
The whole family has been playing with it
a lot.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,600
So this tire is a little bit flat so I need
to pump up this tire.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,299
In order to pump up this tire though, I need
to bend over so I can reach down here and

28
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:52,700
I will put this on and I will pump up the
tire.

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,060
I don't want to pump it up too much though.

30
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,280
If I put too much air in, the tire might blow
up and we don't want that to happen.

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,960
So sometimes I need to pick things up that
won't fit in my van.

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,459
When that happens, I need to hook up my trailer.

33
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:14,760
When I hook up my trailer, I can take it where
I need to go and I can pick up really big

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,030
things.

35
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,519
So a couple of days ago we had a really bad
wind storm and it knocked some branches off

36
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:23,110
this tree.

37
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:30,110
Some though, are still partially attached,
so I'm going to have to cut off this branch

38
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,780
because it's dead.

39
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,150
Luckily though the tree is still alive.

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:41,970
I'm very happy about that because I certainly
don't want to cut down the whole tree, so

41
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,819
I'm really happy the tree is still alive.

42
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:47,930
But when I look at this job, it seems like
a lot of work.

43
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:53,099
I wonder if I should call up my brother and
see if he can come and help.

44
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,319
I really hope though, when I'm cutting branches
off this tree that there aren't any bees.

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,180
If there are, I might need to run away.

46
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,720
You know cutting branches off that tree was a lot of
hard work.

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,500
I might just nod off for a little bit on this
bench.

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:22,181
So sometimes we will have a hose across our
driveway because we're watering flowers, but

49
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,600
we don't want anyone to drive across it.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:32,310
So we will block off this area by putting
a few things there that will stop people from

51
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,319
doing that.

52
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,480
Now the driveway is blocked off.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,930
So is there someone you know that you want
to cheer up?

54
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,890
Sometimes buying someone something, will cheer
them up.

55
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:48,629
I highly recommend if you need to cheer someone
up that you buy them flowers.

56
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,950
These are called lisianthus if you were wondering,
and these certainly cheer people up.

57
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,189
Go kids go, run really fast.

58
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:00,620
Sometimes my kids have races and I like to
cheer them on.

59
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,430
When you cheer on someone it means to give
them encouragement for what they're doing.

60
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,110
Good job.

61
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,239
So Jen grows a lot of different kinds of flowers
and every once in a while I come across a

62
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,060
flower that I didn't actually know that we
grew.

63
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,600
This flower here, I think it's called a Cosmo.

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,000
It's really fun to sometimes come across new
flowers out in the flower field.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,910
Come on, hurry up, run, hurry up.

66
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,130
We need to get this video done fast because
my kids want me to take them to the pool this

67
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,930
afternoon so I need to hurry up and I need
to get this video done.

68
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:44,100
So sometimes at work we have events where
we need to dress up, where we need to wear

69
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,630
clothes that are a little nicer than our everyday
clothes.

70
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,240
Usually for a guy that means wearing a shirt
and tie, but we have other days where we don't

71
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,500
have to dress up where we are allowed to ....

72
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:04,180
..dress down. Sometimes at work we have a dress down day
where we're allowed to wear more casual clothes,

73
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,190
like a T-shirt.

74
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,430
When you dress down it means you wear clothes
that are more casual than what you would normally

75
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,430
wear.

76
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,530
And if you're wondering, yes, almost every
shirt I own has a little bit of blue in it

77
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,850
somewhere.

78
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:23,280
So the other day I threw my car keys in this
box and now I have to go through this box

79
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,600
to see if I can find them.

80
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,310
I need to go through this box so that I can
find my car keys.

81
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:38,080
So sometimes when my kids are outside having
a snack, there will be a cat that will hang

82
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,100
around.

83
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,620
This cat's name is Tigger and this cat likes
to hang around because it thinks that some

84
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,180
food might fall on the ground.

85
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,350
This store has a great coupon that lets me
get 50% off my next purchase.

86
00:05:52,350 --> 00:06:00,580
So I am going to cut out this coupon and I'm
going to put it in my wallet.

87
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,630
Well it's lunchtime.

88
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,099
So I'm going to cut up some cucumber.

89
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:11,199
I like to eat cucumber every day, but I like
to cut up the cucumber so that it's easier

90
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,729
to eat.

91
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:18,199
So after we use the flower pails once, we
usually line up the pails to get ready to

92
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,220
wash them.

93
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,370
We need to wash the pails each time.

94
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,610
So it's nice to line up the pails so you know
what order to wash them in.

95
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,000
So this is Jen's flower studio and we put
these lights in to light up this area.

96
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,680
It used to be a little bit darker in here
and it was hard to make bouquets and it was

97
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,509
hard to arrange flowers.

98
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:44,319
So this light works really well to light up
the area where Jen has to work.

99
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,770
Well, hey that was 25 phrasal verbs acted
out as best as I could.

100
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,500
I hope this English lesson helped you learn
just a little bit more English that you can

101
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,230
use in your daily life.

102
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,110
Bob, the Canadian here, you are learning English
with Bob the Canadian.

103
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,590

106
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,220
Thanks for this gift Nao.

107
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,610
It’s been a hit with my family.

108
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,180
Everyone has been playing with it.

109
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:25,410
And it’s fun to kind of show off a little
bit the trick, the one trick, that I know

110
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,159
how to do.
