00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,060
Hi, I'm Gina. Welcome to Oxford Online English!

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:16,970
Where do you live? 
Do you live in a small town, a big city, or a remote village?

3
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,520
What’s it like?

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,680
In this lesson, you can learn how to describe
your hometown in English.

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,420
Let’s start with some basic English vocabulary 
You can use to talk about your hometown.

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,520
Part one: introducing your hometown.

7
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,860
Let’s start with a simple sentence.

8
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,700
"I live in a ________."

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,760
What could you say? You could say something like:

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:01:02,280
"I live in a city"; "I live in a town"; "I live in a village."

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,860
That’s a good start, but it’s very basic.
Let’s add a bit more detail.

12
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,240
What’s it called? How big is it?

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:27,500
"I live in Paris. It’s the capital city";
"I live in Shanghai. It’s a huge city";

14
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:39,540
"I live in a small town. It’s called Banbury";
"I live in Manarola, which is a tiny village by the sea."

15
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:46,600
Better! You should always try to add more details
 when you speak.

16
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:57,540
What about you? Where do you live? 
Can you make one or two sentences like this?

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,120
Pause the video and practice!

18
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:11,660
Okay, let’s move on. 
We need to make ouranswers more detailed and interesting.

19
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,080
Part two: adding background and details.

20
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,280
Think about these questions:

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:30,640
What’s your hometown famous for?
Can you think of some words you could use to describe your hometown?

22
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,740
How long have you lived there?

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,880
Add these ideas to your answer to make it
longer and more detailed. For example:

24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:55,540
"I live in Paris, the capital city. 
It’s famous for its landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower,

25
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:04,920
Notre Dame Cathedral or the Louvre.
It’s also well-known for its food, of course!"

26
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:13,140
"I live in Shanghai. It’s a huge, bustling, international city.

27
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,800
People from all over the world live and work there."

28
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:28,140
"I live in a small town called Banbury. 
I’ve been living there for about five years,

29
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,540
since I finished university.

30
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,620
It’s a pretty sleepy place, to be honest."

31
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:42,800
Let’s look at some useful vocabulary from these examples: Which you can use when you speak.

32
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,220
We said:

33
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,500
Paris is famous for its landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower.

34
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:59,120
Landmarks are famous places or buildings,
like the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Sydney

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,980
Opera House or Christ the Redeemer in Rio.

36
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:13,609
Does your hometown have any famous landmarks?
What are they called in English?

37
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,540
Next, we said:

38
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,280
"Shanghai is a bustling city."

39
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,740
Do you know what this means?

40
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,900
It means there’s a lot of activity.

41
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:34,120
There are lots of people, lots of traffic, lots of life and energy.

42
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:46,240
Is your city bustling or sleepy? 
If a town is sleepy there’s not much activity and things are quiet.

43
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:54,720
What about your hometown. 
Look at our questions again:

44
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:03,800
What’s your hometown famous for?
Can you think of some words you could use to describe your hometown?

45
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,980
How long have you lived there?

46
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:19,840
What could you say about your hometown? 
Pause the video and try to make 2-3 sentences.

47
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,440
Okay? Let’s look at our next point.

48
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,800
Part three: Saying what you like about your hometown.

49
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:39,880
What’s good about your hometown? 
What do you like most about it?

50
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,000
Different people like different things in a city or town.

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,340
Let’s look at some example  sentences which express positive feelings:

52
00:05:52,340 --> 00:06:01,600
"I love living in Paris. It’s got such a rich culture and there’s always something interesting going on."

53
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:12,500
"Shanghai’s a great place to live. 
It’s a real 24-hour city and you can meet people from all over the world."

54
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,980
"Living in Banbury suits me. 
It’s a quiet place

55
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:25,880
and it’s small enough that you can get to know your neighbours and have a sense of community."

56
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,640
What’s important for you?

57
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,760
Do you want to live somewhere with a rich culture and a sense of history,

58
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,600
or do you prefer more modern, international cities?

59
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,140
Would you rather live somewhere larger and more energetic,

60
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,540
or somewhere smaller and more peaceful?

61
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,520
Think about these ideas. You’ll need them in a minute!

62
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,080
Let’s look at some useful language from our examples:

63
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:14,840
"I love living in _______"; "_______’s a great place to live"; "Living in _______ suits me."

64
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,380
Of course, you can change these to say what you want to:

65
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:28,000
"I quite like living in _______"; "I really like living in ________";

66
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,220
"I suppose I don’t mind living in ________."

67
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,120
We also saw some useful phrases in our examples:

68
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:48,900
"It’s got such a rich culture";
"There’s always something interesting going on";

69
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:57,700
"It’s a real 24-hour city"; 
"You can meet people from all over the world";

70
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,280
"It’s small enough that you can get to know your neighbours"

71
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,020
and have a sense of community

72
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,960
What does that last phrase mean?

73
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,940
If you have a sense of community,

74
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:22,380
it means people know their neighbours 
and feel like they belong to a wider community.

75
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,360
Smaller towns and villages often have a better sense of community,

76
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,159
perhaps because people have more time to talk to each other and do things together.

77
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:44,159
What about your hometown? 
Could you use any of these phrases to describe where you live?

78
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:52,180
Next, what if you don’t like something about your hometown?

79
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,480
Part four: saying what you dislike.

80
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,440
Let’s look at some examples which express
negative feelings:

81
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:14,260
"Paris is great, but the cost of living is really high. 
That can be quite stressful

82
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,220
because you’re always thinking about money 
and how to make ends meet."

83
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,360
"Shanghai’s an exciting place,
but it’s really crowded

84
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,440
and it can be exhausting to live there.

85
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Air quality can be an issue, particularly in the summer."

86
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,220
"Banbury’s nice, but sometimes I find it a bit boring.

87
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,300
There’s not much nightlife

88
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,640
and sometimes it feels a bit cut off from the wider world."

89
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,840
When talking about things you don’t like
about your hometown.

90
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:05,600
You can use adjectives like, 'stressful', 'crowded', 'boring'.

91
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,120
You can make your answer more interesting by using phrases.

92
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,500
We saw some useful ones in our examples:

93
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,120
"The cost of living is really high"; "

94
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,440
You’re always thinking about how to make ends meet."

95
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:32,120
Meaning: you’re always thinking about  how to pay for your basic living costs.

96
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,280
"It can be exhausting to live there";

97
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,040
"Air quality can be an issue"; "

98
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:43,460
There’s not much nightlife"; "

99
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,500
It feels a bit cut off from the wider world."

100
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:55,240
Meaning: you feel like you’re far away from people, culture and activity.

101
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,000
Could you use any of these phrases to describe
your hometown?

102
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:10,500
Remember that you can also change the phrases
to fit your ideas. For example:

103
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,089
"Traffic can be an issue";

104
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,400
"There’s not much for young people to do";

105
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,440
"It can be very stressful to live here."

106
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:37,940
Okay, what about you? Try to make 3-4 sentences.
Say what you like and dislike about your hometown.

107
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,820
Use the key words and phrases from parts 3 and 4.

108
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,520
Go on, pause the video and practice!

109
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:53,630
Okay? We have one more thing to do:

110
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:59,440
Part five: describing how it’s changed over time.

111
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:07,400
What was your hometown like ten, twenty or fifty years ago?

112
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,340
How has it changed?

113
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,700
How has it changed over time?

114
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:20,440
Some places change very fast; other places never seem to change at all!

115
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:28,240
Talking about changes can add interesting and useful information to your description.

116
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,300
Let’s look:

117
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,960
"Paris has changed a lot in the last twenty years.

118
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:42,340
It’s much more international and much more expensive than it used to be.

119
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,740
However, the soul of the city is still there.

120
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,700
Paris will always be Paris!"

121
00:12:52,840 --> 00:13:00,640
"Shanghai is almost unrecognisable compared to twenty or thirty years ago.

122
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,680
The city has expanded so much, both physically and economically.

123
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,805
It’s amazing when you see old photos of the city;

124
00:13:11,805 --> 00:13:14,320
things are so different now!"

125
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,120
"Banbury hasn’t changed much as a place in the last twenty years,

126
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,240
but the mix of people is a bit different nowadays.

127
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:33,160
The population used to be older and mostly English,

128
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:43,779
whereas now there are more young people living here,
including many people from other parts of Europe."

129
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:51,290
Again, these examples contain a lot of useful
language you can use to talk about your hometown.

130
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,440
For example:

131
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,000
"________ has changed a lot in the last twenty years";

132
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:07,280
"________ is almost unrecognisable compared to twenty years ago"

133
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,680
; ________ hasn’t changed much as a place in the last twenty years."

134
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:23,760
Which of these sentences is true for your hometown? Can you add details to explain why?

135
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,240
For example:

136
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:35,460
"It’s much more ________ than it used to
be"; "The city has ________ so much"; "

137
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:42,280
The________ is a bit different nowadays."

138
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:49,280
Now, you’ve seen a lot of useful language
you can use to talk about your hometown.

139
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,960
Let’s put everything together and practice making a longer answer.

140
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,240
Part six: review.

141
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,600
Do you remember all the points we talked about?
We covered:

142
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:16,580
Introducing your hometown, adding background and details, talking about what you like or dislike about it,

143
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,520
talking about how it’s changed over time.

144
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:30,480
Follow these points and you can make a long,
detailed answer to describe your hometown.

145
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,320
For example:

146
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,560
"I live in St Petersburg.

147
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,000
It’s the second largest city in Russia,

148
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,200
and it’s a beautiful place to live.

149
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,560
I’ve lived here all my life
and I can’t imagine living anywhere else!

150
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,769
It has such a rich culture,

151
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:57,920
I think partly because the city’s history is a mix of European and Russian influences.

152
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,900
I think that’s why I like it here—it’s a unique place.

153
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:11,000
Traffic can be an issue in the city centre, but public transport is very good.

154
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,520
The city hasn’t changed much in the last twenty years,

155
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,380
although there are certainly more and more tourists these days!"

156
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,640
Could you make an answer like this?

157
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,180
Let’s do one more example first.

158
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,420
I’ll tell you about my hometown:

159
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,300
"I’m from Denver, the capital of Colorado.

160
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,300
It’s near the Rocky Mountains, so the surrounding area is quite beautiful.

161
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,160
I’ve been living here for about three years.

162
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,340
I really like Denver because it’s a young city with lots of energy,

163
