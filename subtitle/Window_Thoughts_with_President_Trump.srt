-Look at all those people
walking around down there,

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:08,675
not working.

4
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,476
It's all because of me.

5
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:12,211
You're welcome, walking people.

00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,883
Why won't they
let me build my wall?

8
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,084
All the other presidents
can do whatever they wanted.

9
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:21,321
They let JFK build his airport.

10
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,656
They let Lincoln
build his town cars.

This view is incredible.

13
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:29,262
I can see the National Mall,

14
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,598
the Washington Monument,
the Jefferson Memori--

15
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:32,732
Wait.

16
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:35,000
Why can't I see the White House?

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,169
W-Where's the White House?

[ Laughter ]

19
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,506
Oh, look.
It's some TSA agents.

20
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:41,707
And they're waving.

21
00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:43,877
And now they're holding up
one finger to say,

22
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,845
"We're number one."
How nice.

She loves me,
she loves me not.

25

She loves me,
she loves me not.

26
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,788
Oh, Nancy Pelosi,
why do you have to go

27
00:00:55,788 --> 00:00:57,323
and make things so complicated?

28
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,492
[ Laughter ]

29
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:01,361
I can't believe BuzzFeed
told everyone I lied.

30
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:02,862
I hate BuzzFeed.

31
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,931
One time, I took a quiz to find
out which Jonas Brother I was.

32
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:09,501
I was the Bonus Jonas!

Look, there's Melania.

34
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:12,805
Wonder where she's going.

35
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:14,574
And why she has so many bags.

36
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,008
And why she's running so fast.

37
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:18,645
Wait. She's escaping!
Melani-a-a-a-a!

39
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:25,084
Uh-oh. I think I might have
to call Secret Service again.

41
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,622
It's starting to rain.

42
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,123
I love the rain.

43
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:33,993
It reminds me of...Stormy.
