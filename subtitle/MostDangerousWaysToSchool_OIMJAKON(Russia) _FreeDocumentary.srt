1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,390
We all know it.

2
00:00:10,347 --> 00:00:15,347
Walked it every day, but none of them were like these.

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,763
The world's most dangerous ways to school.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,710
Climbing, freezing, paddling for hours,

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,993
all for the chance of a better life.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,080
Risky, spectacular and sometimes simply beautiful.

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,967
The world's most dangerous ways to school.

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,970
Siberia, endless vastness, arctic temperatures,

9
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,050
even further east than Japan and 5000 kilometers

10
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:12,050
North of Valdivistok lies Yakutia, Russia's coldest republic

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,150
in the midst of it Oymyakon, with 500 residents

12
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,800
it is the coldest inhabited place on earth.

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,693
The average temperature in winter minus 40 degrees Celsius.

14
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:28,723
Here everything ordinary becomes something special.

15
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,633
Also and especially the way to school.

16
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,363
A daily adventure trip in hostile temperatures.

17
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,150
The children of the Siberian Oymyakon have the world's

18
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,583
coldest way to school.

19
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,220
Six am, an ice cold morning in Oymyakon.

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,990
Irina Taric is preparing for when children get up.

21
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,050
She melts the ice from the river so her son Aljosha

22
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,073
can wash the sleep out of his eyes.

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,350
There is no running water at the coldest place on earth.

24
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,480
Temperatures can reach as low as minus 70 degrees Celsius,

25
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,270
water pipes would quite simply freeze,

26
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,740
so the residents fetch their fresh water

27
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,973
from the river in blocks of ice and then melt it for use.

28
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,170
Afterwards Irina checks the temperature as she does every

29
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,450
day, around minus 50 degrees again,

30
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,163
that means her son Aljosha must go to school.

31
00:03:08,734 --> 00:03:12,170
Aljosha is eight years old, the children of his age

32
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,580
group are only excused from attending school,

33
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,793
when the temperatures dip below minus 54 degrees.

34
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,100
Even before his departure for school,

35
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,460
Aljosha feels the grim cold, with no running water,

36
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,260
the house also has no toilet,

37
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,380
so Aljosha already has to go outside to the outhouse

38
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,213
in the garden.

39
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,903
Sometimes I wouldn't mind staying inside the house.

40
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,210
Because I'm only able to take staying outside for an hour

41
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,683
at most or maybe two.

42
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,830
His mother Irina has heated up the living room

43
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,310
to about 20 degrees, so when Aljosha opens the door

44
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,590
to the outer room and afterwards the actual front door,

45
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,730
it is essentially 70 degrees colder,

46
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,683
every day life in Oymyakon.

47
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:25,550
In Oymyakon no one spends more time than necessary

48
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,600
out in the cold, everything, that happens outside

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,020
is done very efficiently, otherwise it not only becomes

50
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,023
unpleasant, but also dangerous.

51
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,350
The little Yakut rushes back into the house

52
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,773
as fast as he can.

53
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,170
Seven kilometers away, on a remote farm,

54
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,663
Aljosha's classmate Sajana is up too.

55
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,660
The family lives form their cows,

56
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,573
before going to school, Sajana must help in the stable.

57
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,210
It's relatively warm there,

58
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,913
with temperatures around freezing.

59
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,863
In Oymyakon too they say work is the best clothing.

60
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,193
Sajana, will you please bring the bucket and the stool?

61
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,793
Mom, when I'm older I will help you milk even more cows.

62
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,130
During the severe winters,

63
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,370
the family needs every helping hand in the stable,

64
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,740
the elder siblings pitch in and help with the feeding

65
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,113
and tending of the animals.

66
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,460
The family could well imagine Sajana taking over

67
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,690
the farm one day, but in truth,

68
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,300
they've known for a long time, that school is the key

69
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,303
to their youngest daughter's dreams.

70
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:25,650
I like animals, not only cows, but also dogs and cats.

71
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,840
That's why you'd prefer to become a vet, right?

72
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,803
Oh, yes.

73
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,630
Anyone, who wants to become a vet

74
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,923
must go to school.

75
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,680
And whoever wants to go to school and lives outside

76
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,200
the village is dependent on Gregori.

77
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,070
Gregori is the driver of the school bus,

78
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,333
the only one in Oymyakon.

79
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,300
The school supplied the 58 year old with a heated garage.

80
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,790
This luxury guarantees, that the engine fluids

81
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,880
of the bus are protected from freezing

82
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,223
and that his vehicle starts in these icy temperatures.

83
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,600
Today it is very cold again, I have to check the oil

84
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,150
and the gear box every morning.

85
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,483
It's already below minus 50 degrees.

86
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,913
That's normal, so what, that's how I do it every day.

87
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,293
After all, it's for the sake of the children's lives.

88
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,210
In order for the bus to be able to drive

89
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,910
in these extreme temperatures in the first place,

90
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,220
Gregori has taken special precautions for the bus.

91
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,680
Engine failure with children

92
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,823
on board would be very dangerous.

93
00:08:27,628 --> 00:08:30,515
Therefore the 58 year old uses blankets as insulation

94
00:08:30,515 --> 00:08:33,740
for all the damageable sensitive cables

95
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,850
this is supposed to protect the bus against

96
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,309
the extreme cold during nine long winter months.

97
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,369
Gregori keeps warm by listening to the radio

98
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,963
turned up loudly, indeed, all the time.

99
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Some of the students are bugged by Gregori's loud radio,

100
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,440
but there is no way to avoid it,

101
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,860
the children living on the farms outside the village

102
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,060
are dependent on the bus driver.

103
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,623
Most households have no car of their own.

104
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,020
Back to Aljosha, after half an hour on the stove,

105
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,800
the water from the river is warm enough

106
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,000
for the daily spit bath.

107
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,600
In the Yakutian part of Siberia,

108
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
there are almost no jobs, without a school leaving

109
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,683
certificate, the chances of finding a good job are poor.

110
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,890
ALjosha's mother knows this, that's why she sends

111
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,297
her children to school.

112
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,370
Only her youngest son may stay at home today.

113
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,700
The kindergarten remains closed at temperatures

114
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,973
below minus 48 degrees Celsius.

115
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,170
On her parents farm seven kilometers away from Oymyakon,

116
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,543
Sajana's and her family's work in the stable is now done.

117
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,910
Breakfast, there's fish, eggs and warm porridge

118
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,013
made of bread, milk and sugar.

119
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,393
A warm high energy meal.

120
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,160
Sajana has older siblings, who will soon have to catch

121
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,580
the bus to school as well.

122
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,680
Hurry up with your breakfast,

123
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,823
make sure you don't miss that bus.

124
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,630
The family's farm is so remote,

125
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,557
that the school bus cannot pick up Sajana

126
00:11:04,557 --> 00:11:06,670
and her brothers directly.

127
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,313
The three of them still have to walk quite a way

128
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:12,270
through the icy cold, their mother, Shigina,

129
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,560
wraps her daughter in four different layers of clothes,

130
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,373
on top of which she wears another two jackets.

131
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,060
As well as two pairs of gloves, a cap and a thick hood.

132
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,760
Often Sajana wears so many clothes,

133
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,653
that she is unable to dress or undress by herself.

134
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,520
The student Aljosha should also make no mistake,

135
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,630
when dressing for his way to school.

136
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,970
And relies on the layering method as well.

137
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,190
Like the other children in Oymyakon,

138
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,333
the eight year old has a special outfit solely for school.

139
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,640
Over his sweater, Aljosha is wearing a shirt and a jacket.

140
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,050
He also wears six layers of clothing including the warm

141
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,563
jacket made of wool and fur.

142
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,860
His mother Irina covers every exposed inch of his skin.

143
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,083
In Oymyakon, frostbite is not uncommon.

144
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,770
Aljosha walks quickly, when he is on his way,

145
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,560
only for a short moment, a very special one

146
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,093
does he take his time.

147
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,030
He hears his nasal mucus membrane crackle,

148
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,283
as it freezes in his sinuses within split seconds.

149
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,500
The moisture immediately formed little icicles

150
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,543
on his eyelashes.

151
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,520
High time to get going on his way to school,

152
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,353
which is about one kilometer long.

153
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,083
A worried mother stays behind.

154
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,160
We only survive here, because we're used to it.

155
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,523
But below 55, 56 degrees, I don't let them leave the house.

156
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,400
Around minus 60 it's too dangerous,

157
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,843
we then don't go out at all.

158
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,450
Today it is three degrees warmer,

159
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:52,830
than Irina's limit of minus 55 degrees,

160
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,760
much to Aljosha's delight,

161
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,390
because he doesn't like the days,

162
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,860
where is not allowed out at all.

163
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,700
In spite of the cold, Aljosha really likes

164
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,733
his way to school.

165
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,560
I like my way to school, because it's on foot,

166
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,963
running is great fun.

167
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:37,020
Aljosha likes to doddle and sometimes

168
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,470
even makes a few detours despite

169
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,093
his parents strict instructions.

170
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,930
Meanwhile the school bus still struggles along the ram

171
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,483
shackle streets of Yakutia.

172
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,830
Gregori needs to pick up nearly 50 children today.

173
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,133
And take them to school.

174
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,630
Once Gregori fell I'll, more than a third

175
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,760
of the students missed class, if the bus breaks down

176
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,250
yet again, it is dangerous for everybody

177
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,663
and this happens often in the coldest place on earth.

178
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,130
If it's that cold, the oil and the petrol

179
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:27,130
can freeze, everything working on fluids can freeze.

180
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,503
Then I have to warm it up somehow.

181
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,513
Otherwise the bus won't start.

182
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,710
The streets around Oymyakon are in poor condition.

183
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,203
Every pothole can become a trap out here.

184
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,740
In the case of an engine breakdown,

185
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,240
Gregori has 30 minutes until the temperature

186
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,360
inside the car reaches the outside temperature

187
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,223
of minus 50 degrees.

188
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,720
The only bus driver far and wide is aware

189
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,900
of his special responsibility,

190
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,580
carefully he steers the bus around the largest holes.

191
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,520
Out here, broken axles are not uncommon.

192
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,340
At these temperatures, shock absorbers quickly freeze

193
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,550
and become hard and stiff, but in Yakutia,

194
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,743
a car is a new phenomenon.

195
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,510
The Siberians have always banked on their natural

196
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,080
resources, which are independent of technology,

197
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,310
which is sensitive to the cold.

198
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,120
Rain deer, this deer species is an important part

199
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,403
of life in Yakutia.

200
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,060
On the one hand, rain deer are a fat rich food.

201
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,780
On the other hand, they serve as work animals

202
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,793
pulling the sleigh.

203
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,400
And where there are no cars yet, they are also used

204
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,543
as a riding animal.

205
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,490
The domestication of the rain deer has helped

206
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,740
the Oymyakoni for centuries and the struggle

207
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,790
against the icy cold.

208
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,919
The reason for these extreme sub zero temperatures

209
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,053
lies in the unique geographical position of Yakutia.

210
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,929
Mountain ranges close the little village off

211
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,200
from the warm air streams coming from the west

212
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,930
and the south, on the other hand, the door to the arctic

213
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,633
is wide open, icy streams of air press forward unhindered.

214
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,353
In Oymyakon, winter lasts from October until April.

215
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,050
The old time record low temperature, minus 71 degrees

216
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:54,040
Celsius, recorded in 2013 by the local meteorologist.

217
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,980
During the summer months in June, July,

218
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,150
on the other hand it might even get as hot

219
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,480
as 30 degrees, the villagers, however,

220
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,563
take rather more pride in low temperature records.

221
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,490
To go to school in these ice cold temperatures

222
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,710
is daily routine for the children in Oymyakon,

223
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,923
it's high time for Sajana to get going.

224
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,540
SAjana's siblings always join her, her parents forbid her

225
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,900
to walk this way alone, their fear of her freezing to death

226
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,173
on her way is too great.

227
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,470
For us this cold has become normal by now,

228
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,963
I too had to go to school under these conditions.

229
00:18:56,111 --> 00:19:00,367
Sajana is still very young, but considering her age,

230
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:04,223
she knows quite well how to deal with the cold.

231
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,573
And the older ones help the younger ones.

232
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,803
That reassures me a bit.

233
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,940
Like nearly all children, Sajana goes marching

234
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,993
to school, but it's not solely due to the cold.

235
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,010
Under no circumstances may she miss the bus.

236
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:30,930
It would in fact be better to be there a few minutes early,

237
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,563
because the bus only comes once and does not wait.

238
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,530
Without taking to look at them, the three of them

239
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,750
meet creatures, which only exit here

240
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,363
above the arctic circle, wild horses.

241
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:56,110
With especially thick skin, they run free

242
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:59,343
and can cope with temperatures down to minus 70 degrees.

243
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,230
Unlike the rain deer, horses are not work animals

244
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,300
in Oymyakon and it wouldn't occur to anyone to ride them,

245
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,810
horse meat is a delicacy here and exercise would make

246
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:17,913
the meat tough.

247
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:29,090
By now the bus has done more than half of its tour.

248
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,640
Several children have been picked up and it's three

249
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,603
more kilometers to Sajana's home.

250
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,163
But then Gregori is in trouble.

251
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,413
Something's wrong.

252
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,933
One of the rear wheels won't turn anymore.

253
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,763
That happens quite often I'm afraid,

254
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,100
these are old tires, they spin, this definitely

255
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,600
wouldn't happen with new ones.

256
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,680
If the bus gets stuck out here,

257
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,590
there is a serious problem, Oymyakon is four kilometers

258
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,700
away, nobody will come to their aid.

259
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,590
Gregori must fix the bus by himself,

260
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,763
otherwise it may quickly become dangerous.

261
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,150
Just last week someone wanted to drive

262
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:53,850
to the neighboring village Tomtur.

263
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,770
His fuel indicator was inaccurate,

264
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,283
he hadn't checked it, his car ran out of fuel out here.

265
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,350
Had he not got as far as here, he might have been able

266
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,773
to walk back, well, he died.

267
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,940
Sajana isn't aware of any of this.

268
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,790
With hurried steps, she trudges to the meeting point

269
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,713
through the snow.

270
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,490
Sajana doesn't know, that the bus had a breakdown.

271
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,110
She might've just as easily have missed it.

272
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,260
The only thing she can do is hope and wait

273
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,303
for the school bus at minus 52 degrees.

274
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,920
I hope the bus is still coming or I won't be able

275
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,103
to go to school.

276
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,390
A few minutes, the eight year old

277
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:01,380
can afford to wait in the cold,

278
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,830
then she must quickly return home.

279
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,490
Her destination, the school is seven kilometers away

280
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,640
on the northern edge of the forest,

281
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,873
the pride and joy of the town of 500 residents.

282
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,833
Here, 25 teachers educate 118 students.

283
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,310
The school principle Katarina Yuvkovia

284
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,270
lives across the street.

285
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,300
At a quarter to eight, she is the first

286
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,400
to enter the building.

287
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,550
This is the only school here, for the children

288
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,630
living in this area it is the only chance

289
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,983
to receive an education.

290
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,040
The school with its 25 classrooms

291
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,630
is the largest building in Oymyakon,

292
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,923
therefore it is also the most difficult to keep warm.

293
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,340
We have central district heating here,

294
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:03,563
which only heats this school and a few more private houses.

295
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,700
a small coal fired power plant

296
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,170
heats six buildings via district heating round the clock

297
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:14,163
with the help of 20 tons of brown coal per year.

298
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,310
All the houses in Oymyakon are built of wood,

299
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:26,210
like the school, any other material would burst

300
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,830
with the differences in temperature of over 100 degrees

301
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,533
between winter and summer.

302
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,610
The structure of the houses is similar everywhere,

303
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,090
an unheated outer room serves as a lock and store room.

304
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,540
Then comes the heating room, the fireplace,

305
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,590
followed by a room, which is used as a living

306
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,393
and dining room, and behind that lie the bedrooms.

307
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,427
In order for the house to remain warm,

308
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:54,370
the Oymyakons fill up every gap however small

309
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:58,330
with poly urethane foam, but the cold comes in

310
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,090
at some point anyway, always.

311
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,340
Aljosha's father has to heat the house nine months

312
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,993
nonstop in order to keep it warm somehow.

313
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:17,410
My parents, my grandparents and my great great

314
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,963
grandparents have lived here.

315
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,410
And so we live here too, I like living

316
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,783
in harmony with nature.

317
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,810
In order to live in harmony with the extreme

318
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,970
cold, one has to constantly be on the alert,

319
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:42,853
even when performing very ordinary tasks.

320
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,580
Irina cannot let the freshly washed laundry

321
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,670
dry in the house, the risk is too great,

322
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,880
that the moisture will cause

323
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,723
the beams of the house to split.

324
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,730
At the coldest place on earth, the laundry always dries

325
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:00,623
in the garden.

326
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,087
Within seconds, the water is frozen

327
00:26:11,087 --> 00:26:13,990
and the laundry as stiff as a board.

328
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,130
At least the wash is free of germs,

329
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,043
the low temperatures immediately kill any germs.

330
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,610
But Aljosha's father is also aware of many disadvantages

331
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:26,483
of the cold, especially when people get careless.

332
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,850
Many people here drink and it's happened often,

333
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:33,593
that they fall asleep in the snow.

334
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,520
They don't notice, that they're freezing to death,

335
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,720
already at temperatures around minus 20,

336
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,743
the extremities start to die off.

337
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,220
A few years ago a friend of his froze to death

338
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,670
in the middle of the village.

339
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,430
One's worries become even greater,

340
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,820
if your eight year old happens to be a cheeky kid,

341
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,770
in spite of the icy temperatures,

342
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,090
he is full of nonsense, just as any other child

343
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,093
his age would be.

344
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,240
He especially likes to scare the cattle on their way

345
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,140
to the water hall.

346
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,530
He takes no notice of the special clothes

347
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,513
the thick skinned cows are wearing.

348
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,700
As a shield against the cold,

349
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,260
their owner has strapped a sort of special bra

350
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,250
around their udders, a braw made of nylon stockings

351
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,060
protects the most sensitive parts of their bodies

352
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,083
from frostbite.

353
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,220
Sajana has been waiting for more than 15 minutes already,

354
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,010
but still no bus in sight, if it doesn't arrive soon,

355
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,460
she will have to return home.

356
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,338
400 meters away, north of the clearing,

357
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:11,783
Sajana's father performs his daily duties.

358
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,490
The firewood doesn't have to dry after it's been chopped.

359
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,380
Due to the icy cold, it is become so brittle,

360
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,173
one blow is enough to break it.

361
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:28,450
And Sajana's father needs a lot of wood,

362
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:30,650
more than 60 cubic meters is burned

363
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,660
by each inhabitant on average every winter,

364
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,083
that adds up to five truck loads.

365
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,710
We live here and work here, without the work

366
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,710
one cannot survive and whoever doesn't work dies.

367
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,720
Of course it's cold, life can be tough here sometimes,

368
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,620
but then you just have to work harder.

369
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,870
Sometimes we work for sheer survival,

370
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,127
what more can I say?

371
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,570
If it's extremely cold, I simply cannot allow my children

372
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:25,710
to run around outside, then they have to stay inside,

373
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,933
play computer games or watch TV.

374
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,590
The only way they're allowed to walk

375
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,113
is their way to school anyway.

376
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,520
For Sajana's parents, moving away

377
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,793
from Oymyakon is out of the question.

378
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,850
They decided a long time ago to live in the coldest place

379
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:47,380
on earth, but Sajana should make her own decision

380
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,240
and that is only possible, if she goes to school

381
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,223
and graduates.

382
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,330
Like many other parents in Oymyakon,

383
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,493
they put Gregori in charge of that.

384
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:19,170
As so often, the bus driver uses all available means

385
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:22,513
to get his bus going again and to escape from the cold.

386
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,830
Giving it a lot of gas and a little bit of luck

387
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,733
he manages.

388
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,860
But now it's shortly before eight o clock, the break down

389
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,680
cost him almost a quarter of an hour.

390
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,300
It is quite possible, that many children

391
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,053
won't be waiting at the agreed meeting points anymore.

392
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,920
But Sajana has held out, just in time Gregor picks up

393
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,443
the freezing eight year old.

394
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,420
The school bus, on the hand it's the only way

395
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:14,593
to get to school, on the other, an unpopular necessity.

396
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,470
The school bus is the worst thing, it's always loud,

397
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,693
dirty and too hot in there.

398
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:41,410
Aljosha has been on his way for half an hour

399
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,690
already, even though he can make it to school

400
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,740
in a good 20 minutes.

401
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,460
But the lure to take the detour across the frozen river

402
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,440
in the morning was too great,

403
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,643
now the nine year old is freezing.

404
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,800
Within a short time, the bitter cold always finds its way

405
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,053
through all six layers of clothes.

406
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,350
The ice beneath Aljosha's feet is up to four meters

407
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,340
thick in some places, in winter, cars and Gregori's school

408
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,353
bus use the river as a short cut.

409
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,780
For the boy, the river bed is always a place

410
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:48,680
to discover new things, because the Indigieka,

411
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,720
that's what the Oymyakons call the river,

412
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,503
although frozen is still alive.

413
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,420
Four times a year, a truck from Yakuck,

414
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,420
which is 700 kilometers away delivers canned

415
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,973
and vacuum packed food.

416
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,450
Apart from this, the residents of Oymyakon

417
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,883
live self sufficiently.

418
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,510
In every season of the year, the river provides

419
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,723
stable food, such as fish.

420
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,700
In winter time, the river Indigieka is the hunting ground

421
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,710
for ice anglers, using their fishing rods and nets,

422
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,663
they provide the basic food supply of the whole village.

423
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,903
They wait for hours with their nets.

424
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,110
Then they grab the fish out of the nets

425
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,323
with their bare hands.

426
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,360
The water, which is zero degrees doesn't bother them,

427
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,960
what does bother them, though is the air temperature

428
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,763
of minus 50 degrees.

429
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,440
The ice fisherman don't have to kill the fish,

430
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,823
within seconds, the animals are shock frozen.

431
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:53,599
The ice fisherman probably have the coldest job here

432
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,030
in Oymyakon, that's not for Aljosha.

433
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,333
One day he wants to create something and see the world.

434
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:08,340
I'd like nothing better than to become and architect,

435
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,173
build houses.

436
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,823
That's why I attend school.

437
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:20,530
Whenever he doesn't feel like going to school

438
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:23,330
and taking on the icy way to get there,

439
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:24,763
Aljosha remembers his dream,

440
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:30,163
the last few meters and he's made it, he is at school.

441
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,820
Frozen stiff he reached the school building

442
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,023
at a quarter past eight.

443
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,580
Aljosha is a bit early, but there are already many

444
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,060
children there, all those children, who arrive on foot

445
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,370
arrange enough time to thaw after their way to school.

446
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,323
The best way is to play around.

447
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:16,330
ALjosha's teacher prepares for her class.

448
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,200
Half of the seats are still vacant,

449
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,840
but in the coldest place on earth,

450
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,823
nobody is able to skip class.

451
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,790
If it's that cold outside, the parents

452
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:30,150
may decide for themselves whether they send

453
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,193
their children to school or not.

454
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,450
But if the children don't turn up

455
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,280
without informing the school

456
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,150
and having an excuse, we must definitely call

457
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,623
and ask what has happened.

458
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,610
The risk of a child freezing to death

459
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,313
on his or her way to school is too high.

460
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,360
By now the bus is full to bursting point.

461
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,293
It's loud, stuffy, but at least it's not cold.

462
00:37:32,423 --> 00:37:34,480
After the more than two hour drive,

463
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,903
Gregori finally drives the crammed bus up to school.

464
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,630
Sajana is happy to have arrived

465
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,893
and Gregori can take a break until school ends at two pm.

466
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:53,750
It's exactly half past eight, Sajana arrives

467
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,200
in the nick of time with the school bell ringing.

468
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:08,220
Today all children are more or less punctual

469
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,673
and lessons start.

470
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,710
Five hours lie ahead of the children,

471
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:19,243
math, biology, history and Russian.

472
00:38:20,462 --> 00:38:22,870
Aljosha and Sajana are Yakuts,

473
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,830
they're language is based on their Turkish

474
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:26,253
and Mongolian roots.

475
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,210
The Yakutian language has little to do with Russian

476
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:32,050
and so the children have to learn Russian

477
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:35,160
almost as a foreign language, at least if they want

478
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,760
to leave this forbidden place at some point in time.

479
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:47,640
Sajana stands a fair chance, she is a straight A student

480
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,223
and top of her class.

481
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:56,313
Aljosha is talented, but not very hard working.

482
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,763
My favorite classes are history and math.

483
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:15,043
But to be honest, I come here to play and paint

484
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
and meet my friends.

485
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,450
After the first two lessons,

486
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,900
it's time for the main break.

487
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,170
The students storm into the cafeteria.

488
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:32,850
In cold Siberia there is traditionally a second breakfast

489
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:33,700
for the children.

490
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,683
Warm noodles and hot tea,

491
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,913
essential for the increased energy needs.

492
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,470
Afterwards they all stay in the building,

493
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,570
no one wants to go out in the school yard,

494
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,460
for this, the children would first of all

495
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,790
need to put various layers of clothing,

496
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:06,570
that's too cumbersome, takes too long

497
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,623
and it's simply too damn cold outside.

498
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,400
The play equipment in the yard is used

499
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,840
only during three months of the year,

500
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,100
however, they are designed in such a way,

501
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,523
that they can withstand even the coldest winter on earth.

502
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,520
If no one comes to the garden,

503
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,793
the garden must go to the students.

504
00:41:01,201 --> 00:41:04,913
A few green plants provide for a little wellness oasis.

505
00:41:10,427 --> 00:41:12,820
Apart from that, the students pass the time playing

506
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:17,790
board games, the school rifle is also very popular

507
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,623
with the boys.

508
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,800
The children learn how to disassemble a real gun

509
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,350
and put it back together again.

510
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,470
The quicker they learn how to do this,

511
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:35,950
the earlier their fathers will take them hunting.

512
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,880
Since the children can't really let off steam

513
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,392
inside the building, there are gym exercises

514
00:41:54,392 --> 00:41:56,242
at the beginning of the third lesson.

515
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:09,130
Sajana and Aljosha are in Russian class right now.

516
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,380
This time the students were asked to learn

517
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,843
a whole poem by heart.

518
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,633
Sajana worked hard and knows all the verses perfectly.

519
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:44,835
School ends at two pm, while the children from nearby

520
00:42:44,835 --> 00:42:48,490
start off on their cold foot walk back home,

521
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:50,877
the school bus children wait for Gregori

522
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:54,020
and his ram shackled bus in the school building,

523
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,270
where it's nice and warm.

524
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:05,030
Often the students can hear him before they see him,

525
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,123
quite simply because of the loud music.

526
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,183
Afterwards, all of them just want to get into the warm bus.

527
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:33,250
Aljosha enjoys the first part of the way walking

528
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,083
with a friend.

529
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:44,260
Then he's on his own again, despite the extreme cold,

530
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,950
his desire to move about is not in the least bit exhausted.

531
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:51,540
Aljosha does what all children of the world do

532
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,593
on their way home, he makes up his own games.

533
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,663
Again, the eight year old doddles on his way,

534
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:19,570
but mom and dad know their son and also know

535
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,220
when they have to start worrying.

536
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,803
Now he's fully warmed up,

537
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,790
he won't be coming home that quickly now.

538
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:51,117
But he's well wrapped up, he wants stay outside and play,

539
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,903
but his games never last very long.

540
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,500
Nevertheless, ALjosha's father

541
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,200
always feels a bit of relief,

542
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,883
when he sees his son come in through the garden gate.

543
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:21,270
Sajana made it through the drive back with Gregori's

544
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,320
school bus, before doing her homework,

545
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,530
she helps her mother in the kitchen,

546
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:30,420
the two are very close, spend a lot of time together.

547
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,280
No wonder, friends from school rarely come over

548
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,963
to play at the farm, because they must take the bus.

549
00:45:37,993 --> 00:45:39,603
And have to stay the night.

550
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:14,370
Aljosha and his brothers turn the living room

551
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:17,500
into a playground, the three of them have a great

552
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,943
time together, their favorite game is playing bus or car.

553
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:29,230
I prefer summer.

554
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,063
Then I could play outside longer.

555
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,590
Sajana's siblings are too old to be playing

556
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:48,390
with her, most of the time she spends with her homework

557
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:49,523
or coloring books.

558
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,160
There's not much else to do for her in the coldest

559
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,353
place on earth.

560
00:46:58,930 --> 00:47:01,410
At school there are many children,

561
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:05,663
at home it is so boring, at school it's different.

562
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,610
And my siblings are always just sitting

563
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:18,143
in front of their computers.

564
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,440
At seven pm it's time for eight year old

565
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,280
Aljosha to go to bed, the next day the thermometer

566
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,863
will decide whether he must get up early again,

567
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,630
whether they will once again have to set out

568
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,413
on one of the most dangerous ways to school on earth.
