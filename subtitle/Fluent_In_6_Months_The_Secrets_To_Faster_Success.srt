possible can you do it can you speak

18
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:08,020
English fluently powerfully in six

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,710
months six months from today and the

20
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,180
answer is yes yes you can absolutely yes

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,930
you can let's talk about what this means

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,689
to be fluent and how to do it first

23
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,220
let's just talk about this word fluid

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,979
fluent in six months fluent what does

25
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:34,720
this word fluent mean fluent well fluent

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,490
has the same root as the word fluid

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,340
fluid means flowing or moving like water

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,860
okay water like movement right so if you

29
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,020
think of water think of a river or a

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,710
stream how does it move right it it kind

31
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,829
of it moves effortlessly that's why I

32
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:59,289
use the name effortless English water

33
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,610
moves effortlessly and smoothly right

34
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,689
that's how water flows or moves so

35
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,350
fluent or fluency we're talking about a

36
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,470
son

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,190
buthe movement now if we're talking

38
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,750
about English what are we talking about

39
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,920
it's the smooth movement of words of

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,070
phrases of sentences of the language it

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,340
means you speak in a way that's fairly

42
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,020
effortless and smooth the opposite of

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:40,610
fluent would be to speak like speak like

44
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,230
this and right that's the opposite of

45
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,959
fluid it means it's the words are not

46
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,600
coming out smoothly they're not coming

47
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,030
out easily they're not coming out

48
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,390
naturally right that's not fluent so

49
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,720
just we're talking specifically about

50
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,940
speaking when we say fluent or fluency

51
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,980
which I'm not speaking and how the words

52
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,410
come out that's the meaning of fluency

53
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,530
that is the real meaning of fluency so

54
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,680
flowing like water I often try to use

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,989
the phrase powerful powerfully speak

56
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,420
powerfully so again you're confident

57
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,430
when you speak the words come out fairly

58
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,000
easily they flow out this does not mean

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,769
let's talk about what fluency does not

60
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,200
mean it does not mean perfection right

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,930
if you're fluent you're conversationally

62
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,150
fluent it means you're fluent when you

63
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,340
have a normal conversation you're not

64
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,170
perfect you're not perfect you will make

65
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,930
mistakes you'll mix grammar mistakes you

66
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,680
might make some pronunciation mistakes

67
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,690
hey I make mistakes sometimes still so

68
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,370
you're gonna make mistakes it's not

69
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,060
perfection

70
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,209
number two fluency does not mean like a

71
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,470
native speaker okay so when you speak

72
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,510
fluently it does not mean you speak at

73
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,120
the same level as I do I learned English

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,820
as from when I was a baby so it does not

75
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,920
mean like a native speaker that's a much

76
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,769
higher level of English speaking that's

77
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,680
very very advanced okay you don't need

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,320
that advanced level to speak fluently

79
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,329
for your words to come out easily for

80
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,048
you to communicate effectively a fluency

81
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:24,260
is sort of the first level communicating

82
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,520
effectively powerfully the words

83
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:33,000
fairly easily what else do you need a

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,190
huge amount of vocabulary to speak

85
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,810
fluently no you don't because again

86
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,610
we're talking about conversational

87
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,759
fluency so when you are fluent then

88
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,860
you're conversationally fluent what does

89
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,840
it mean it means you speak and

90
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
communicate fairly easily effectively

91
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,699
powerfully in normal conversations

92
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,300
normal everyday conversations normal

93
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,509
everyday topics so not talking about

94
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,150
special topics like economics or

95
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,090
business or something from you know

96
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,050
school no everyday you know talking

97
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,460
about the weather talking about your

98
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,780
feelings how you feel

99
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,240
talking about what you did today or

100
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,039
yesterday or what you're going to do

101
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,000
tomorrow you buying a train ticket yep

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,199
going shopping those everyday normal

103
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,759
conversations that we have for that you

104
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,270
only need about 3,000 words of

105
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,110
vocabulary

106
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,569
some people say less some people say a

107
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,219
little more I'll just give you the

108
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:37,620
average look around 3,000 words that's

109
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,650
not a huge amount it's not small it's

110
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,979
not tiny but it's not huge so if you can

111
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,529
use 3,000 words

112
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:50,219
fairly easily in natural phrases you're

113
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:52,440
fluent you're conversationally fluent

114
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,509
are you finished with English at that

115
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:55,919
point no you're not you still have a

116
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,690
long way to go if you want to be like a

117
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,940
native speaker close to a native but you

118
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,810
can certainly be fluent in six months so

119
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,389
what it means is you speak powerfully

120
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,569
naturally smooth fairly smoothly with

121
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,250
mistakes you will definitely be making

122
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,529
mistakes still after six months don't

123
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:14,330
worry about it

124
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,520
as long as people understand you as long

125
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,960
as you're communicating well you're

126
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,020
fluent let's talk about the next part of

127
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,900
this fluent in six months six months

128
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,159
what do we mean by that six months well

129
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,919
honestly if we talk about six months

130
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,719
it's not talking about months is not

131
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:35,909
really the best way to talk about time

132
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,070
for your goal of speaking English in six

133
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,810
months

134
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:41,240
as you can imagine imagine we have two

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,450
students one student only listens to

136
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,850
English one hour per week and the other

137
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,010
one listens to English ten hours per day

138
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,360
after six months there's going to be a

139
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,690
huge difference between these two if

140
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,180
someone only does one hour per week they

141
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,490
will not be fluent in six months it's

142
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,230
not enough time really we should talk

143
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,660
about hours rather than days or weeks or

144
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,970
months or years it's the hours it's a

145
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,520
number of hours you spend learning

146
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,410
English that's important so when we're

147
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:13,910
talking about getting fluent in six

148
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,190
months there are two important things

149
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,669
there's quantity it means the amount the

150
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:22,520
amount of hours especially and there's

151
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,540
quality quality it's how you use those

152
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,169
hours every day because how you learn is

153
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,750
also very very important you could spend

154
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,900
five hours a day learning English but do

155
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,210
it in a way that's not effective low

156
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,639
quality so you need both quantity and

157
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,020
quality to achieve this goal let's first

158
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,479
talk about the quantity how many hours

159
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,510
do you need how many hours do you need

160
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,550
to become fluent conversationally fluent

161
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,140
well it's different for every person I

162
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,000
can't give you an exact number I'll give

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,440
you a very general number let's say

164
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,700
about 700 hours about 700 hours of

165
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,380
quality effective English learning study

166
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,030
practice training about 700 hours now

167
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,979
for some people it will be more might be

168
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:17,780
a thousand and for some one might be

169
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,340
less so we'll just say as a general

170
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:27,650
average guess about 700 hours now here's

171
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,720
some good news you already have some

172
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,940
hours right you probably learn English

173
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,530
in school for many years

174
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,450
that was low quality a lot of those

175
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,299
hours were not very good but still it's

176
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:40,458
better than nothing okay if you learn

177
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,250
English for five years in school you at

178
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,990
least learn some vocabulary through

179
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,600
memorization maybe you can't use it very

180
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,790
effectively maybe your head is filled

181
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,380
with grammar and you're confused you're

182
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,430
not fluent yet

183
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,250
but it's still better than zero so you

184
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,940
still have some hours already that's

185
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,800
good news that will help you it means

186
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,870
you don't quite need seven hundred maybe

187
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,160
you only need five hundred to get

188
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,800
fluency which is great good news for you

189
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,060
the other part of this that's quantity

190
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,889
that's the amount of hours you need in

191
00:09:12,889 --> 00:09:16,639
six months the next part is quality it's

192
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,709
how you do it is very important as I

193
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:22,189
said in school low low low quality you

194
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,500
might learn English in school for a

195
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,009
thousand hours but the problem is your

196
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:29,839
memorizing lists of vocabulary that you

197
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,290
quickly forget you're memorizing long

198
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,689
lists of grammar that you can't use when

199
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,319
you speak too complicated you forget

200
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:41,240
you're taking tasks you're stressed

201
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,759
you're bored a lot of time in class

202
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,709
you're not you're not really focused

203
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:46,879
you're kind of bored when you're doing

204
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,769
your homework you're bored you're half

205
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:52,069
asleep so you might have a thousand

206
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,420
hours in school but it does not really

207
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,480
equal a thousand quality hours and maybe

208
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,399
it only equals about a hundred hours

209
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,160
really because it's so low quality so

210
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,800
you want to get the highest quality from

211
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,649
every minute from every hour that you

212
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,420
learn English that is what the

213
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,110
effortless English system does so what

214
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,449
do I mean by quality number one power

215
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:17,089
right it is this a powerful way to learn

216
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,519
it means you are focused you are focused

217
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,550
and concentrating every minute so if

218
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,319
you're listening to English but you're

219
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,029
kind of falling asleep you're sitting at

220
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,370
your desk that's low quality that's no

221
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,040
good you're wasting a lot of your time

222
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,810
you need to be a your brain needs to be

223
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,699
awake you need to be focused you need to

224
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,410
be listening carefully to every word

225
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,279
every phrase that's the highest quality

226
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,620
alert awake maximum concentration it

227
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,300
needs to be understandable this is

228
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,430
something else for quality English

229
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,439
learning you must understand it if you

230
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:53,240
don't understand it you're wasting your

231
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,160
time so this is the problem if your

232
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,800
lower level and you listen to a movie or

233
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,889
a TV show you're wasting your time it's

234
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,439
too advanced you

235
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,979
understand anything so most of your time

236
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:12,220
is completely wasted you watching out 2

237
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,160
hours or an hour of TV but really you're

238
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,829
getting almost no quality English

239
00:11:17,829 --> 00:11:20,349
learning so you must understand it it

240
00:11:20,349 --> 00:11:22,359
can be a little difficult but not do

241
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:25,139
difficult very very important

242
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,579
understandable is super important that's

243
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:32,589
part of quality next you need to have

244
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,489
some emotion positive even negative

245
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:38,949
sometimes but especially strong positive

246
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:42,249
emotions will help you learn much faster

247
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:44,379
that's also part of quality it's why I

248
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:48,689
use stories a lot in effortless English

249
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:51,220
just think about it when you learn

250
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,409
something with no emotion just gonna

251
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:56,949
flat it's much more easy to forget but

252
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,259
if you learn something with excitement

253
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:02,799
or energy or passion or sometimes even

254
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,639
fear or humor laughter you are more

255
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,399
likely to remember it and to remember it

256
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,269
a long time so it needs to be emotional

257
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:17,589
and energetic emotion and energy go

258
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:18,359
together

259
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:21,850
so again a low energy low quality way to

260
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,720
study English is to sit at your desk

261
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,069
listening or just reading a textbook

262
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:30,549
right as low energy your mind starts to

263
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,019
go to sleep you're wasting a lot of your

264
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,699
time but if you're up if you're moving

265
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,069
if your your hearts you know leading you

266
00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:37,269
got energy going through your body

267
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,129
you're feeling good you're smiling

268
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:41,129
you're awake your brain wakes up

269
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,149
everything is much more effective

270
00:12:43,149 --> 00:12:44,799
everything you do you will remember

271
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,350
better you will learn faster this is so

272
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,209
important you need the highest quality

273
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:54,159
time to achieve this goal I'll give you

274
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,779
a quick example of this let's say you're

275
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,899
trying to learn the verb to cuddle to

276
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:01,539
cuddle that's a nice little word to

277
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:04,299
cuddle now you could the low quality way

278
00:13:04,299 --> 00:13:06,609
the school way the normal way to learn

279
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:08,649
to cuddle would be to look in the

280
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:12,069
dictionary for the verb to cuddle and to

281
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:13,689
write down the meaning and then to

282
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:15,339
memorize it the title the cuddle Dakota

283
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:18,339
little is repeated a lot right is it's

284
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:18,910
good more

285
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,410
so it's probably gonna be low energy

286
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,960
there's no emotion you're trying to

287
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,880
memorize it and then you probably have a

288
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,380
list of a lot more words you're also

289
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,810
trying to memorize so when you get to

290
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,250
the end of the list you've forgotten the

291
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,660
first one you forgot cuddle and then you

292
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,340
got to go back and try it again again

293
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,930
and again and again and again it's

294
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,970
boring it's ineffective you waste a lot

295
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,280
of time what does it mean by the way to

296
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,110
cuddle the cuddle means to be like

297
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,220
affectionate like to hug and kind of rub

298
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,310
with someone it has a romantic idea okay

299
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,720
so you can it's not really sexual okay

300
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,370
but it can be if you have a girlfriend

301
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,560
boyfriend they like to cuddle right

302
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,420
they're always touching and hugging and

303
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,150
rubbing against each other oh but you

304
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,800
can also do it you know children like to

305
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,420
cuddle so if you have a child you can

306
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,400
cuddle and hug them and oh it feels so

307
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,930
good or even with a dog a puppy right a

308
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,430
puppy you can play it on you hug them in

309
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,520
oh yeah maybe it's not like super

310
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,080
romantic kissing but you know kiss them

311
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,670
on the head and again it's more of this

312
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,560
action of rubbing and holding and

313
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,980
hugging to cuddle so you've got the one

314
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,420
way the old way to learn it you just

315
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,370
have try to memorize it to hug

316
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,760
affectionately imagine a different way

317
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,410
of learning this word imagine that a

318
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:37,120
super sexy hot guy or girl whichever you

319
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,250

326
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,820
each other and holding each other hmm

327
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,680
and there and again they're whispering

328
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,050
the word in your ear oh it feels so good

329
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,960

be beating super powerful emotion

333
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,360
there's also physical feelings happening

334
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,600
at the same time which one is more

335
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,270
memorable are you going to remember

336
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,780
studying it from the dictionary

337
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,120
definition trying to memorize the old

338
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,790
way the normal school way or are you

339
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,400
gonna remember this super

340
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,640
emotional experience of this hot guy or

341
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,010
girl cuddling with you and saying the

342
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,680
word in your ear

343
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,650
obviously cuddling with the guy or the

344
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,440
girl it will be much more memorable I

345
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,600
guarantee you will never forget that

346
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
word again this will become one of your

347
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,270
favorite words you'll know you'll you'll

348
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,190
learn it instantly and you'll never

349
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:56,880
forget it that's an example an extreme

350
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,840
example of the highest quality of

351
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,210
learning in this case vocabulary right

352
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,600
because it's got the maximum amount of

353
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,540
emotion

354
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,670
now of course normally day to day it's

355
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,730
hard to achieve that super high level of

356
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,060
emotion I wish we could it's hard to but

357
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,490
still we can get much more emotion if we

358
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,830
learn vocabulary and learn phrases and

359
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,820
even grammar using stories using

360
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,500
physical movement all the things we do

361
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,320
in effortless English or design to bring

362
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,360
the emotion higher bring the energy

363
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,100
higher so that you remember everything

364
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,720
much faster and longer that's how we get

365
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,120
faster more powerful results because the

366
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,360
quality is so much higher with

367
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,980
effortless English let's talk about

368
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,930
another example I want you to train like

369
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,800
a champion

370
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,160
imagine that English instead of like a

371
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,420
subject you study in school more instead

372
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,640
imagine it's more like a sport it's an

373
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,470
activity that you're training for like

374
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:06,990
you would for a sport right to be a

375
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,359
champion you're going to be a champion

376
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,230
English speaker you are a champion

377
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,829
English speaker

378
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,730
how would you train like a champion I do

379
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,829
do Jitsu Brazilian jiu-jitsu that's why

380
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:23,130
it's my hobby so let's imagine a

381
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,260
jiu-jitsu - jiu-jitsu fighters -

382
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,830
jiu-jitsu students ok what is just a

383
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,040
normal person like me like like most

384
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,650
people who learn jujitsu and the other

385
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,230
one is Andre Galvao who is a world

386
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,240
champion let's look at the difference in

387
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,820
quality how they train and quant

388
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,400
how do they train jiu-jitsu and how do

389
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,050
they get results what are the results

390
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,640
how are they different what's different

391
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,850
about a champion and a normal person

392
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,290
because again I want you to be a

393
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,350
champion in English not just a normal

394
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,910
school learner a normal person for

395
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,940
jiu-jitsu mmm usually goes to class two

396
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,730
or three times per week two or three

397
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,290
times a week is the kind of normal

398
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,720
average jiu-jitsu learner now that's

399
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,870
what I do most of the people I know

400
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,450
train two to three times per week

401
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,080
what does Andre Galvao do world champion

402
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,940
he trains twice per day maybe more two

403
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,420
times per day that's fourteen times per

404
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,690
week instead of two or three

405
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,560
so his quantity his amount is much much

406
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,640
higher I guess what it's also much more

407
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,150
quality the other thing when a normal

408
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,360
person learns a new technique in

409
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,200
jiu-jitsu they practice that technique

410
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,730
maybe ten times

411
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,790
maybe twenty times I'd say at the most

412
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,780
probably fifty times how many times does

413
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,910
Andre Galvao practice a new technique

414
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,440
that he's working on a thousand times or

415
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,030
more he practises each new technique

416
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,000
1,000 times or more the amount of

417
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,640
repetition that a champion gets in their

418
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,010
practice in their training is much much

419
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,720
higher again so much higher quantity

420
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,820
repetitions it's the amount of time the

421
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,500
number of hours per day and also the

422
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,750
amount of repetition that they get is so

423
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,500
much higher for a champion and then the

424
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,060
quality what about the quality the

425
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,870
amount of focus so for a normal digital

426
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,240
learner they think of it as kind of a

427
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,740
hobby that's how I think if you Jitsu

428
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,290
it's a hobby so I go and I try to pay

429
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,900
attention I'm focused of course and I'm

430
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,080
awake when I'm there I'm enjoying myself

431
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,270
but Andre got our or another champion is

432
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,880
much much higher than that they are toad

433
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,260
focused right they are super high-energy

434
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,170
they are serious they are concentrating

435
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:04,740
every minute they are learning every

436
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,440
minute they're training the intensity

437
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,520
the emotion is super high they're also

438
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,340
consistent normal people who are

439
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,290
learning something like jiu-jitsu or any

440
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,620
sport as a hobby yeah you know some days

441
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,410
you feel good and you try really hard

442
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,910
and some days maybe you're a little

443
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,130
tired a little lazy you don't try your

444
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,410
best and it's kind of up and down day to

445
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,250
day it's different

446
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,770
a champion like on during about every

447
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,590
moment every day every training it's a

448
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,170
hundred percent effort all the time a

449
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,110
hundred percent energy all the time a

450
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:42,870
hundred percent passion and emotion all

451
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,310
the time every minute every hour every

452
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,060
week every month of training the

453
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:55,560
emotional quality the energy is so much

454
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,120
higher than just regular normal people

455
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,490
and of course what's the result under go

456
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,910
bow super fast improvement world

457
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,700
champion normal people still improving

458
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,430
the slow slow improvement hey I'm

459
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,050
getting a little better at Jiu Jitsu but

460
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,060
it's very slow most people you know they

461
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,250
improve but slowly nothing like a

462
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,380
champion normal people will never become

463
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,470
world champions we can learn from this

464
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,940
example because we see this in all

465
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,910
sports in all different skill areas this

466
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,530
same idea of quantity and quality that's

467
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,140
what determines the amount of success

468
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,540
you have how powerful your results are

469
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,520
and how fast your improvement is so you

470
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,100
I want you to be a powerful champion I

471
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,320
