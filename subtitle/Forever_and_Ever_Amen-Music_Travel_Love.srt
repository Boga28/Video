1
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,880
You may think that I'm talking foolish

2
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,840
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,240
You may wonder how I can promise you now

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,820
This love that I feel for you always will be

5
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,200
But you're not just time that I'm killin'

6
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,780
I'm no longer one of those guys

7
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:00,540
As sure as I live, O..  this love that I give

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,700
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die

9
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,020
Oh, baby, I'm gonna love you forever

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,540
Forever and ever, amen

11
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,540
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather

12
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,620
As long as old women sit and talk about old men

13
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:35,080
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful

14
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,920
I'll be happy to tell you again

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,380
Ooo Darling... I'm gonna love you forever and ever

16
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,160
Forever and ever, amen

17
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,800
They say time take its toll on a body

18
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,180
Makes a young men's brown hair turn gray

19
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,060
Well, honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair

20
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,280
And if it all fell out, O.. I'd love you anyway

21
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,860
Ooo... They say time takes its toll on a mem'ry

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,600
Make's people forget things they knew

23
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,020
Well, it's easy to see, O.. it's happenin' to me

24
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,480
Caus I've already forgotten every woman but you

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,240
Oh, darlin', I'm gonna love you forever

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,300
Forever and ever, amen

27
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,240
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather

28
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,680
As long as old women sit and talk about old men

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,880
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,940
Ooo... Just listen to how this song ends

31
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:21,260
Oh Darling.. I'm gonna love you forever and ever

32
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:35,020
Forever and ever 3x, Amen...

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:45,040
Hu...... Hu.. Hu.... Hu... Hu...
