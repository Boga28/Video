1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,520
So you said, "Har work",

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:04,880
okay.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,920
And it's really common

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,080
for the Singaporeans to not

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,800
say the last letter of "hard".

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,880
The sound, "d",

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,760
needs to be pronounced.

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,440
So, "hard work".

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,960
Hard work.

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,920
If you did it normally,

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,960
you would say, "hard work".

12
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,720
Don't say the d.

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,240
You also said, "at the brink off",

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,920
and it should be,

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,280
"on the brink of".

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,440
Yeah, I realize that mistake,

17
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,520
but I had already said it

18
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,400
and I just wanted

19
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,760
to keep going on.

20
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,560
Wonderful.

21
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,440
And you said,

22
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,960
"it's more of",

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,560
and you were talking about something.

24
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,320
I would say, "it's more about".

25
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,160
But overall,

26
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,400
you had so few mistakes,

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,200
you would be on the brink,

28
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,840
you'd be on the brink of an 8.5 or

29
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,520
a maximum of 9.

30
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,040
So that's really, really excellent.

31
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,040
You spoke wonderfully throughout this

32
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,800
and I think lots of students

33
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,440
will take away some of the things that you've said

34
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,800
and they'll be able to learn from it.

35
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
So, thank you for your time, Elisha, today.

36
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,200
Thank you so much.

37
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,280
Hello and welcome to this mock exam session.

38
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,120
I'm so happy to have you back.

39
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,160
Today we have the wonderful student, Elisha.

40
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,280
She's from Singapore

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,760
and she has a couple of areas

42
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,440
where she could improve.

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
I also want to think about

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,040
and what you would do

45
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
if you had an examiner who is really friendly

46
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,840
or if you had an examiner

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
who was a little bit more serious.

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,120
Maybe they didn't give you anything back

49
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,280
in terms of body language.

50
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,840
We hear from students all the time

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
that some examiners are really friendly

52
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,880
and some examiners are a little bit miserable.

53
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,040
They don't smile,

54
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,720
they don't give you anything back.

55
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,800
So be prepared for both.

56
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,320
Are you ready to begin this video?

57
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,040
Come on, let's go.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,080
Hello and welcome to this practice exam

59
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,760
conducted by IELTS daily.

60
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,280
My name is Maddie,

61
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,280
and I'm your practice examiner.

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,120
The questions in this test are designed

63
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,120
to simulate the IELTS speaking test.

64
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,960
Let's start.

65
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,320
What's your first name, please?

66
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,080
Alright. I'm just gonna stop there

67
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,680
because this is quite important.

68
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,080
In one of our previous videos

69
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
which you can see that Saskia

70
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,280
and lots of you were giving feedback

71
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,200
on our Youtube channel

72
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,120
that the examiner was really friendly.

73
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,720
Now for some of you,

74
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,920
that's really surprising

75
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,800
because in your country,

76
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,360
maybe your examiner is quite serious.

77
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,760
Maybe they don't have any emotions on their face.

78
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,080
It really depends on the examiner

79
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,520
and it depends on the day.

80
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,240
So if you have a friendly examiner like Maddie,

81
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:40,960
that's normal.

82
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,160
Also if you have a serious examiner,

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
don't be put off.

84
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,360
Just keep talking as though

85
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,640
you're talking to a friend.

86
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,720
So in this case, we have Maddie.

87
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,000
She's really friendly.

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,760
She smiles and she nods along

89
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,040
which is really helpful.

90
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
it's more like a real conversation.

91
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,960
I really wish all examiners did that.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,920
My first name is Elisha.

93
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,720
Thanks Elisha.

94
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,880
At the beginning of the IELTS test,

95
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,200
you will be required to provide some ID.

96
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,640
But as this is a practice test,

97
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
we don't need to do that today.

98
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,640
I want to begin by talking about you.

99
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,880
Do you work or do you study?

100
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,440
I'm currently studying right now.

101
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,160
I'm studying in the University of Melbourne

102
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,240
and I'm majoring in psychology.

103
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,200
Do you enjoy what you study?

104
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,600
Yes I do enjoy it,

105
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,160
and I've always had like this fascination

106
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,400
about psychology and about understanding

107
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
people, and learning about the different theories,

108
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
and how the brain works,

109
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,560
and how you can apply that

110
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,560
to reality, and how you can communicate

111
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,760
and understand people better.

112
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,720
Do you want to study more in the future?

113
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,920
Yes.

114
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,389
I'm actually thinking of doing a masters.

115
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,880
I'm a bit unsure whether

116
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,760
I want to go into the business side,

117
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,120
so I might study on consumer behavior.

118
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,280
So you learn about people

119
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,600
and how they react to different,

120
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,320
different things,

121
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,960
so when you're trying to sell the product,

122
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
you got to understand the consumers

123
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,920
and what they like,

124
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,280
what they don't like,

125
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,440
so I'm a bit I'm confused.

126
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,679
I might actually pursue clinical psychology.

127
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,080
So doing an honors in psychology,

128
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,920
so that I can become a psychologist.

129
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,320
Okay.

130
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,280
I'm just gonna stop here

131
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
and talk a little bit about pronunciation.

132
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Now clearly, Elisha spoke at length.

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,040
She didn't stop speaking

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,360
and spoke really, really well.

135
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
Lots of complexity in her grammar,

136
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,480
but I want to focus on pronunciation

137
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,840
because there's a feature

138
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,560
of her pronunciation called,

139
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,720
"The Glottal Stop".

140
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,400
The Glottal Stop.

141
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,400
Now for those people who know

142
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
about anatomy and physiology,

143
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,000
the epiglottis is the flap which moves

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,280
when you want to speak

145
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,720
or if you want to eat.

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,520
And it stops the air from going into your lungs

147
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,200
and it allows the air to go into your lungs,

148
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,240
opens and closes.

149
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,320
Now in speech,

150
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
there is the glottal stop

151
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,760
and the glottal stop is used

152
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,920
really commonly with native speakers.

153
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,320
Look at the sentence below,

154
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,520
and notice how I pronounce it.

155
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,920
What time?

156
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,680
What time?

157
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,800
Did you notice that I didn't say,

158
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,600
"WhaT time?",

159
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,840
so "what", the air continues.

160
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,200
What.

161
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,120
And it finishes here

162
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,240
because you can hear thaT.

163
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,600
whaT.

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,280
What time?

165
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,120
But I don't say that.

166
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,160
I actually say, "what time?".

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,960
And you notice that the air comes up, "what",

168
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,440
stops at the epiglottis and does not continue.

169
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
And this is a feature called,

170
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,840
"The Glottal Stop".

171
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,040
And Elisha used it a couple of times.

172
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,480
She said, "Abou(t)".

173
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Abou(t).

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,680
Instead of abouT.

175
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,280
AbouT.

176
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,960
And it really is a feature

177
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,680
that native speakers use.

178
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,560
And in order for you to reach higher levels

179
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,480
of pronunciation score in the IELTS speaking test,

180
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,520
you need to be thinking

181
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,360
about these types of techniques.

182
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
They don't come naturally;

183
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,720
you have to practice.

184
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,640
And you have to listen to native speakers.

185
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,840
It's a really useful feature

186
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,800
for you to think about.

187
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,880
So, yeah.

188
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,360
Currently deciding whether I want to

189
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,360
pursue a master's in consumer behavior or

190
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,120
I wanna, I wanna continue

191
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,000
doing honors in psychology.

192
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,880
Did you also notice that

193
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
in this part of the speech,

194
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,000
Elisha says,

195
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,120
"I wanna"?

196
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,160
I wanna.

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,360
Now, I had this question from our other videos.

198
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,480
Students are not allowed to contract speech

199
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,240
or they're not allowed to use slang.

200
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,320
Well, first of all, wanna is not really slang.

201
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,680
Wanna is just contracted speech.

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,200
"I want to", "I wanna".

203
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,520
And it is absolutely normal for you

204
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,160
to use that during IELTS speaking test.

205
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,800
You have to speak naturally.

206
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
So for those people who are a little bit dubious

207
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
or if you're doubting this,

208
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,520
really, really, really,

209
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
it's important that you

210
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,520
use natural contracted speech.

211
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,280
Don't use it in writing, though.

212
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,720
Let's continue.

213
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,160
Okay.

214
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,040
Let's move on to the topic of picnics.

215
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,840
Do you enjoy going for a picnic?

216
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
Yes, I think it's actually a really fun activity

217
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,200
to do with your friends or your families.

218
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,560
And I've actually been to,

219
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,080
I've just recently,

220
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
I had a picnic with my friends

221
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,160
and we went to the beach to have the picnic,

222
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,920
and I thought it was really fun because

223
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,920
given the circumstances of 2020 year,

224
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,760
with the whole COVID situation,

225
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,520
I feel like, the first thing I want to do

226
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
is just to have quality time

227
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,320
with my friends and family

228
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,880
after not being able to physically see them.

229
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,120
So I thought, like, having a picnic

230
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,000
is a really good time to actually

231
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,720
talk to people again and reconnect

232
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,640
instead of just using your phone

233
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,360
or like , just playing video games

234
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,400
or watching like Netflix or something.

235
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,960
So I do enjoy having picnics

236
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,039
especially like, when you're outside.

237
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,839
You can really just like take it all in

238
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,680
and enjoy the scenery

239
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,160
and it's just a more chill vibe

240
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,160
than just, I'm going to a restaurant

241
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,840
and it's more personal for me.

242
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,400
I heard Elisha say,

243
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,520
"After not be able to".

244
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,760
After not be able to.

245
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
I don't quite think I heard,

246
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,600
"after not being able to",

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
and that's the correct form.

248
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,280
After not being able to.

249
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,640
So, after + ing.

250
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,360
I heard, "after not being able to".

251
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,760
But she did have some really good

252
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,600
complexity within her grammar.

253
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
So she said something like,

254
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
"Given the situation of COVID last year".

255
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
So, "given" is a great way to start a sentence.

256
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
She probably spoke a little bit

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,640
more than she needed to,

258
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,120
but great expansion on her answers.

259
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,960
And what types of food do you take with you?

260
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,200
I would usually just take like, pastries

261
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,840
or like sushi and drinks.

262
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,040
Or even like, cheese platter.

263
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,000
We usually just bring one item each

264
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,240
and so, like, everyone contributes

265
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,280
something to the picnic.

266
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,720
But it depends on like, the day,

267
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,240
is all, like, usually if I would have a picnic,

268
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,600
it would be a very sunny day.

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,400
So definitely,

270
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,800
cooled drinks and sushi ,

271
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,840
like cheese platter and dessert as well.

272
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,320
Conditional sentences.

273
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,040
"If I were".

274
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,040
Now many of you would say,

275
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,640
grammatically that would be incorrect.

276
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,000
But it's totally normal,

277
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,520
it's called the subjunctive.

278
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,400
The subjunctive.

279
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,600
And look below.

280
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,360
It's, "If I were".

281
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,600
If I were to meet the prime minister,

282
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,360
I would be very humble,

283
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,760
If I were to wake up late tomorrow,

284
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
I would be in trouble.

285
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,000
So this is an example where the subjunctive,

286
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,200
and maybe we'll talk about that in a future video,

287
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,960
you can make, what would be a grammatical mistake.

288
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,840
You can also say,

289
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,720
"If I was".

290
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,800
But in this case she said, "If I were".

291
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
I also heard a few more glottal stops,

292
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,240
which were great.

293
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,400
We will listen very shortly to Elisha,

294
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,120
where she maybe, uses a glottal stop

295
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,520
where a typical native speaker would not.

296
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,400
Let's keep listening.

297
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,680
And do you remember the last picnic

298
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,720
you went on?

299
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,680
Yes, I do.

300
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I just went last week

301
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,320
and we went to St. Kilda Beach

302
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,560
to just have a picnic

303
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,720
and afterwards, watch the sunset.

304
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
And it was really amazing

305
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,600
because like, I thought it was really peaceful.

306
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,440
It's been a while since I've been out,

307
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,600
given the whole COVID situation.

308
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,640
But, yeah.

309
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,160
It was really amazing to finally see my friends

310
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,520
and to finally enjoy their company

311
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,800
and enjoy the food,

312
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,000
and I would love to picnic again soon

313
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,840
with my friends, all my family.

314
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,360
Great.

315
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,280
Now, three words for you here.

316
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:01,600
Went.

317
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
And I heard her say, "We went".

318
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,560
And that would be an example of a glottal stop.

319
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,920
Can you hear that, "we went"?

320
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,240
And that's typical.

321
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,920
Many people who are native speakers

322
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,720
would use that one.

323
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,120
Another one was, "picnic".

324
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,640
Picnic.

325
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,280
You didn't hear her say, "PiCKniCK".

326
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,640
She said, "picnic".

327
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,920
And that's another good example

328
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,800
of a glottal stop.

329
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,640
One which I'm just a little bit doubtful of,

330
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,560
but I did understand it, was "food".

331
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,480
Food.

332
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,720
If you listen to Elisha, she says, "foo",

333
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,480
rather than food.

334
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,440
Can you hear the, "d"

335
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,320
at the end of food?

336
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,680
So just be careful.

337
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,960
I would say if you are from Singapore,

338
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,880
just be careful that

339
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,640
some of your "d" sounds are often lost.

340
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,080
And I would argue that a typical examiner

341
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,880
may, may, may, may mark you down,

342
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
if they're very strict.

343
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,920
New Zealand, Australia, Canada,

344
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
America, the United Kingdom.

345
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,320
These are all places where English is spoken

346
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,160
as a primary first language

347
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
and therefore,

348
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
they are probably looking for this

349
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,480
standardization of pronunciation.

350
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,320
We'll hear some more probably little

351
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,840
mistakes from Elisha very soon.

352
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,880
And are there any problems

353
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
which could happen during a picnic?

354
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,160
Well, yeah.

355
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,320
There was a problem that we were facing

356
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,560
and that was seagulls, like they kept

357
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,120
trying to come and get our food.

358
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,640
So that was just one of the major problems

359
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,960
and the sand as well,

360
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,200
cause it gets all over as well

361
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,040
when the wind blows and everything.

362
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,200
But I mean, overall,

363
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,440
there was just one of

364
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,320
the very few annoying things that happens.

365
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,800
Now, I want to talk about music.

366
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,080
What sort of music do you enjoy listening to?

367
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,200
It really depends on my mood.

368
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,240
I would say that I listen to music everyday

369
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,320
and it really just depends on how I'm feeling.

370
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,800
Some days,

371
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,080
I feel energetic

372
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,560
and I would listen to more upbeat music

373
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,440
like pop or ETM (Electronic Dance Music),

374
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,960
and the ideas, well, like,

375
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,600
I listen to indie and slower songs.

376
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,880
And there are also

377
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,880
days I listen to rap music.

378
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,680
It all depends, but, yeah.

379
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,560
Recently I've been getting into a lot more

380
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,920
of the indie music and all.

381
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,480
But yeah, it just really depends on my mood.

382
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,400
And do you find that music helps you study?

383
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,520
Yes. I actually listen to music a lot

384
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,800
when I'm studying

385
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
and I think it's very different,

386
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
it really depends on the person.

387
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,600
So, I know one of my friends,

388
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,360
they can't listen to music at all,

389
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,920
and just have to shut everything out.

390
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,280
But I personally have to listen to music,

391
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,320
so yeah. And the music that I listen to it's,

392
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:58,800
I would say,

393
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,280
not a lot of people listen to as well.

394
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,680
Like I would listen to actually,

395
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,200
like ETM music.

396
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,480
So a lot of people find it

397
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,960
extremely hard to concentrate,

398
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,320
but I feel like it actually

399
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,680
stimulates my brain more

400
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,800
and it gets me more hyped up and happy,

401
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,920
happier to actually continue studying,

402
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,960
it like motivates me, but yeah.

403
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,920
I have other friends that

404
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,200
listen to music while studying

405
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,840
and they tend to listen to classical music, which

406
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,560
I understand it actually,

407
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,320
well there's a lot of scientific evidence

408
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,960
that show that classical music actually helps you

409
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,000
like study and get concentrated as well.

410
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,400
Okay, two things I want to talk about here.

411
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,720
The first one is collocation.

412
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,600
Collocation is when

413
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,760
you fit two words together naturally.

414
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,200
A great example would be:

415
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,120
It gets me hyped up.

416
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
It gets me hyped up.

417
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
To be hyped up means:

418
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,840
it gets me energized.

419
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,080
The problem that I saw in this particular

420
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,840
section of speech is that she

421
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,920
repeated the same term a few times.

422
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
I probably heard it four times

423
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,680
and she said: it depends on.

424
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,720
It depends on my mood.

425
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,840
It depends on how I'm feeling.

426
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,080
Just be careful that you do need

427
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,960
to use a variety of different terms and phrases.

428
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,440
Try not to repeat the same thing again and again.

429
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,520
Are there any types of music you don't enjoy?

430
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
I personally don't really enjoy country music.

431
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,560
But it really just depends

432
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,000
on the person and the background

433
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,960
that you grew up in

434
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,280
because I didn't grow up

435
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,960
listening to a lot of country.

436
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,120
But I know that there are people

437
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,760
that enjoy country music that come from

438
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,640
the countryside or different countries.

439
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,960
They really just focus, like in America,

440
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,280
they are quite heavy in southern states,

441
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,720
that they are quite heavy with country music and,

442
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,760
yeah, but I grew up in an environment

443
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,360
where it was mostly

444
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,600
what my friends were listening to

445
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,120
which was mostly pop or rap music.

446
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
People my age usually listen to

447
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,800
pop and rap, and indie as well.

448
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,599
Okay, okay.

449
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,439
We just talked about collocation

450
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,280
and we talked about, "hyped up".

451
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,720
In this case, she says:

452
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,600
They are quite heavy with.

453
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,599
This for me,

454
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,879
would be an example of probably

455
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,240
an incorrect collocation.

456
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,680
We wouldn't hear that normally.

457
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,280
Somebody's quite heavily into something.

458
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,840
So people are very heavily into something,

459
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,760
but we wouldn't normally say:

460
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
they are very heavy with something,

461
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,120
particularly with music.

462
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,440
And do you enjoy listening to live music?

463
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,400
I personally don't really

464
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,160
prefer listening to it live.

465
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,080
Only because sometimes

466
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,040
when you're watching it live

467
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
like, going to concerts and stuff,

468
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,920
it gets it tends to get a bit crowded

469
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,400
and sometimes I can't even hear anything

470
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,840
because they're just people around me screaming.

471
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
But it really depends if the concert was held

472
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,400
in a smaller venue and there were,

473
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
and it was more personal

474
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,160
and I would prefer that.

475
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,920
But I was held in a stadium

476
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,320
which I've been to, it was really key of it

477
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
in the sense that I couldn't see anything,

478
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
and I couldn't hear anybody, like,

479
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,200
I couldn't hear like the actual singer

480
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,400
like I went to a Taylor Swift concert,

481
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,600
I went to Justin Bieber

482
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,520
and I could not even hear them

483
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,760
like properly because they're just like

484
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,640
people around me just screaming constantly.

485
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,880
Fantastic.

486
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
Did you notice here,

487
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
this is a really great tip for you guys:

488
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
Just talk as though you're talking to a friend.

489
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
She spoke really naturally to the examiner

490
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
and told a story about going to a concert.

491
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,040
She explained why

492
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,360
she didn't particularly like this concert,

493
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,320
but talked about why

494
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,760
she would prefer another concert.

495
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:54,960
Really great.

496
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,440
I think, yeah, again, it really depends

497
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,480
on the personality and what interests you.

498
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,040
Here we go again.

499
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,200
it depends, it depends, it depends.

500
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,040
I've probably heard that phrase now

501
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,440
six or seven times

502
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
in the past two or three minutes.

503
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm going to give you a topic

504
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,920
and I'd like you to talk about it

505
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,120
for one to two minutes.

506
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,640
Before you talk,

507
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
you'll have one minute to think about

508
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,360
what you're going to say

509
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,800
and you can make notes if you wish.

510
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
Here is a paper and pencil for you to make notes.

511
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,000
And here is your topic:

512
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
Let's have a quick brainstorm

513
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,320
about this particular topic. It's:

514
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,480
Describe a prize you've received.

515
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,680
Now, maybe you have

516
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,040
or haven't received a prize.

517
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,840
If you have, great.

518
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,080
Talk about it as much as possible.

519
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,760
Where were you, what did you receive,

520
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,040
why did you receive it,

521
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,560
how did you feel when you received it.

522
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,960
Talk about whether you still use that prize now.

523
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Do you still have it, etc?

524
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,440
Maybe if you haven't won a prize yourself,

525
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,800
talk about somebody who has

526
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,000
or talk about a prize that

527
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,720
maybe you want to receive in the future.

528
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,120
Lots and lots of ideas

529
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,560
for you to talk about there.

530
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,000
And if you're really stuck,

531
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,680
just make up anything.

532
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,280
Pretend that you once won an Oscar or a TV award

533
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,000
At the end of the day,

534
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,560
the examiner doesn't know that you haven't.

535
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,800
So be prepared to make something up.

536
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:19,840
Okay.

537
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
I would like you to describe a prize

538
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,560
you have received.

539
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,680
So just thinking back about the most important

540
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,680
price I've received was actually a certificate

541
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,720
and that certificate for to me

542
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,240
was really important because

543
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,160
it really showed, like, determination

544
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,320
and perseverance, as well as hard work.

545
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,680
Really does pay off.

546
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,240
So I received this prize when I was in high school

547
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,960
and it was after my major exams, it's IGCSE.

548
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,560
So it was like high school exam and

549
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,720
I received this prize for being

550
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,160
one of the top students

551
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,240
in physics and chemistry.

552
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,360
And to me, that was really like, for me,

553
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
I was really happy when I received it

554
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,920
because at the start of the school year,

555
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:16,000
I was just not doing well

556
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
for physics and chemistry, and I was

557
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,000
at the brink of failing the subject.

558
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,160
And actually, yeah, so I got about

559
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,960
fifty on the dot for the subject

560
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,120
just before my major exams

561
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,880
and I thought that I wasn't gonna do well.

562
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,200
But during the last month where it was,

563
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,800
thought there, and we were just studying

564
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,480
and just preparing for the exams,

565
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,280
I really just put in so much effort

566
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
to really understanding and learning the concepts.

567
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
I would spend the entire day,

568
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,240
entire morning and afternoon

569
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,120
just revising and practicing exam questions and

570
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,960
I'm just reading the textbook

571
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,760
and just staying back with my tutor

572
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,800
to just ask questions and go through

573
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,000
all of the questions I got wrong.

574
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
So when I received the prize,

575
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,840
I was really shocked at first

576
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,600
because I didn't expect that

577
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,240
I would do well in it.

578
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,360
It just made me feel a lot better about myself

579
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,840
and it gave me this drive that

580
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,520
if you put your mind to it,

581
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,240
you can really succeed in the things

582
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:26,800
that you do.

583
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,520
There we go.

584
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,640
Why do you think

585
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
you have that extra motivation after

586
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,360
you were just hitting bang on the fifty?

587
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,400
I think it was the fear of not doing well

588
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,280
and the fear of not

589
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,920
getting into a good university.

590
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,440
It was the fear of my future and I was afraid

591
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,720
that if I didn't do well,

592
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,360
it would affect, how I, how,

593
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,120
which university I would get in

594
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,840
and it would affect a job

595
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
that I actually wanted for a long time.

596
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
I wanted to be a psychologist.

597
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,160
I wanted to do,

598
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,920
I want to go into that field

599
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,640
and so I think that was my main motivation.

600
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,960
And the fear that would fail and not do well,

601
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,960
and disappoint my parents and myself,

602
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,560
so I really wanted to show that

603
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,360
you really put in the effort.

604
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,160
You can do almost anything.

605
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,040
I think Elisha gave a great part 2 answer here.

606
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,960
She spoke at length

607
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,600
and she really expanded on her answers.

608
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,960
A few things: True.

609
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,720
True.

610
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,320
I think she wanted to say, "through".

611
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,080
Through.

612
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
This is common for people

613
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,000
from Malaysia or from Singapore

614
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
to say, "true".

615
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,720
Yes, so instead of three ,

616
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,160
they might say, "tree"

617
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,360
and through, they would say, "true".

618
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
It's not a native feature of pronunciation

619
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,920
to say "ch" for the "th" sound.

620
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,840
So I'm just concerned

621
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,680
that a really strict examiner

622
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,840
would mark her down on pronunciation for this.

623
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,200
She also said, "at the brink of failing".

624
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,960
At the brink of failing.

625
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,080
I would personally say,

626
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,440
"On the brink of failing",

627
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,960
but I think both of them

628
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,920
are really great features of language.

629
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,600
Great lexical resource,

630
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,840
less common lexical item.

631
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,960
So, at the brink of or on the brink of.

632
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,680
Those mean at the edge.

633
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,800
So she was on the edge or at the edge of failing.

634
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,200
Now, let's talk about prizes and competitions.

635
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,560
Do you think prizes are important?

636
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,160
I think it is important in the sense that

637
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,480
not necessarily you have to receive

638
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,880
a medal, a big gold medal,

639
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
a lot of money, cash prize.

640
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,560
But it's more of the reward that you get

641
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,960
and the satisfaction that you get after.

642
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,600
It's more of, giving that,

643
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,520
telling someone that you know you did well.

644
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
So you're acknowledging the person,

645
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,800
the person's contribution and what they did,

646
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,080
and that can really help motivate that person

647
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,760
to do more and to benefit in the future,

648
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,600
and help themselves grow as a person.

649
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,800
And do we give too many prizes nowadays?

650
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,000
I would say yes and no.

651
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,640
It really depends on what the situation is.

652
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
I feel like there are times where

653
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,720
there's not a lot of prize to be won.

654
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,240
For example, like a case competition.

655
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,120
I feel like it's really competitive

656
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,120
and not a lot of people get acknowledged

657
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,400
for the effort they put in.

658
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,200
So I think on that aspect, like, there could be

659
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
more prizes and more acknowledgement

660
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,880
for their asset.

661
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,120
Because I remember I had a friend

662
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,200
who entered into the case competition

663
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,400
and he just focused on it every single day

664
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,240
and he will stay up till early morning

665
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,840
to just complete it and he put in a lot of effort,

666
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,280
but at the end of the day,

667
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,280
it was really hard because like,

668
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,320
he came in like that,

669
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
but there was no like,

670
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,280
acknowledgment for him.

671
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,680
So I think it can be discouraging

672
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,200
at times but, yeah.

673
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,080
It really depends.

674
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,920
More Glottal stops here used really well.

675
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,960
So she said, "not a lot of".

676
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,120
Not a Lof.

677
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,520
Not a lot of.

678
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,880
This is two Glottal stops there.

679
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,560
Not a lot of.

680
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,480
Do you notice how she drops the, "t"?

681
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,840
Not a lot of people get acknowledged.

682
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,440
So this phrase is great

683
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
because it also uses

684
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,120
the passive form.

685
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,760
Not a lot of people get acknowledged.

686
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,000
That the passive form of the verb.

687
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,240
Also, she then starts to use flexible language

688
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,840
and she changes the word, "acknowledged" and

689
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,160
uses the word, "acknowledgement"

690
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,760
in the next sentence.

691
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,320
So she's really showing how flexible

692
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,400
and wide her vocabulary is.

693
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,760
Great, great job Elisha.

694
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,520
And do competitions always have good outcomes?

695
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,200
I don't think all compositions have good outcomes.

696
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,640
It just really depends as well.

697
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,960
So, for example, like winning a race

698
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,480
and if you come in fourth for something,

699
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,280
it can really like make you feel just really down

700
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
and beat yourself up for it.

701
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,320
So at the end of the day,

702
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
it also depends on the person

703
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,800
and how they take, like, how they take

704
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,600
not being the winner or just how

705
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,800
they react to it as well.

706
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,280
But yeah, it really depends on the situation.

707
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,600
Here's our depend friend, again, Elisha.

708
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,360
She's used it a couple more times

709
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,120
in the past minute or so.

710
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,320
It really depends,

711
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,040
it's a phrase that I think when you are nervous

712
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,880
or when you're sitting an exam

713
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,680
because the pressure that you're under

714
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,920
makes you kind of forget

715
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,600
some of the things you've said.

716
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,840
Just be aware not to repeat

717
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,680
the same phrase too many times.

718
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,760
Why do some people cheat in competitions?

719
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,280
Well, I think it's just the fear of just

720
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,600
not getting, not being taught,

721
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,040
it's the fear that, you don't trust yourself

722
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,400
to actually succeed.

723
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,240
You don't trust your own abilities

724
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,640
and it's the insecurity that

725
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,160
you're not good enough.

726
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,200
So a lot of the times, personally,

727
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
I feel that people do cheat

728
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,800
because they think that

729
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,320
they're not gonna do well

730
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,160
and they're not going to make it

731
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,560
so that's why they cheat.

732
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,280
But that's for most of the time

733
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,040
they don't rely on themselves.

734
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,480
Thank you very much.

735
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,400
That is the end of the speaking test.

736
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:28,880
Okay.

737
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
So Elisha has done really fantastically today.

738
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,760
I would probably give her a 9.

739
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,120
Probably.

740
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,000
But there are some areas

741
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,320
where a really strict examiner

742
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,880
would listen and maybe mark her down.

743
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,800
Tell us what you think

744
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,320
in the comments about this

745
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,280
because in the pronunciation section,

746
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,320
it asks you to use a wide variety of features,

747
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
but you have to use them

748
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,360
pretty accurately all the time

749
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,160
and I wonder about the glottal stop.

750
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,160
She said things like:

751
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,960
col, drink, and goo idea,

752
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,240
rather than:

753
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,160
cold and good.

754
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,200
Remember the glottal stop.

755
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,480
It stops here.

756
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,080
Cold and good.

757
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,840
I just wonder whether a stricter examiner

758
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,160
may mark her down for that.

759
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,280
I also worry that the repetition that she used,

760
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,760
"It depends",

761
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,640
could also be an area

762
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,160
where they mark her down.

763
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,640
So as a result,

764
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm going to be looking on this.

765
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:41,920
I'm going to be erring on the side of caution.

766
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm going to be cautious

767
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,560
and I'm going to score her 9

768
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,840
for fluency and coherence,

769
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,800
she spoke really well.

770
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,520
I'm going to score her 9

771
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,440
for grammatical range and accuracy,

772
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,040
she used lots of different features

773
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,600
and she was grammatically pretty correct

774
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,440
the whole time, great job.

775
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,520
I'm gonna score her 9 for lexical resource,

776
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,040
because the level of her language was wonderful.

777
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,800
She did repeat some ideas a few times.

778
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,760
So 9 for that one,

779
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,080
but I'm going to go down to an 8

780
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,600
for pronunciation because of this

781
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,800
glottal stop error.

782
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,440
Some of you will say,

783
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,720
"Yes. But she spoke,

784
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
most of the time was really understandable."

785
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,320
I'm just looking at it

786
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,200
from the point of view

787
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,680
of a really strict examiner.

788
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,480
So overall:

789
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,760
9-9-9-8 would be an 8.5 overall

790
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,920
because remember, .75 and .25

791
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,080
marks are rounded down.

792
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,000
Do we think that's fair?

793
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,040
I don't think that's fair

794
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,800
but that's what happens in the IELTS test.

795
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,040
So today, we talked about

796
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,760
how to prepare for an examiner

797
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,920
who maybe is a little bit more serious.

798
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,040
Just talk to them like you're talking to a friend.

799
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,720
We also talked about

800
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,960
the idea of the glottal stop.

801
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,600
Try to incorporate the glottal stop

802
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,880
into some of your speech.

803
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Keep practicing and listening to native speakers

804
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,000
and how they use it in their speech too.

805
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,520
Thanks for joining!

806
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,280
It's been a wonderful session today.

807
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,160
I hope you come back.

808
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,320
We have lots more of our videos.

809
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,240
You'll see them on the screen now.

810
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,840
Come and watch the mock exam videos.

811
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,720
I really hope they are useful for you

812
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,080
and that you are able to learn

813
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,560
something on how to reach a high level score.

814
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,840
Bye for now.
