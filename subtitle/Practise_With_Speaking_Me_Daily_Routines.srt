00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,657
Hey Lady! is an online community where women from around

2
00:00:03,657 --> 00:00:07,357
the world meet to practise speaking English together.

3
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:10,926
It's the easiest way to find English-speaking friends and to get

4
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:15,128
regular practice, the practice that you need to speak English

5
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:16,934
confidently and fluently.

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:20,047
Hey Lady! is a safe and supportive space for women

7
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:23,719
with an intermediate to advanced level of English.

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:27,085
Come and visit us at heylady.io and discover

9
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:30,240
the English speaking version of you today.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,261
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish and it's time

11
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:42,510
to practise speaking with me.

12
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,290
We're going to practise talking about daily routines using

13
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,947
my daily routine as an example.

14
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:51,943
So we'll get to talk about my morning routine,

15
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:54,129
what I do before I go to work,

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,169
my workday routine, what I do at work during the day

17
00:00:59,169 --> 00:01:01,643
and my evening routine.

18
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:02,814
So maybe

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,349
you like to watch Netflix or read a book or clean the house

20
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:08,841
or go out for dinner.

21
00:01:08,989 --> 00:01:12,956
I'm going to talk about my evening routine as an example.

22
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:16,797
I'll give you lots of chances to speak out loud and to practise with

23
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:20,000
me and the cool thing is we're also going to brush up on

24
00:01:20,292 --> 00:01:23,743
a little bit of grammar that you might need to use to talk about 

25
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:28,554
how regularly you do things in your daily routine.

26
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,345
When talking about our daily routines,

27
00:01:36,345 --> 00:01:39,125
we use the present simple tense.

28
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,810
I eat breakfast at 7am.

29
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,136
But adverbs of frequency can add more detail. They work

30
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:49,776
perfectly to this and I can choose any of these ones

31
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,429
to talk about how often I do something

32
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:57,061
and that's why they're called adverbs of frequency. They show

33
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:01,183
how often something happens or how often you do something.

34
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:04,188
Now for me, I would say

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,970
No. I never eat breakfast at 7am.

36
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:12,868
That's a little too early for me. You try it.

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,748
I always have my coffee before breakfast.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,062
So if you use always it means that you're doing that activity

39
00:02:31,062 --> 00:02:34,105
a hundred percent of the time, every time

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,743
but as that frequency gets less and less, your adverb can change

41
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,121
to usually,

42
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,033
sometimes,

43
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:44,456
rarely,

44
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,858
hardly ever

45
00:02:45,858 --> 00:02:48,653
until you get to never which is

46
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:50,414
zero per cent of the time.

47
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,388
Can you think of something you always do in the morning,

48
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:57,673
what about something that you hardly ever do?

49
00:02:57,673 --> 00:02:59,711
I want to hear about it down in the comments.

50
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,920
Now it's time for the fun part.

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,403
Here is a list of activities that you might do in the morning.

52
00:03:06,403 --> 00:03:09,960
I've marked the ones that I do and you can do the same

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,403
or you can note down a few different ideas if you like.

54
00:03:13,718 --> 00:03:16,827
Now some of these activities are really common,

55
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,711
most of us do them every morning

56
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:23,355
like wake up, brush our teeth

57
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,846
get dressed, go to work.

58
00:03:25,846 --> 00:03:29,240
These are all things that happen pretty consistently.

59
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,161
So we'll practise using some adverbs that help to explain that.

60
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:36,151
I usually wake up at 6.30am.

61
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
Try it.

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,461
You can also say 6.30 or half-past six.

63
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:48,827
There are lots of different ways to express time in English,

64
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:49,801
aren't there?

65
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,410
But pay attention to the way that I said usually

66
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,796
with that sound and the 

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,150
Usually.

68
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:06,973
Try it.

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,840
I always brush my teeth as soon as I wake up.

70
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,724
I sit down at my desk and start working by 8am,

71
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:27,432
but I'm often a little late.

72
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,709
Notice that I didn't pronounce the T in often. 

73
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:40,795
Often. It's silent.

74
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,640
Though not for every native English speaker but  

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,982
I don't pronounce it.

76
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:46,712
Often.

77
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:49,998
Sometimes I go for a swim before work

78
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:52,877
but usually only when it's warm.

79
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,155
I hardly ever check my emails first thing in the morning.

80
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,360
Now to show the order of your routine you can use sequences

81
00:05:15,878 --> 00:05:17,318
like before,

82
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,524
after, then, next.

83
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:22,558
All of these words are useful to help you

84
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:25,273
organise your thoughts in order.

85
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:29,176
I usually walk my dog before I go for a swim.

86
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,640
After I get home, I make my coffee.

87
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,211
Then I start work for the day.

88
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,990
So even though I'm not giving you exact times,

89
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,395
you still have an idea about the order of these events,

90
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:06,905
which one happened first as soon as I woke up

91
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:10,142
and what was I doing just before I started work.

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,380
Our work routine is probably quite different.

93
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,347
Maybe your day at work is really dynamic and it's always changing

94
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:23,321
or perhaps it's pretty consistent and you do the same thing

95
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:27,185
every day so you'll have to adapt this section to make it

96
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,821
suit your workday.

97
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,931
We're going to use mine as an example to practise with.

98
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:34,980
I always have a meeting first thing in the morning

99
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,161
when I start work.

100
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,505
I usually work best in the morning.

101
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,618
That's when I'm most productive.

102
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,223
Sometimes, if I'm really focused on my work,

103
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:57,503
I won't even stop to eat lunch.

104
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,109
Well, until around 3pm when I get really hungry.

105
00:07:03,738 --> 00:07:04,881
You try it.

106
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,470
I often take a break around 4.30pm and go to the gym.

107
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,697
I hardly ever go for a walk outside,

108
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:27,007
but when I do, it boosts my energy levels.

109
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,512
I rarely finish my workday by 5pm.

110
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,729
The evenings are probably my favourite time of day.

111
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:51,712
I try to use that time to wind down and to relax

112
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,392
as long as I'm not working late.

113
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:57,365
What types of things do you do in the evenings?

114
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,886
I usually take my dog, Frankie, for a walk.

115
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:05,454
Often, we go to the park but sometimes we go to the beach.

116
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,829
I hardly ever cook. Shah usually does the cooking in our house

117
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,106
but sometimes we go out for dinner.

118
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,386
After dinner, sometimes we watch Netflix but

119
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:31,220
often we'll go back to work for an hour or two.

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,040
I never go to bed before 10pm

121
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,966
but I always try to wind down

122
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:45,000
by reading a book and drinking herbal tea.

123
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,753
So now that we've been through my daily routine,

124
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:57,537
I want you to share yours. I want you to write a few sentences

125
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,996
down, maybe in the comments below using the adverbs

126
00:09:00,996 --> 00:09:04,524
that we've been practising with but don't forget to practise

127
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:08,004
saying these things out loud too, okay?

128
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:09,951
Practise each morning this week,

129
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:12,300
the repetition is going to help you to remember

130
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:16,133
the different ideas but also get comfortable

131
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:20,000
saying these things and talking about them with ease.

132
00:09:20,075 --> 00:09:22,332
This is speaking practice after all.

133
00:09:22,332 --> 00:09:25,519
I hope you enjoyed today's speaking practice. I'm looking forward

134
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,469
to hearing about your daily routines.

135
00:09:28,858 --> 00:09:32,970
I'm wondering if it's similar to mine or maybe quite different.

136
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,222
Now if you're looking for some more speaking practice with me

137
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:39,962
then check out this lesson right here. It's all about telling

138
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:42,451
great stories in English.

139
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:46,240
So check it out and I'll see you next week with another video.
