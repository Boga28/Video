00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:06,540
Hi, it's your American English teacher Gabby from gonaturalenglish.com

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,549
Today we're going to test your English skills, but this test is not your typical

3
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:20,099
English test see there are no right or wrong answers

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,949
It's an assessment of your English level and I need you to be

5
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:34,049
Honest about what you can and cannot yet do the purpose of taking this test is to help you

6
00:00:34,329 --> 00:00:40,979
Understand how far you've come and how far you have to go if our goal is

7
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,290
English fluency

8
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,570
Confidence in speaking skills and the ability to understand native English speakers

9
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,460
then it's important to see where you are now and

10
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,930
how to get to your goals how to achieve

11
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:06,359
Your English speaking goals. So I'd like to ask you to take this test with me if you are up to the challenge

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,709
All right. Well, let's begin the quiz and see how you do for each of these questions. I'm going to ask you to rate yourself

13
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,270
Would you say?

14
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,830
rarely

15
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,830
sometimes or often

16
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,929
Here we go. Number one, you can speak English without

17
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,259
translating in your head

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,740
rarely

19
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,790
Sometimes or often if you have to stop to translate into your native language

20
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,919
Before you speak English. This is a real problem for many reasons

21
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:48,569
first of all, it really slows you down because you have to translate which is actually a lot of work and

22
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:55,320
Second the problem is that a lot of words and phrases lose their meaning or get lost in translation

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,739
So it's quite dangerous to do this actually because you might not get the true

24
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,578
Feeling of a word when you translate number two

25
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,169
You make very few errors and when you do you can catch your own mistakes

26
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:16,669
rarely some or often, you know that you're becoming aware of

27
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,669
English and mastering English when you can actually catch your own mistakes look

28
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,810
Everybody makes mistakes, even native English speakers even fluent English speakers even advanced English speakers

29
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:36,770
We all make mistakes at some point, but the important thing is to stop yourself and correct yourself

30
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,579
Be aware that you're making mistakes and improve on them

31
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,340
Now if you're still learning if you make a lot of mistakes

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:51,200
you're gonna need help to catch your mistakes and correct them 3 you can use a wide variety of

33
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,370
phrases and expressions

34
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,230
Including phrasal verbs idiom and sometimes slang

35
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,500
rarely sometimes or often the

36
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:07,309
Trouble is when you're an intermediate english learner you often reuse the same vocabulary

37
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,649
over and over and well this may get your point across it's not as

38
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:21,019
Expressive and you don't have as many options and you may not understand what native English speakers are saying when they use more

39
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,510
interesting or advanced or

40
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,869
colloquial expressions for you can talk about

41
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,010
technical or

42
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,810
specific topics

43
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:38,420
this is important if you're using English in your career, maybe a specific field like science or medicine or

44
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:44,750
Technology, if you can't talk about technical aspects of your career in English

45
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,640
Then that's a problem

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,809
And if you can't talk about specific interests that you're into with friends who speak English, that could be a problem

47
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,409
Too you'll be stuck at a lower level of English

48
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:04,939
If you can only make small talk, which is important, but we want to be able to communicate in a variety of situations

49
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,520
5 you can use all grammar tenses past present and future

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
easily with confidence

51
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:20,839
rarely sometimes or often in order to express yourself fully we need to have

52
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:23,210
mastery of a full range

53
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,580
of grammatical

54
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:32,460
Expressions. So if you're not really confident about all the tenses yet then keep going keep practicing until you can use

55
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,940
Them all with ease question six native and non-native

56
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,079
English speakers are impressed by your English

57
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,930
Rarely sometimes or often when someone is impressed by your English

58
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,410
They might say that you have great English skills

59
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,279
But just someone telling you that you're good at English doesn't necessarily mean that you really are good at English

60
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,089
they might just be giving you a compliment or wanting to encourage you or

61
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,079
They might be sincere and you might be really good at English

62
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:09,749
you know someone's really impressed when they understand what you're saying and

63
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,549
You can communicate what you want to express with ease

64
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:22,289
Maybe you help other people to understand who you are and what you do and what your goals are

65
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,229
Maybe you even teach people other things in

66
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,840
English if you can impress people with the way that you express yourself using

67
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:35,910
advanced vocabulary and interesting idiomatic expressions

68
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:39,899
Then you are at the advanced level of English seven

69
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,410
You understand humor and jokes in English the way a native speaker. Would have you ever been in a conversation?

70
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,019
Sitting around with a group of friends. Someone tells a joke and everyone laughs

71
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,359
But you just don't get it and maybe it's because you didn't get the joke in English

72
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:00,719
Well English is much deeper than just

73
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,869
Vocabulary and grammar its cultural and humor is part of culture, too

74
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:13,049
so we need to learn what people might consider funny in English as well as

75
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,199
Just grammar rules and other things like that

76
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:24,539
Once you understand why people are laughing you're at the advanced level of English and if you can tell jokes

77
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,959
Yourself you're at the advanced level of English eight. You don't usually get stuck in English

78
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,650
but when you do you find a way around it, if you don't know a specific vocabulary word you're able to

79
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:46,200
Describe it in other words and get your point across or get other people to understand you. Would you say rarely sometimes or

80
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,409
Often this is important because we all forget words. Sometimes we all get a little

81
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,859
Brain fog and can't think of a specific word

82
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,250
But the important thing is that you don't stop trying that you keep trying to get your point across

83
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:10,019
With other words and you have other words to do that number nine you are not uncomfortable or not

84
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,710
very afraid of speaking English with native English speakers rarely sometimes or

85
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,610
often

86
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,659
Fear is a big part of what holds us back

87
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:27,509
with English fluency because if you are afraid to approach native speakers or you are afraid to

88
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:35,909
participate in conversations with native speakers, you don't get that practice that you really need and so exposure and

89
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,820
Immersion to native English will help you break through to fluency number ten

90
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,779
You feel like you can express your true self in English. You don't feel fake you feel natural

91
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,510
rarely sometimes or often

92
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:57,869
This is really important even though sometimes people say that when they speak another language

93
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:05,218
They feel like another person. This is sometimes a side of you that comes out through the new language

94
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:10,259
It doesn't mean that it's fake. It's just another part of your natural self

95
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:18,419
So if you can express that that means you've mastered English if you feel like you're stuck or people don't really know

96
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,789
Who you truly are in English, then that can be something to work on

97
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
eleven English speakers

98
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,109
Easily understand you. This is about your pronunciation. It's

99
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,409
important that other people understand you

100
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,639
Also, of course, you have to understand other people, but in order to be fluent, you have to be understood as well

101
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,530
So if you notice that people are looking really confused when you speak English

102
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,829
Or maybe you don't get a response that makes sense. It could be that you need to improve your pronunciation

103
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:01,200
also, if people don't talk to you for a very long time that could mean maybe they just don't want to tell you that they

104
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,619
Don't understand what you're saying. Number 12, you understand TV shows movies the news

105
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,269
materials intended for native English speakers without

106
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,769
using subtitles

107
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:21,539
This is a big one many of you tell me that one of your goals in English is to be able to understand these

108
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,300
materials like movies TV shows music

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,659
the news all in English without

110
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:34,679
The help of subtitles or reading along. So if you can do this your English is

111
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,579
Advanced now if you answered mostly

112
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,409
Rarely, that means that we have quite a bit of work to do now

113
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:49,079
Don't stress out because you have already come a long ways and you can do a lot

114
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,489
But it's a good idea to think about what your goals are in

115
00:09:53,649 --> 00:10:00,899
English and how you can improve your skills in order to reach those goals that are most important to you if you answered mostly

116
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,189
Sometimes then keep going you're doing good work

117
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,469
You're on the road to fluency

118
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,410
And I'm sure that if you just keep going you will break through to fluency soon

119
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,839
And if you answered mostly

120
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,300
Often well. Congratulations

121
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:25,079
You're doing a fantastic job and you may already feel that you have broken through to fluency

122
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,829
Now you might need to fine-tune your skills a little bit

123
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:35,009
We're always learning new words and new ways of expressing ourselves in English as a second language

124
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:39,989
But you're doing a fantastic job and I commend you for your efforts

125
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:40,709
so

126
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:42,709

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:50,610
Understand your level of English and maybe to think about where you need to or want to improve your skills in
