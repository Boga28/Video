1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:03,166
There's always more room to grow.

2
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:05,200
There's always more knowledge to gain,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,566
always more skills to perfect.

4
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:10,833
We're never done with
the education process

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,533
because education is part
of the path to wealth.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Education and learning is
part of the path to health.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,633
Continued education can turn you around

8
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,333
if you're headed in the wrong direction.

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,966
We need the mental food
that others provide.

10
00:00:26,966 --> 00:00:29,366
We need mental exercise.

11
00:00:29,366 --> 00:00:32,566
We need to open up our minds
to different alternatives.

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,666
We need to learn to appreciate
the other side of the debate

13
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:40,366
so that we can strengthen
our own and defend our own.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,866
We need to expose ourselves
to a wide range of thoughts

15
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:47,633
and philosophies and ideologies.

16
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:50,966
You've got to listen to
a variety of speakers.

17
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:53,133
Read a variety of books.

18
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:56,666
No one speaker has all
the answers for you.

19
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,333
No one book has all the answers.

20
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:03,400
You can't get all the
answers from one person.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,800
We need a variety of
influence to give us input,

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,800
to give us ideas, to manage our business,

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,666
to manage our relationships,
to manage our finances,

24
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:17,066
to take advantage of our time.

25
00:01:17,066 --> 00:01:20,000
We need a variety of influences.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,866
We need a variety of books in our library.

27
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:26,500
We need a variety of tapes
in our video library,

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,966
our audio library.

29
00:01:27,966 --> 00:01:30,200
We need a variety of voices.

30
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:32,733
And here's what else we need.

31
00:01:32,733 --> 00:01:35,400
We need a variety of points of view.

32
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:39,466
Points of view can be so valuable.

33
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:43,066
Somebody says, "Did you
ever see it from over here?"

34
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:44,433
And you say, "No."

35
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,466
So, you step over there where they are

36
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:50,866
and you take a look back over
here from their point of view.

37
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:51,500
And you say,

38
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,566
"My gosh, I never thought
from this perspective,

39
00:01:55,566 --> 00:01:59,333
"it's so different. No wonder
you think the way you do."

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,566
Here's the clue, take advantage
of all that's available

41
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:06,966
in terms of mental food
and mental exercise.

42
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,566
Be eager to learn,

43
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:14,766
always be eager to learn no matter 
how far along you are in the journey,

44
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,866
no matter where you 
are in your success.

45
00:02:17,866 --> 00:02:19,866
Keep that eagerness to learn,

46
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:22,533
gather up as much knowledge as you can.

47
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:25,100
And then what? Debate it.

48
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,933
Put it all on the table
and look at it, dissect it,

49
00:02:28,933 --> 00:02:31,300
turn it around and stare at it.

50
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,900
Ask questions, make statements.

51
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,233
Don't take it for granted

52
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:38,866
that one person has all the
answers you're looking for.

53
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:40,466
Take their knowledge,

54
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,800
but don't take it as the only knowledge.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,300
Make sure that what you finally do,

56
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,800
the model you develop
of strong appreciation

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,766
for your own style and your own methods

58
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:54,466
and your own process for achievement,

59
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:57,566
make sure that what you finally do

60
00:02:57,566 --> 00:03:00,200
is a product of your own conclusion.

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,666
That's what's valuable.

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,733
Not to just go do what someone
says without debating it.

63
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:10,133
Consider the source and
then do it your way.

64
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:14,400
You can take an interest in
what someone says, digest it,

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,033
take notes on it, but then debate it.

66
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:19,366
Look at it from all angles.

67
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,466
Be a student, not a follower.

68
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,366
Building your ambition is a process

69
00:03:24,366 --> 00:03:27,133
unique to each and every one of us.

70
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:30,066
Gather all the knowledge that you can

71
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,433
then develop your approach

72
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:35,733
as a product of your own
conclusions, your own conclusions,

73
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:40,866
not someone else's conclusions,
your own conclusions.

74
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:43,600
You can't fall for other
people's philosophies.

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,866
They may not be right.

76
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,933
As you collect knowledge,

77
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:50,666
you must sort through it and
find out what's valuable.

78
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,766
Then you can develop your own philosophy.

79
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,800
And your own philosophy
becomes the most important

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
of your guidance systems.

81
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,633
One of your guiding lights.

82
00:04:01,566 --> 00:04:03,100
So, develop your own plan,

83
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,333
lest you get into trouble
with someone else's,

84
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:10,566
and debate the plans of others,
the philosophies of others,

85
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:13,200
the achievement styles of others,

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,433
the way others appreciate themselves.

87
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,466
Debate all this.

88
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:20,065
Why? Because it affects everything.

89
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:22,266
The value you place on your plan,

90
00:04:22,266 --> 00:04:25,266
the value you place on yourself,

91
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:29,733
the value you place on life in 
general affects everything around you.

92
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,866
It even affects how you respect time.

93
00:04:32,866 --> 00:04:36,033
The 24 hours a day given
to each of us to do with

94
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:37,200
as we please.

95
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,666
There's a connection between
appreciating yourself

96
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:45,100
and appreciating and respecting time.

97
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,500
People who appreciate
themselves understand

98
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,766
and respect the use of time.

99
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:54,233
Here's what I call the best
kept secret of the rich.

100
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:58,166
Interesting discovery that I made one day.

101
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,000
I couldn't believe it

102
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,033
when I found out that rich
people have about 24 hours a day

103
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:09,533
and poor people have about 24 hours a day.

104
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,400
Wouldn't that drive you
mad until you found out

105
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,733
what the difference was?

106
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:19,466
I'm telling you the difference
is in the management of the time.

107
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,666
A few simple disciplines
practiced every day

108
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,033
and your whole life can change.

109
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,766
Your future can change.
Your income can change.

110
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,966
You can learn from negative
as well as positive.

111
00:05:35,966 --> 00:05:37,266
The Bible is such a great book

112
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,366
because it is a collection
of human stories

113
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:41,033
on both sides of the ledger.

114
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:44,700
One list of human stories
is called examples.

115
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,500
Do what these people did.

116
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,533
And the other list of human
stories is called warnings.

117
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,266
Don't do what these clods did.

118
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:57,000
What a wealth of information,
what to do and what not to do.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,366
I think it also means however

120
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:01,666
that if your story ever
gets in somebody's book,

121
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:05,733
make sure they use it as
an example, not a warning.

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,966
All the successful people
I know and work with

123
00:06:08,966 --> 00:06:11,466
around the world are good readers.

124
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:13,133
They just read, read, read.

125
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:16,433
They are so curious that
they are driven to read

126
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,000
because they just have to know.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It is one of the things
they all have in common.

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,500
Here's a good phrase.

129
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,233
All leaders are readers.

130
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,100
And they use cassette programs too,

131
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,866
especially while they're in
the car or during other times

132
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,600
when they can't read.

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,066
Cassettes can help all of
us easily pick up new ideas

134
00:06:36,066 --> 00:06:37,833
and new skills.

135
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,100
Did you know there are cassettes and books

136
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,100
on how to be stronger, more
decisive, a better speaker,

137
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,866
a more effective leader,

138
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:48,966
have a better effect on other
people, become more loving,

139
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:52,400
develop personality, get
rich, develop influence,

140
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,233
become sophisticated and
people don't use them?

141
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,400
How would you explain that?

142
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,533
Did you know that hundreds
of successful people

143
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:03,033
have written their stories in books

144
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:05,966
and told how they did it
on cassettes like this,

145
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:07,966
and people don't want to listen?

146
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:09,433
How would you explain that?

147
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,533
The guy's busy, I guess.

148
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,366
He says, "Well, yeah,

149
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:16,633
"if you worked where I work,
by the time you struggle home,

150
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:17,866
"it's late."

151
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:19,233
You've got to have a bite to eat,

152
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,766
watch a little TV and get to bed.

153
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:25,133
You can't stay up half the
night and read, read, read.

154
00:07:26,033 --> 00:07:29,000
And this is the guy that's
behind on his bills.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,566
He's a good worker, hard worker, sincere.

156
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:36,766
But remember, you can be sincere
and work hard all your life

157
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:40,333
and wind up broke,
confused, and embarrassed.

158
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,366
You've got to be better
than a good worker.

159
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:46,266
You've got to be a good
reader, a good listener.

160
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,633
At least you could hear a good
cassette on the way home, right?

161
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,300
Now, you don't have to read

162
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,266
or listen to educational
cassettes half the night.

163
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,133
Although if you're broke,
it's a good place to start.

164
00:07:58,133 --> 00:08:01,266
But here is all I ask,
just 30 minutes a day.

165
00:08:01,266 --> 00:08:04,000
That's all, stretch it
to an hour if you can.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,666
But at least 30 minutes.

167
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,600
Hear or read something challenging,

168
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:11,033
something instructional
at least 30 minutes a day.

169
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,266
And here's the next key.

170
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,733
Every day, don't miss.

171
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,433
Miss a meal, but not your 30 minutes.

172
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,433
Hey, you can get along without some meals,

173
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,133
but you can't get along
without some ideas,

174
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,866
examples and inspiration.

175
00:08:25,133 --> 00:08:26,533
There's a Bible phrase that says

176
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:30,700
humans cannot live on
bread alone or food alone.

177
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,133
It says the next most important
thing to bread is words.

178
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:38,966
Words nourish the mind,
words nourish the soul.

179
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:41,866
Humans have to have food
and words to be healthy

180
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:43,433
and prosperous.

181
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:46,800
Make sure you have a good
diet of words every day.

182
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,233
I told my staff one day
some people read so little

183
00:08:49,233 --> 00:08:50,900
they have rickets of the mind.

184
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:54,100
And also remember to
properly feed the mind.

185
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,233
You must have good balance.

186
00:08:56,233 --> 00:08:58,933
Don't just read or
listen to the easy stuff.

187
00:08:58,933 --> 00:09:01,000
You can't live on mental candy.

188
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,066
Here's a thought,

189
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:07,433
why not call good books and
cassettes tapping the treasure

190
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:08,800
of ideas?

191
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,966
That's it.

192
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,166
Tapping the treasure of ideas

193
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,500
like you're doing with this program.

194
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,966
And if somebody's got a good excuse

195
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,133
for not tapping the treasure of ideas

196
00:09:18,133 --> 00:09:20,600
for at least 30 minutes every day,

197
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,733
or spending the money and
getting the books and cassettes,

198
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:24,900
I'd like to hear it.

199
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,933
Invest the money, 
get the cassettes and books.

200
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,900
The best money you can spend

201
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,600
is money invested in your self-education.

202
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:36,233
Don't shortchange yourself

203
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:39,033
when it comes to investing
in your own better future.

204
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:42,100
Mr. Shoaff got me started on my library

205
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,166
when I first met him.

206
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,100
He said to me, "Become self-educated.”

207
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,033
"Standard education will
get you standard results."

208
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,400
Check those numbers and see
if that's what you want.

209
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,433
And if it isn't, if you want
something better than standard,

210
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,366
you must become self-educated.

211
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,133
So, I went to work on my library

212
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:04,000
and I now have one of the best.

213
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,300
Shoaff recommended a couple
of books in particular

214
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,033
to get me started.

215
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:11,866
Now, I had a Bible, that's 66 books.

216
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,366
So, that was a pretty good start.

217
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:16,133
And my parents saw to it
that I had a good study

218
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:17,633
of the Bible.

219
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,600
But the first book Mr.
Shoaff told me to get

220
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,166
was the book Think and
Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.

221
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,666
If you don't already have it,

222
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,800
it's a great one to add to your library.

223
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,333
Earl Nightingale has put it on cassette.

224
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,233
The title should intrigue you.

225
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,900
Think and Grow Rich.

226
00:10:35,766 --> 00:10:38,566
I read it several dozen times.

227
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:41,733
Shoaff said repetition
is the mother of skill.

228
00:10:41,733 --> 00:10:44,600
And if you could have seen
my bank account at the time,

229
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,466
you would have known

230
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:48,066
I needed lots of that kind of repetition.

231
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,500
Some of the ideas in that book 
made major changes in my life.

232
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,233
As I look back now,

233
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:58,733
the book was worth thousands
and I bought it for pennies.

234
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,966
I learned a very valuable lesson.

235
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:04,000
There can be a great deal
of difference between cost

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,833
and value.

237
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,066
Before I met Mr. Shoaff, I used to ask,

238
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:10,166
how much does it cost?

239
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,633
After I met him however,

240
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:14,900
I soon learned to ask,
how much is it worth?

241
00:11:15,933 --> 00:11:19,900
I started basing my life
on worth instead of cost

242
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,433
and everything changed.

243
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,766
The next book he recommended
I get was a book on nutrition.

244
00:11:29,766 --> 00:11:32,366
Shoaff said study nutrition,

245
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:36,366
vitality plays an important
part in doing well.

246
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:39,866
Some people don't do well
because they don't feel well.

247
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,100
It's not that they're not intelligent.

248
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,066
It's that they're ill.

249
00:11:44,066 --> 00:11:47,900
They don't have the fire
and the vitality to do well.

250
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,000
So, he really got on me about nutrition.

251
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,366
Now, some of those health
books are a bit weird,

252
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:55,433
but you can separate out the weird stuff.

253
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:58,400
There are cassettes on nutrition too.

254
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,933
Remember, don't be a
follower, be a student.

255
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:05,366
Someone says, I read this
book. Should I follow?

256
00:12:05,366 --> 00:12:07,333
And the answer is no.

257
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,500
Read at least two books
and make up your own mind.

258
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,066
Don't be a follower, be a student.

259
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,600
So, take care of yourself.

260
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,666
There's a Bible phrase that says

261
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,800
many times the spirit is
willing but the body is weak.

262
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,066
So, you have to work on both.

263
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:24,966
You wake up in the
morning and the mind says,

264
00:12:24,966 --> 00:12:26,533
"Let's go get them."

265
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:30,066
And the body says, "I
can't even get out of bed."

266
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:31,266
So, work on your health.

267
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,533
A person's library of books and cassettes

268
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:38,200
reveals his or her most dominant desire.

269
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,166
It's interesting to walk
into someone's house

270
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,800
and browse through the library.

271
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,633
What does your library say about you?

272
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,466
So, read all the books.

273
00:12:48,466 --> 00:12:49,633
Now, here's good news.

274
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:51,633
You don't have to read them all at once.

275
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:57,300
Try this. Two books a week, in
10 years is a thousand books.

276
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,666
If you read a thousand
books in the next 10 years,

277
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,666
do you think they would greatly influence

278
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:05,166
all the dimensions of your life?

279
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,266
The answer is, of course.

280
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:09,533
Well, here's what's exciting.

281
00:13:09,533 --> 00:13:11,400
It's only two books a week.

282
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,800
However, I would suggest
if you haven't read

283
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,333
two books a week for the last 10 years,

284
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:20,133
you are about a thousand books behind.

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,033
Can you imagine the incredible
disadvantage it will be

286
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:27,366
10 years from now to
stride into the marketplace

287
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,133
a thousand books behind?

288
00:13:30,733 --> 00:13:33,600
For some confrontations,
you won't be a match.

289
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,766
And for some opportunities,

290
00:13:34,766 --> 00:13:37,000
your knowledge will be too lacking.

291
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,800
For some values, your
philosophy will be too shallow.

292
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,900
Missing skills, missing
knowledge, missing insights,

293
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,166
missing values, missing lifestyle.

294
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,666
It could happen if you
don't read the books.

295
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:53,900
Remember, the book you
don't read won't help.

296
00:13:54,966 --> 00:14:00,866
Let me give you three ways to 
find out how to change anything,

297
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,100
any life direction, any dimension.

298
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,766
Here's three ways to find
out how to change anything.

299
00:14:07,766 --> 00:14:12,233
Number one is to read.
Become a good reader.

300
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,966
All of the successful
people I know and work with

301
00:14:15,966 --> 00:14:18,133
around the world,
they're all good readers.

302
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:20,900
Curiosity drives them to
read, they got to know.

303
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,533
They just read, read, read,
read, read, read, read, read, read.

304
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,066
Become a good reader.

305
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:29,933
Now, that's my opinion.

306
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:32,500
Listen to the other
lecturers and listen to me

307
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,766
and make up your own mind.

308
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:37,666
Don't be a follower. Be a student, okay?

309
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,300
I say, really for life
change, you got to read.

310
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,566
One way to learn is from
your own experiences.

311
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:48,133
But another way to learn is
from other people's experiences.

312
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:54,366
See, one book might save
you five years if you read.

313
00:14:57,366 --> 00:14:59,800
Did you know there's books
on how to be stronger,

314
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,633
more decisive, be a speaker, be a leader,

315
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:04,166
have a better effect on other people,

316
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,466
develop your personality?

317
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:07,233
Did you know there's books on that?

318
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,566
And people don't read them.

319
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,766
How would you explain that?

320
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,266
And they can read.

321
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Did you know that hundreds
of successful people

322
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,966
have written their stories in books

323
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:24,633
and they wrote down how they did it

324
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,200
and people don't read it?

325
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,566
How would you explain that?

326
00:15:31,533 --> 00:15:36,300
The guy's busy, I guess. You know, 
you get tied up.

327
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:39,700
The guy says, "Well, yeah,
you work where I work.

328
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,800
"By the time you struggle
home, it's late."

329
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,933
You got to eat by 
the supper, watch a little TV,

330
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:44,900
get to bed.

331
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,300
You can't sit up half the night,

332
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,400
reading, reading, reading, reading.

333
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,366
And the guy's behind on his car payment.

334
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:59,166
Good worker, hard worker, sincere,

335
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:03,866
but you got to be better
than sincere and work hard.

336
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,233
Otherwise at the end of your life,

337
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,666
you'll wind up cold stony broke.

338
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,966
You got to be better than a good worker,

339
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:12,433
you got to be a good reader.

340
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,000
Get around successful people and listen.

341
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,566
Now, you can also learn
from unsuccessful people.

342
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,433
Take notes on both, negative and positive.

343
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:31,233
On the negative, the notes
are called what not to do.

344
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,766
And you got to learn what not
to do as well as what to do.

345
00:16:34,766 --> 00:16:37,100
So, learn from the negative
as well as the positive.

346
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:43,133
Okay? Find out what poor
people read and don't read it.

347
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,000
That's good information.
Learn from the negative.

348
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:52,433
But now you can also
learn from the positive.

349
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,700
Get around successful people,
listen to what they say,

350
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,366
listen to how they say it.

351
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,300
It's important.

352
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:02,566
We've all got about 16 waking hours.

353
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,500
Practice listening those 16 hours.

354
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,400
And I say practice listening
because listening isn't easy.

355
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,266
I found out it's easier to
talk than it is to listen.

356
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,200
But if you will practice listening

357
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,366
the 16 hours you're awake,

358
00:17:17,366 --> 00:17:20,600
sure enough from surprising
sources, comes great ideas.

359
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,900
In sales training, we teach.

360
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,566
If you wanna learn sales,
listen to the kids.

361
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:30,833
Kids have got to be the master
salespeople of all time.

362
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:32,833
They have no equal.

363
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,433
Father tells his young son,

364
00:17:35,433 --> 00:17:37,300
"No, you cannot have an ice cream cone."

365
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,333
30 minutes later, he's licking on one.

366
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,266
That'd be 30 minutes worth listening to,

367
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,333
they got moves you wouldn't believe.

368
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,200
Persistence runs deep like the ocean,

369
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,466
and the kids never took a class

370
00:17:51,466 --> 00:17:53,200
on how to overcome objections.

371
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:57,233
They already know how,
they don't need classes.

372
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,733
You tell kids no and
they turn right on by.

373
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:02,866
They give you three good reasons.

374
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:04,400
You just say, no. It goes right on by.

375
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,233
They give you three more. They're masters.

376
00:18:08,766 --> 00:18:10,166
So, listen and learn.

377
00:18:11,266 --> 00:18:12,866
Now, here's some of the
best advice I've got

378
00:18:12,866 --> 00:18:13,733
for the whole evening.

379
00:18:13,733 --> 00:18:16,966
It won't get any better
than this. This is it.

380
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:22,500
Poor people ought to take
rich people out to dinner

381
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,333
and listen.

382
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:27,733
That's some of the best I got.

383
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,466
If a guy's not doing well,

384
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:33,900
one of the first things he ought to do

385
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,600
is find a guy that is doing well

386
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,066
and offer to buy him his dinner,

387
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:40,733
spend 50, 60, 80, 100 dollars.

388
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,666
Go for the full nine course.

389
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,833
Start him on the juices and hors d'oeuvre 

390
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,733
Get him started talking.
The salad takes 15 minutes.

391
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:52,266
Keep it rolling. Biggest
steak in town takes 45.

392
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:54,666
Keep it rolling. Pour on the dessert.

393
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,833
Stretch that meal out about two hours.

394
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,900
If you get a successful person to eat

395
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,266
and talk for two hours,

396
00:19:00,266 --> 00:19:03,166
they're liable to drop ideas
in your lap change your life.

397
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:06,666
Multiply your income by
two by three by five.

398
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,400
But you're right.

399
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,500
Poor people don't usually take
rich people out to dinner.

400
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,533
That's the problem.

401
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,166
The guy said he's rich,
let him buy his own dinner.

402
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,133
I'm not coming up with any money.

403
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,366
And he says, besides
you work where I work,

404
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:29,966
by the time you struggle home, it's late.

405
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:31,433
You're lucky to get your own supper.

406
00:19:31,433 --> 00:19:34,400
Let alone running around trying
to find a rich man to feed.

407
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:39,266
And the guy's behind on his house payment.

408
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:45,266
Good worker, hard worker, sincere.

409
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,866
But you got to be better
than sincere, work hard.

410
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:52,266
You wind up broke. You got to
be better than a good worker.

411
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,266
You got to be a good listener.

412
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:57,333
And remember, what you
read and what you hear

413
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,733
put the good stuff in your journal.

414
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:04,600
Now, here's the third way to find out

415
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,800
how to change your life,

416
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,133
and that's to observe.

417
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,433
You can pick up a lot of
ideas just by watching.

418
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:14,900
Get around successful people and watch.

419
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:20,700
Here's why, success leaves clues.

420
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,766
Watch how the man shakes hands.

421
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,900
Watch how the lady responds.

422
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,966
People who do well do
certain things over and over

423
00:20:30,966 --> 00:20:32,433
and over and over.

424
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:35,700
And if you're clever,
you can pick them up.

425
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,566
Watch it all.

426
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,666
If a guy's making $10,000 a month,

427
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:42,266
I'd watch how he walks. Maybe that's it.

428
00:20:42,266 --> 00:20:44,166
Copy his funny little walk.

429
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:46,933
Somebody says, "Well,
that's kind of a silly walk.

430
00:20:46,933 --> 00:20:48,833
"It's 10,000."

431
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,566
I haven't got the money
yet, but I got the walk.

432
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:57,400
It's bound to start somewhere.

433
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:00,400
What I ask you tonight is to be unusual

434
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,900
and be a good observer of what's going on.

435
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,633
You can pick up ideas
that can change your life

436
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:05,833
starting tomorrow.

437
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,600
Just be a more careful observer.

438
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,566
Now, remember, there's two ways to see.

439
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,300
One is called sight. See with your eyes.

440
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:20,766
The other one is called
insight. See you with your mind.

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,800
See with your eyes, you'll see things.

442
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,966
See with your mind, you'll see answers.

443
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,133
Put your eyes and your mind to work.

444
00:21:33,866 --> 00:21:36,033
And the best advice on
developing sight and insight

445
00:21:36,033 --> 00:21:39,133
is pay attention.

446
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,533
Don't miss anything.

447
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,200
In the weekend seminar we teach,

448
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,233
one of the greatest fatalities
to success is preoccupation.

449
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:51,166
Lack of concentration.

450
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:56,000
The guy's mind wanders.

451
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:59,166
See, you wind up average.

452
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,666
You've got to learn to
zero in and concentrate.

453
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,033
I read a good article one
time, Reader's Digest.

454
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:08,700
The title was, Wherever You Are, Be There.

455
00:22:09,766 --> 00:22:12,600
Excellent. Don't miss anything.
