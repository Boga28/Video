1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,550
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish and today

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,757
I have such a fun lesson for you. We're going to compare English

3
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:12,678
from different parts of the world, South African English,

4
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:16,702
American English and of course Australian English.

5
00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:20,568
And specifically, we'll get to hear the range of vocabulary

6
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:24,041
or the different words that we use for really simple

7
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:28,232
everyday objects. We all speak English as our native language

8
00:00:28,232 --> 00:00:32,991
but I think you'll be really surprised by just how different

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,000
some of the words that we use really are.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,926
Some similarities, some really different.

11
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:44,900
And I will be joined by two amazing, very special guests,

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,959
both making their Youtube debut so make sure you give them

13
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:51,196
a little bit of love down in the comments.

14
00:00:51,416 --> 00:00:56,388
Both of my guests are language coaches from inside Hey Lady!

15
00:00:56,388 --> 00:01:00,196
and you may know Hey Lady! is my online community where

16
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:03,906
women meet, make friends and practise speaking English

17
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:07,771
together. It really is the perfect place for women to build

18
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:11,881
confidence and fluency with their English. It's a space to get

19
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:15,615
speaking practice, the speaking practice that you need to take

20
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:18,870
your conversation skills up to the next level.

21
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:22,306
Now of course, there is a link to find out more down in the

22
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:24,811
description and I might pop one up there too.

23
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,862
Ask me any questions you have down in the comments

24
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:30,888
but right now let's meet these guests.

25
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:36,456
Hi there! My name is Jasmine. I'm from the United States,

26
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:41,400
more specifically the southeastern part of the United States

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,397
which we call The South. So I love being a part of

28
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:49,874
the Hey Lady! community and I'm very excited to get started

29
00:01:49,874 --> 00:01:52,109
with this pronunciation

30
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,569
comparison between the different Englishes.

31
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,430
Hey everyone, I'm Dani. I'm one of the language coaches from

32
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,905
Hey Lady! If you haven't heard about it yet, it is an amazing online

33
00:02:04,905 --> 00:02:07,899
platform empowering women through English

34
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,532
from all over the world.

35
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,437
Our coaching team is from all over the world

36
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:14,983
and I'm from Cape Town in South Africa

37
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:17,561
so I'm really looking forward to this today.

38
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:20,241
Thanks Em for the invite. This is gonna be fun.

39
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:24,996
So in this video, you have a South African, an American and

40
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:28,942
an Australian to listen to. Keep in mind that each of us

41
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:33,642
represent just one voice, one accent from each of our countries.

42
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:38,062
So let's compare some of the differences and similarities

43
00:02:38,062 --> 00:02:40,269
between these different Englishes.

44
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:45,778
Okey-dokey so this first one is a traffic light.

45
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:50,075
Look at the one you started off with. The most confusing word

46
00:02:50,075 --> 00:02:54,761
when anybody comes to South Africa is this. Yes it's a traffic light

47
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:57,759
but in South Africa, we call it a robot.

48
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:02,959
Wow, a robot? If I was in South Africa,

49
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,333
I would hear that and be completely confused.

50
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,304
How cool. Confusing?

51
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,007
Interesting.

52
00:03:12,007 --> 00:03:19,378
So the next one is a sidewalk, the part where pedestrians

53
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:25,907
walk which makes sense actually. It's beside where you walk.

54
00:03:25,907 --> 00:03:29,726
In South Africa, we call this a pavement. What's it in Australia?

55
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:35,879
That's interesting. Pavement, I think is what it's referred to as in

56
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,218
the UK as well, I think as we go through this video,

57
00:03:40,218 --> 00:03:44,882
we'll pick up that there's a connection between British English

58
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:47,404
and Australian English and British English

59
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:52,237
and South African English but interestingly there're different

60
00:03:52,237 --> 00:03:56,895
similarities. In Australia, we say footpath

61
00:03:56,895 --> 00:04:00,197
and if you compare all of them, they're all quite logical.

62
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:05,346
American sidewalk, Australian footpath and

63
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,181
South African pavement.

64
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,300
Pavement for us is probably more the

65
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,943
the surface, the material rather than

66
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:17,283
the space or the place where you walk beside the road.

67
00:04:17,283 --> 00:04:23,899
This is a roundabout. They are super uncommon where I'm from.

68
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:26,960
One got installed in my hometown

69
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,746
maybe a few years ago and you can just see people coming up

70
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:34,084
on it and they're kind of like.

71
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:39,768
Okay so this one over here we call a traffic circle.

72
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:43,374
I know that we get laughed at because it's a circle

73
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:45,860
in the middle of an intersection so we call it a circle.

74
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,400
You go around the traffic circle

75
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,382
or over the traffic circle.

76
00:04:50,382 --> 00:04:52,978
We call it a roundabout in Australia.

77
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:57,143
They're very common in Australia, we have lots of roundabouts

78
00:04:57,143 --> 00:05:00,300
so we're very comfortable going over them.

79
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,702
Dani was talking about the prepositions that are used together

80
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:10,609
with the noun and I think when she said traffic circle she said

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,445
"We go around the circle" or "over the circle"

82
00:05:14,445 --> 00:05:20,333
and it sounds a little odd to me to say around the roundabout.

83
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,013
We wouldn't say that even though that makes the most sense,

84
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:28,110
we would say through or over the roundabout and

85
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,002
interestingly, when Jasmine was talking about approaching

86
00:05:32,002 --> 00:05:35,824
the roundabout, she was saying people come up on

87
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:39,103
the roundabout and that sounds strange to me.

88
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:42,529
We would always say come up to the roundabout

89
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:45,654
so even the way that we use prepositions

90
00:05:45,654 --> 00:05:48,419
around these different nouns

91
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,907
is a little different.

92
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:54,881
So the thing that you touch at the centre of the steering wheel

93
00:05:54,881 --> 00:05:58,850
is called your horn so you. 

94
00:05:59,042 --> 00:06:03,970
I guess you say you blow your horn, that can't be right.

95
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,978
You touched the horn? Yeah I guess you'd touch the horn.

96
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,848
Usually we might say someone is leaning on the horn

97
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,469
which means they use it too much,

98
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:18,000
the sound that we use is the beep beep.

99
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,760
Boop boop. That's a hooter.

100
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,337
Dani's saying boop boop.

101
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,198
Jasmine's saying beep beep and again the words that we're using

102
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:33,917
with these nouns are a little different so Jasmine was saying

103
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:37,300
"leaning on the horn" means that someone is like

104
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,947
using it too much.

105
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:44,874
We use the noun horn here in Australia too but we use honk

106
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,053
which is a really strange verb, honk the horn.

107
00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:56,359
So the liquid that you put in your car is called gas.

108
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,264
I've seen a video where someone was commenting that it's so silly

109
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:05,597
that Americans call it gas because it's a liquid.

110
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:11,129
We are well aware that it is a liquid but it is short for gasoline.

111
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,715
So we fill up our cars in South Africa with petrol. We say petrol

112
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:17,152
and we go to the petrol station.

113
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,516
Same here Dani. In Australia, we fill up our cars with petrol

114
00:07:22,516 --> 00:07:27,944
and yes we call it a petrol station or a service station

115
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:31,823
and if any of you have watched any of my videos about

116
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:35,582
Australian slang, you'll know that it is more common

117
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:38,778
to use a short version of service station.

118
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:40,126
Can you remember?

119
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,071
Servo. That's right.

120
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:46,751
We go to the servo to fill up with petrol.

121
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,907
But you'll also hear fuel

122
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,441
being used as well like a fuel station. I need to get some fuel.

123
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:59,056
What we put on our lips to make them moisturised,

124
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:02,820
not for you know beauty, not to give them colour

125
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,360
but to moisturise them, I would say

126
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,415
we either call them lip balm, kind of a hard word to say

127
00:08:12,415 --> 00:08:14,960
but I think this is also

128
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,125
kind of a case where people use the brand name,

129
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,702
a very popular brand name to refer to everything

130
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:26,790
so people might say Chapstick which is a brand name

131
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,045
to refer to every kind of lip balm, regardless of it if it's 

132
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,950
a Chapstick brand or not.

133
00:08:34,142 --> 00:08:39,491
This is lip ice and I think we also refer to it these days as lip balm.

134
00:08:39,683 --> 00:08:45,084
I know it's also lip gloss although lip gloss is more the shiny one.

135
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,991
Lip ice is new to me Dani. I've never heard that before but

136
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:53,134
it makes a lot of sense, lip ice,

137
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,524
like it soothes, it cools your lips. Jasmine was talking about

138
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:02,427
Chapstick as being a brand name and that often happens where

139
00:09:02,427 --> 00:09:07,105
maybe the noun or even the verb that we use is

140
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:10,489
synonymous with a brand name.

141
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:14,318
We had Chapsticks in Australia as well but it never really became

142
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:18,308
you would only refer to a chapstick as chapstick

143
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,429
and you would say lip balm.

144
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:23,510
The other thing I picked up there was Jasmine's

145
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,426
pronunciation of balm. We would say balm

146
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:33,933
with a silent L. So a lot like almond, we say almond and balm

147
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:39,656
and I think in some American accents that L sound is pronounced,

148
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:44,118
it's a little trickier but it's definitely heard, it's not silent.

149
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:48,480
All right so this one is the cause of

150
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,756
much frustration in the United States because what we call

151
00:09:53,756 --> 00:09:57,360
these assorted beverages

152
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,439
is very, it varies depending on what region you are from

153
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:06,769
in the United States and certain regions feel very strongly

154
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,181
that their region is the only way that you should refer to them.

155
00:10:10,181 --> 00:10:15,717
So for me personally I would call all of these things sodas.

156
00:10:15,717 --> 00:10:23,845
So a soda is something sweet, it's fizzy and it comes in a can

157
00:10:23,845 --> 00:10:28,868
or a bottle. It can have multiple flavours like Coke or Sprite or

158
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:34,518
orange soda or grape soda. In general, they're called sodas.

159
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:38,421
In the midwest, they call these things pop.

160
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:42,368
So pop, soda pop or just pop.

161
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:45,151
I guess if you are going out

162
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:49,322
you might even hear these things called fountain drinks,

163
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,505
you know, the kind of machine that gives you the the drink,

164
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:58,256
it's sometimes called a fountain so these are fountain drinks

165
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,782
so you might see that on a menu.

166
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:03,539
You probably wouldn't hear someone say it.

167
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,932
My vote is to say that soda is the most common

168
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:10,244
for the United States. 

169
00:11:10,244 --> 00:11:15,576
Oh my gosh, I had no idea that there was such an array of

170
00:11:15,576 --> 00:11:19,115
different words for these drinks. They're so common

171
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:22,176
and yet they're referred to so differently.

172
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:24,640
I wonder what Dani's got to say about it.

173
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:31,477
These are fizzy drinks in South Africa. Fizzy drinks are

174
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:33,893
Coke and Fanta and Sprite.

175
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:39,014
The plain water with bubbles is just soda, soda water.

176
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:43,043
Soda's plain water with bubbles and all the different flavours

177
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:44,592
are fizzy drinks.

178
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:48,112
That is exactly the same as Australia, Dani.

179
00:11:48,112 --> 00:11:52,540
We call all of the flavoured drinks with bubbles,

180
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,235
we call them fizzy drinks

181
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:58,000
and soda definitely refers to

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,011
water with bubbles in it. Carbonated water.

183
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:08,160
This is a barbecue, so barbecue can be the noun as in

184
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,800
we're having a barbecue which might mean we're having a party

185
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,469
where we will grill foods on the barbecue. And it's also a verb

186
00:12:19,469 --> 00:12:24,584
so we barbecued last night but that's what we call it.

187
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:29,908
This is the most South African thing and word, it's called a braai.

188
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:35,889
It's not a barbecue, it's very different. Braai is to cook over

189
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,940
an open flame but it's not just the fire to cook,

190
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,237
the fire is a whole day event, it's a whole ritual.

191
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:48,382
Of course in Australia, we'd like to rival that and say barbecue

192
00:12:48,382 --> 00:12:51,502
is definitely our national dish.

193
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:58,815
We certainly call it barbecue but again, Australian slang usually

194
00:12:58,815 --> 00:13:04,255
sees us shorten these words and we use barbecue so often

195
00:13:04,255 --> 00:13:06,634
we are always saying barbie.

196
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,891
We can use that to talk about the event like Jasmine 

197
00:13:09,891 --> 00:13:12,487
was saying, come around to my house for a barbie  

198
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,673
or I'm just gonna put some sausages on the barbie.

199
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:19,725
And these are fries.

200
00:13:19,725 --> 00:13:22,379
Oh hot chips,

201
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,048
not french fries. In South Africa, we call them hot chips.

202
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:29,601
In Australia too. Hot chips in Australia.

203
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:33,641
These little vegetables are called zucchini.

204
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:38,390
In South Africa, we call this vegetable baby marrow 

205
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,557
but it's also known as a courgette.

206
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:42,800
We do not call them courgettes.

207
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,479
And in Australia we are most familiar with zucchini

208
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:51,722
and I think these days more and more people are familiar with

209
00:13:51,722 --> 00:13:55,330
courgette. I'd say maybe ten, twenty years ago,

210
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,934
not many Australians would really know what a courgette is.

211
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,658
I think that's changing now.

212
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:06,480
So first off, in America we would call this specific

213
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,556
leafy green arugula, that's the name for it.

214
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,641
That is rocket.

215
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:20,161
Yeah, that's rocket. This vegetable is that peppery salad leaf.

216
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:24,791
I'm gonna jump in early here and say these are biscuits.

217
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,323
Chocolate chip cookies. They are not biscuits.

218
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:33,520
A biscuit is a delicious

219
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,803
breakfast treat, they're usually savoury, they're fluffy.

220
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:43,401
You cut them open, you can put something like jam in them,

221
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:47,839
you might have like a sandwich, like a biscuit sandwich,

222
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,218
so you might have sausage and egg or bacon in your biscuit

223
00:14:51,218 --> 00:14:56,333
but we're not talking about biscuits. Here we have cookies.

224
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,729
They are sweet, there are lots of different kinds of them.

225
00:14:59,729 --> 00:15:04,187
That is so interesting Jasmine, what you just described to me,

226
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:08,791
I'm picturing in my head what we would call an English muffin.

227
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:13,447
It's savoury, we usually have it at breakfast maybe with eggs.

228
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:17,099
Let's hear what Dani has to say about these biscuits.

229
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:22,924
Okay so these are chocolate chip cookies but we don't actually say

230
00:15:22,924 --> 00:15:26,985
cookies, we say biscuits in South Africa. For some reason

231
00:15:26,985 --> 00:15:30,375
chocolate chip cookies is just the name of a chocolate chip cookie

232
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:33,743
but for all other flavours, it's a biscuit.

233
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,706
That's a good point actually Dani, I think we'd say the same here.

234
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:41,993
What is it about chocolate chip cookie? It like rolls off the tongue

235
00:15:41,993 --> 00:15:47,524
and that style of biscuit is probably sometimes called cookie.

236
00:15:47,826 --> 00:15:52,302
Looks like a frozen treat. We call these popsicles.

237
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,223
These are ice lollies. I know in Australia they say icy poles.

238
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:02,229
I don't know what they say in America.

239
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:08,551
Yeah we say icy poles here in Australia. The ones with the stick

240
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:13,349
on them. The ones that Jasmine was describing, the plastic tube

241
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:19,299
that's full of liquid and frozen, we would call them lick sticks

242
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,236
which has only just dawned on me how funny that is.

243
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:27,428
If they're more for fashion I would say it's a sneaker.

244
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:30,026
If they're more for being athletic

245
00:16:30,026 --> 00:16:33,471
I would say a running shoe or tennis shoe.

246
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,436
What could we say? We call these takkies

247
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:41,355
but we also would call them running shoes.

248
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:45,347
Yeah I guess that's the same here. I haven't heard of takkies before

249
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:47,783
that sounds like South African slang.

250
00:16:48,277 --> 00:16:54,277
Quite cool, I think. We don't really use sneakers very much at all.

251
00:16:54,277 --> 00:17:00,704
We would say runners or trainers, would probably be the most

252
00:17:00,704 --> 00:17:01,516
familiar.

253
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:04,151
This is a flip-flop.

254
00:17:04,563 --> 00:17:08,905
This is not a thong Australia, this is not a thong.

255
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:13,960
A thong is something else. These are flip-flops or slip slaps.

256
00:17:15,415 --> 00:17:20,406
I love slip slaps, that's so cute. We don't use that word here.

257
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:25,581
We use thongs, it's always very funny to the rest of the world

258
00:17:26,104 --> 00:17:31,584
but plural. It's not thong, it's thongs and it's a pair of shoes

259
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,024
that you would wear to the beach.

260
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,196
This article of clothing that you wear in the wintertime

261
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:38,760
is a sweater.

262
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,469
This is a jersey, we call it a jersey in South Africa

263
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:47,337
and it's woolen and big and warm and cozy.

264
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:51,066
Well that's interesting. So we've got three different words.

265
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:55,907
Australians, we call this a jumper so we had sweater, jersey

266
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,719
and jumper.

267
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:04,070
So this has two names, it could either be a trash can,

268
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,014
it could also be a garbage can, either one.

269
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:10,250
This is a dustbin.

270
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:13,786
That's interesting, we call it a rubbish bin,

271
00:18:13,786 --> 00:18:15,735
so we've got a few different names there.

272
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:20,382
So this one also has a lot of variations

273
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,839
depending on where it is,

274
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,482
what region you're in, if it's covered or not.

275
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:32,696
So if this is in the south where I'm from,

276
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:37,886
we are most likely to call this area a porch.

277
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,978
If it is something that wraps around your house,

278
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:44,893
especially if it's in the front of your house, you might call it 

279
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:48,907
a front porch or a wrap-around porch.

280
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:53,280
So the covered area outside of your house

281
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,513
where you can sit and relax is the patio. Out on the patio.

282
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:03,421
Yeah I think patio is reasonably common here in Australia.

283
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:07,984
It's made of timber. And what Jasmine was describing as a

284
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:14,248
wraparound porch or a front porch, we would probably call veranda

285
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:15,923
here in Australia.

286
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:20,286
So this looks like an eraser.

287
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:24,956
This is a silly one, I don't know why we call this a rubber.

288
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:27,251
It's made of rubber.

289
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:31,700
An eraser, we say eraser maybe sometimes

290
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,104
but these are rubbers.

291
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:37,344
You laugh Dani, that's what we call them as well!

292
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:41,981
We call these rubbers, I guess it's a funny name but you rub out

293
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:45,162
your pencil. We use eraser but it

294
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:48,000
seems quite formal, much more

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,857
casual and relaxed and much more common to use rubber.

296
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:54,764
These are markers.

297
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,815
Yep, just markers.

298
00:19:58,584 --> 00:20:00,816
These are khokies.

299
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:05,600
Khokies, that's interesting. I think it's just as interesting as what

300
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,020
we refer to them as. In Australia, they're textas.

301
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:16,976
I would call this a comforter so a comforter is a big fluffy thing

302
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:19,292
that goes on top of your bed.

303
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,100
I'm so glad that you put this one in because it's not a doona.

304
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,244
I know that they say that in Australia,

305
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:30,359
that's a crazy word. It's a duvet.

306
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:36,689
How is duvet any more or less crazy than doona, Dani?

307
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:39,521
It's a doona.

308
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,504
I hope that you enjoyed today's lesson as much as I did

309
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:45,777
and learned something new.

310
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:50,747
Listening to different types of English is always fascinating and it

311
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:54,656
always has this lovely sense of

312
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:59,403
rivalry or competition between which type of English is the right

313
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:03,955
English and I'm very much looking forward to the next video

314
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:06,497
that's coming up on mmmEnglish.

315
00:21:06,497 --> 00:21:10,862
Make sure you subscribe to the channel, you give this video a like

316
00:21:10,862 --> 00:21:14,765
if you enjoyed it and come back and see me in the next lesson.

317
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:15,840
Bye for now!
