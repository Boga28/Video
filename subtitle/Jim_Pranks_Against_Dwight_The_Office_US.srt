1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,099
Dwight: What is this?

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,680
Jim: Happy Holidays, Dwight.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,860
But don't open it till Christmas.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,540
You're so pathetic. How long did this take you?

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,700
3 Hours?

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,340
5 minutes, actually.

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,340
I am a black belt in gift wrapping.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,840
Yeah, no such thing.

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,700
They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid.

10
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,740
[scoffs]

11
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,960
Well, I hope it was worth it,

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,860
'cause I'm gonna take it apart in about 5 minutes.

13
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,800
I think it'll take you a little bit longer than that.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Really?

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,000
If I can skin a mule deer in less than 10 minutes,

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,020
I ought to be to cut my way--

17
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:51,780
[Beep]

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,760
It's kinda blurry.

19
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:01,126
That's better.

20
00:01:07,186 --> 00:01:10,126
Question. What kind of bear is best?

21
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,760
That's a ridiculous question.

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,580
False. Black bear.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,720
Well, that's debatable, there are basically two schools of thought.

24
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,720
Fact, bears eat beets.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,700
Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.

26
00:01:23,877 --> 00:01:28,137
Bears do not-- What is going on!? What are you doing!?

27
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:42,140
Last week, I was in a drug store, I saw these glasses, $4, and it only cost me $7 to create the rest of the ensemble, and that makes a grand total of. [a few beeps later.] $11.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:50,000
Michael: Here's what's gonna happen, I am going to have to fix you, manage you two on a more personal scale.

29
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,820
A-A more micro form of management, Jim, what is that called?

30
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,680
Jim: Micro-gament.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,180
Boom. Yes.

32
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:03,860
Michael: Now, Jim is going to be the client, Dwight, you are going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile, or difficult,

33
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,560
Let's go.

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:14,380
Dwight: Alright, fine. [clears throat] Ring. Bill Buttlicker: Hello? Dwight: Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin paper company.  Oh, that's great, 'cause I need paper.

35
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,620
Excellent, you are in luck, because we are having a limited time offer only on EVERYTHING.

36
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,620
Oh, this is my lucky day!

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,340
Michael: Ask him his name.

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,740
Dwight: What is your name sir?

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,040
I am Bill Buttlicker.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,720
Really? that's your real name? Bill: How dare you!

41
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,580
My family built this country, by the way!?

42
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,680
Michael: be respectful, Dwight, please. Dwight: Yes Michael.

43
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,840
Dwight: You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you.

44
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,600
Jim: [Places bobblehead on table]

45
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,620
Identity theft is not a joke Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!

46
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:47,809
Jim: MICHAEL! Dwight: Oh, that's funny, MICHAEL!

47
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:50,500
Bill: Hold on one second, that's my other line. Dwight: Wha- No- But I-

48
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,660
Bill: [On other line] Hello? [scoffs] oh yeah, I was just on the phone with a STUPID salesman, he's SO dumb.

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,620
Probably just keep him on the line forever and not buy anything. [Long pause.] Okay.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,700
Michael: It's up to you to change his mind.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:11,120
[Click] Bill: Sorry, that was a family emergency. Dwight: Oh no! what's wrong? Bill: You know what? That's private. Michael: Boundaries! Dwight! Come on!

52
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:20,260
Karen: Hey.  Jim: Hey.  Karen: Who are you faxing so early in the morning?  Jim: Oh, um.. Kinda hard to explain.

53
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:34,840
I don't have a TON of contact with the Scranton branch but, before I left, I took a box of Dwight's stationary. So from time to time, I send Dwight faxes, from himself, from the future.

54
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:45,260
"Dwight, at 8:00 A.M today, someone poisons the coffee, do NOT drink the coffee, more instructions will follow, cordially, Future Dwight."

55
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,240
[Stanley walks out with a fresh cup of coffee]

56
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:50,829
[Dwight sprints around the office like a madman]

57
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,980
Dwight: NO!!

58
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,300
*Poor Stanley*

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,740
You'll thank me later.

60
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,880
Dwight: As I was saying, We're having a limited- Bill: You're gonna have to talk a little bit louder, I'm hard of hearing.

61
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,160
Michael: Sorry if he's an old man.

62
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,980
Dwight: Okay, as I was saying, right now-- Bill: Gotta talk louder.

63
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,860
*Louder* Okay, our prices have never been lower. Bill: Son, you have to talk louder.

64
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,080
Dwight: Never been lower! Ne-- Bill: LOUDER, SON!

65
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,240
BUTTLICKER! OUR PRICES HAVE NEVER BEEN LOWER! HE--

66
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,740
*Michael: *Loud Whisper* STOP IT!, STOP IT!

67
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,800
[Short Composure pause]

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,180
[Loud Whisper] That is totally inappropriate.

69
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,039
[Loud Whisper] You never yell at the client. You NEVER yell at the client. Bill: You listen to me sir. Michael: *disappointed* Here we go.

70
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,480
Bill: The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile, and definitely difficult.

71
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,800
*Repeatedly* Dwight: Please Mr. Buttlicker, give me another chance. Bill: I'm irate right now. Michael: *Also repeatedly* Give me the phone.

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Dwight: I have to put you on with my boss. Bill: Well I should hope so.

73
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,760
Bill: Who is this? Michael: Hello, this is Michael Scott, Regional Manager. Bill: Well this is William M. Buttlicker.

74
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:47,600
Hello Mr. Buttlicker, how may we help you? Bill: Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna buy $1,000,000 dollars worth of paper products today.

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,380
Dwight: [Laughs excitedly] Michael: See how it's done?

76
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:58,260
Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it. Dwight: You are the master. Bill: There is one condition, Michael, Michael: Yes. Bill: you have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.

77
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:01,920
Dwight: Don't do it, Michael. Michael: [Whisper] It's a million dollar sale.

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,760
[Pam muttering]

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Dwight: Where is my desk!? [Long pause] Jim: That is weird.

80
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,460
Dwight: This is NOT funny, this is totally unprofessional.

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,140
Jim: Okay well, YOU'RE the one who lost the desk.

82
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,020
Dwight: I didn't lose my desk.

83
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,200
Jim: Okay,  calm down, where was the last place you saw it?

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,260
Dwight: Okay, WHO MOVED MY DESK!?

85
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,080
Jim: I think you should re-trace your steps.

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:33,480
Dwight: Okay, I am going to tell Michael, and this entire office will be PUNISHED! Jim: Colder.

87
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:43,580
Jim: Warmer. little warmer.. there ya'-- ooh.. warmer..

88
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,900
Warmer! Warmer, warmer! Cold ,cold, cold! Back up. [Phone rings] Ooh.

89
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,480
Ooh. Warmer. HOT! RED HOT! HOT! [Fades out] VERY HOT..

90
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,840
*Dwight, just sit down already!*

91
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,300
*Dwight listens*

92
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:18,820
Dwight: Dwight Schrute, Jim: Hi, Dwight, um. What sorta discounts are we giving on the 20-pound white box? Jim: I've given you this information, like 20 times. Jim: I know.

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
[Sorry, can't clarify :|]

94
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
Okay, thank you, gotta get back to work.

95
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,180
Michael: Okay, so Dwight, in your own words, "Someone replaced all my pens and pencils with crayons, I suspect Jim Halpert."

96
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:49,080
"Everyone has called me Dwayne all day, I think Jim Halpert paid them to." Jim: [short chuckle] YES, five bucks each, it was totally worth it.

97
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,900
Jim: You look cute today, Dwight. Dwight: Thanks, girl.

98
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:06,440
So, yesterday, Dwight found half a joint in the parking lot, which is unfortunate because as it turns out, Dwight FINDING drugs is more dangerous than most people USING drugs.

99
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:14,160
Jim: I'm just saying you can't be sure that it wasn't you. Dwight: That's ridiculous, of course it wasn't me. Jim: Marijuana is a memory loss drug, so maybe you just don't remember.

100
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,300
Dwight: I would remember. Jim: well how could you if it just erased your memory?

101
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,040
Dwight: That's not how it works. Jim: Now, how would you know how it works?

102
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,880
Dwight: Knock it off okay? I'm interviewing you! Jim: NO, YOU SAID THAT I'D BE CONDUCTING THE INTERVIEW WHEN I WALKED IN HERE, NOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH POT DID YOU SMOKE!?

103
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,080
Dwight: (Wha- What?)

104
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:37,940
Michael: "This morning I found a bloody glove in my desk drawer and Jim Halpert tried to convince me I commited murder. I think he may be the real murderer."

105
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:44,260
"Jim Halpert said there was an abandoned infant in the women's room, when I went to save the child, I saw Meredith on the can." [DX]

106
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,420
[Michael cringes] Michael: [Deep breath] God.

107
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:58,860
Photographer: Smile. Dwight: No. I Never smile if I can help it. Showing one's teeth is a submission signal in primates, once someone smiles at me, all I see is a chimpanzee begging for its life.

108
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:17,100
Jim: This came out really well. There ya' go. Dwight: [Holds up Tag] This is humongous, I am not a security threat, Jim: Oh. Dwight: and my middle name is "Kurt", not "fart".

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,280
Jim: What did I write?

110
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,680
Michael: "This morning, I knocked myself in the head with the phone." [Looks at Dwight, confused] Jim: [Snickers]

111
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,700
That actually took a while, I had to put more and more nickels into his handset until he got used to the weight, and then, I just. took them all out.

112
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,400
Michael: "Every time I typed my name, it said "diapers"." Jim: Just a simple macro.

113
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:59,900
Jim?(Steve) : Morning Dwight. Dwight: Who are you? Steve: Who am I? I'm Jim, we've been working together for twelve years. Weird joke, Dwight.

114
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,960
Dwight: You're not Jim, Jim's not Asian!

115
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,020
Steve: You seriously never noticed? Hey, hat's off to you for not seeing race.

116
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,080
Dwight: Alright then, Jim. Why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?

117
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,780
Steve: Wellington Systems, sold them 10 cases of 24-pound letter stock.

118
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:26,760
Or were you talking about Creeker Murphy? Because I didn't close that one yet, but I'm hoping I've got a voicemail from Paul Creeker waiting for me.

119
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,140
[Automated Voice] Please enter your password.

120
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,600
*Enters Jim's password*

121
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,180
[Automated Voice] You have one new message. Dwight: How did you know?

122
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,100
Dwight: NO, NO, no, that is sensitive information, only for employees, not outsiders! Steve: Dwight, cut it out, I'm trying to work.

123
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:52,500
You don't work here! You're not Jim! Pam: Jim, I got us that dinner reservation, [?] at 7:30. Steve: Oh, great, can't wait. *Kiss*

124
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,920
Jim's at the dentist this morning, and Steve is an actor friend of ours.

125
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:04,820
I don't know who you are, but you are not Jim. [grabs photo] THIS IS JIM! Steve: (You mean me?)

126
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:13,080
Dwight: Oh-- Oh dea-- Oh, how did-- (I don't know how they pulled that off :/)

127
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,680
Roy: So what's the deal, we have to pay for our own drinks? That's lame. Pam: Come on, it'll be fun, and besides, I'm a roulette expert.

128
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,400
Dwight: Impossible, roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.

129
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,320
Jim: I could always count on winning roulette.

130
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,820
Dwight: Oh really? M-hmm. Jim: Yeah. Dwight: How would you do that?

131
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,580
Jim: Mind control.

132
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:36,300
Dwight: [Laughs] You can't be serious. Jim: [Looks at Dwight with a stoic expression] Dwight: Are you serious?

133
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:44,360
Jim: Ever since I was a little kid, like eight or nine, I could, sorta' control things with my mind. Dwight: I don't believe you, continue.

134
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,960
Jim: [Sighs] It was just little things, you know? Like, I could make something shake, or I could make a marble fall off the counter, you know? Just little things.

135
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,660
[Scoffs]

136
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:07,960
Dwight: That's ridiculous, you know what? Uh- Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me everyone, attention in the office please! Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers. And he needs absolute silence.

137
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,300
Dwight: Go ahead.

138
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,240
Jim: Okay, I'll try.

139
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,240
[Jim exhales]

140
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,580
[The coat rack moves]

141
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
[Pam holds up the prank, wordless.]

142
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,760
[Pam winks]

143
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,520
[Jim concentrates harder]

144
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,600
Dwight: Oh my god.

145
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,100
[Please subscribe to the office, it's an awesome channel, and please subscribe to me as well, I put time, effort, and a little dash of love into this.] (Armyman042705)

146
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
So, yeah. Bye!
