I like have a breakfast with my family

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,800
and we have a big garden.

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:23,600

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,720
that's all.

49
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,840

00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,920
Here are some pictures that show
different places to eat.

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,800
Do you like these different places to eat?
Say why or why not. I'll say that again.

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,440
Do you like these different places
to eat? Say why or why not.

55
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,880
All right? Talk together.

56
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:03,400
Actually, I like this place to
eat because I adore eating.

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,440
with my family. And my son. Yes, yes. Yes.
And then

58
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,120
this picture is good.

59
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:26,160
- And this? 
- Yes. I can see

60
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,080
- this family.
- a happy family, yeah

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,360
eat some food outside.

62
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
- In the park.
-Yeah.

63
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,200
- What do you think about this picture? 
- This is desert

64
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,560
- I think, cook with grill
- Yes.

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,320
to put meat on.
These families, small family.

66
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,640
This is a restaurant, I think.

67
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,520
Maybe. I don't like
this same place because

68
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,440
- very noisy
- Yeah.

69
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,360
- for me. 
- deafened me three times because

70
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,520
the high

71
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,920
noise. Noisy. Yes.

72
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,920
Do you think eating in restaurants
is expensive?

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,280
- Yes.
- Here, yes. Cambridge can be expensive.

74
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,880
Do you think eating
on the beach is fun, Rashid?

75
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,680
Yes, I think. Why? Because

76
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:12,360
I can cook anything in beach
and see them. Yes.

77
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,800
And do you think eating in the park is nice?

78
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,120
- Yes, nice. 
- Why?

79
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:29,680
Because a park has different
plants and many tree and

80
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,840
sometimes quite place.

81
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,640
So, Rashid, which of these places
to eat do you like best?

82
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,320
This is best, I think. Because I can
talk with my family.

83
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,160
Thank you. And Gonca, which of these
places do you like best?

84
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,040
This is best, for me.

85
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

86
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,920
Now, do you prefer eating with
friends or family, Gonca?

87
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:12,680
Both. Why? Different things, I think.

88
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:20,320
Sometimes I want to spend time
with my  family, sometimes with my friends.

89
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,760
And what about you, Rashid? Do you prefer
eating with friends or family?

90
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:33,200
With family. Why? Sometime
I go with my friend

91
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,560
but every time with my family because I

92
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,480
went see my wife and daughters.

93
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,440
Do you prefer eating at home or in
a restaurant, Rashid? At home.

94
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,520
Why? This is, I think, healthy.

95
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,600
And what about you, Gonca? Do you prefer 
eating at home or in a restaurant? Home.

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,040
Why? Because healthy and cheaper.

97
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,080
Thank you. That's the end of the test.
You're welcome. Thank you, too.
