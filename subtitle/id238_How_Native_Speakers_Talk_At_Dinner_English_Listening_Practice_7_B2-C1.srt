1
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:09,560
- Oh my gosh, look at this! - Look at that! 
I'm proud of that. - You should be so proud of  

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,920
yourself. - Do you want a bit of cranberry sauce? 
- No, I'm okay. - Do you not have cranberry sauce?  

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,760
I don't eat cranberry sauce. - You need cranberry 
sauce on turkey. - I know. - Oh my goodness,  

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,880
I'm so excited. This is the first... - Laura, I 
like these plates as well because they're quite  

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,120
deep. - Yeah. - They're kind of like, they go like 
in. - They cushion in it all in. I need to, yeah.  

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,360
I'm so excited. Is that good? This is amazing. 
Thank you so much. - Merry Christmas. - Oh yeah,  

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:40,080
Bucks Fizz. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, 
Bucks Fizz. What is Bucks Fizz? - Bucks Fizz is  

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,960
orange juice and champagne, traditionally. But 
I think you can have a cheaper version with  

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,560
Prosecco. - Now you're gonna say prosecco. What 
is the difference between Prosecco and champagne?  

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,720
'Cause I do not know. - Oh, that's good. That's 
a good carrot. Um... - This is amazing. - I think  

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:03,320
Prosecco is just cheaper. I think it's just like 
a, I think Prosecco is like a sparkling wine,  

12
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,680
but I think Champagne... - So the more expensive 
thing, is champagne? - Yeah. - So, what's the  

13
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,760
difference between, so is Champagne a different 
drink? - Champagne is a different thing. Yeah,  

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,880
and Prosecco is just a sparkling wine. I'm going 
to try the turkey. This is the first time I've  

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:21,640
ever cooked turkey in my whole life. - Yeah, I 
know, that's, I'm very excited. - That's good. I'm  

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,840
proud of that. - People don't usually like turkey 
on Christmas Day. Well, people don't usually like  

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,520
turkey, but in the UK, people traditionally have 
turkey on Christmas Day. - Yeah. - But everyone  

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:41,160
complains about it. Do you like, you like turkey, 
don't you? I do enjoy it. - I think when we, when  

19
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,080
we do this again, I think we do need the plate 
warmer because putting the cranberry sauce on my  

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,720
turkey has made it a little bit cold, 'cause the 
cranberry sauce is so cold. - So, well, yeah, but  

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,720
that's the cranberry sauce's fault. - Yeah, but if 
it had heat coming from underneath the plate, see  

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,920
what I mean? It would, like, heat everything up. - 
You just had the cranberry sauce, made everything  

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,600
cold. - Yeah, I don't know, maybe, I don't know, 
maybe my logics don't work. Is your turkey cold or  

24
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,800
is it warm? - Mine’s… Well, I lost a lot of 
heat when I cut it because I cut it a while  

25
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,480
ago. - Maybe we should only rest it for, like, 
10 minutes, then, instead of 20. It's hard, is  

26
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,160
it? It's hard to get it right. - It’s difficult. 
- But this is why it's good to practice. Good to  

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,720
practice, so you know what you do next time. So, 
I think my one thing is, I would probably get  

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,680
the turkey served sooner, but it's still really 
good. I really like it. It's not dry, is it? - No,  

29
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,880
it's lovely. It's really nice. Usually, turkey is 
dry. That's the complaint people have. Yorkshire  

30
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,280
puddings, Laura, this is delicious. Thank you so 
much. I was talking to 'cause, this just 'cause  

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,320
this is a Christmas dinner. I was talking to 
somebody, um, about Christmas, and I said,  

32
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,560
"Oh, Christmas, I'm excited for Christmas." And 
she said, "Oh, of course you are, because you're  

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,760
a man." Oh, she said, "A woman at Christmas, 
they dread it because they've got to do all of  

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,640
the cooking, they've got to do all of the present 
buying, got to do all of the wrapping, all of the  

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,440
decorating." So, she was, I felt a bit awkward 
because I was sat there like “I’m sorry!” What  

36
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,960
do you think? Do you agree? - Oh, traditionally, 
definitely. I've seen, I used to work in a pub,  

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,320
and, um, on Christmas Day, all of the men would 
come in to the pub at about 11:00 to have a  

38
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,920
drink with their friends while the women cooked 
dinner. - Yeah. - Shocking, that. - Yeah, that  

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,400
is bad. - Shocking. - Do you think times will be 
changing? - Well, you're definitely not like that.  

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,920
You're a modern man, you all the way through. When 
I was doing this, you were cleaning up everything,  

41
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
like washing up the dishes as I was going. - 
I appreciate that I can't cook as well, but so  

42
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,880
I'll help in other ways, so I will clean, clean 
everything. - Well, yeah, there's barely anything  

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,120
to wash up now, there's just these two plates 
and that bowl, probably. - And these glasses,  

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:55,320
and that's it. So, yeah. - Pigs in blankets are 
sensational. Pigs in blankets, a little sausage  

45
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,200
wrapped in bacon. - Amazing. - Double meat. - 
Yorkshire puddings. What is Yorkshire pudding,  

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,080
Laura? - Yorkshire pudding is essentially, it's 
this thing here, which just looks like a big flob  

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:13,160
of batter, um, but Yorkshire pudding is so easy. 
It's flour, I did 100 grams of flour, plain flour,  

48
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:22,079
not self-raising. - It’s like a cooking show. - 
Three, three eggs. - Yeah. And then, um, uh, milk,  

49
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,240
semi-skimmed milk, 125 L. Mix it all together, 
mix, mix, mix, mix. Salt and pepper. In the oven  

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,880
for like 20 minutes. Done. So good. And it tastes 
like it's kind of—it's essentially the same recipe  

51
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,720
as pancakes; you just cook it in a different 
way. And it's like a slightly different, um,  

52
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,880
thing. But it's so good… - It’s strange when 
you break it down. When you say what it is,  

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,638
you… - I love Christmas dinner so much. 
- Yeah. I’m wolfing this down, Laura.

54
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:50,600
- Me too. - I am wolfing it down, honestly. 
- And everything is made from scratch,  

55
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,240
isn't that good? - Everything. - This is my 
first ever… - Can you imagine the satisfaction,  

56
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,760
though, if you grew everything? - Oh my 
goodness. That would be really cool. - I’m  

57
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:04,200
not growing a turkey. - No. But my dad, um… - 
He grows veg, doesn’t he? - My dad grows veg,  

58
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,760
so he must have a lot of satisfaction every 
time we have Sunday dinner. Because… - So far,  

59
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,400
I'm really happy with this, I think this 
is really good. - If this is a—so this  

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,398
would be… - This is my first-ever Christmas 
dinner. Is that successful? It’s good, innit?

61
00:05:19,398 --> 00:05:22,972
- So successful, Laura. So successful!

62
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:27,320
- “So successful”. - So Ho, ho, ho. - Ho, ho, 
ho. - So let's talk about the components of a  

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:33,480
Christmas dinner. Traditional Christmas dinner. In 
the UK So. - Okay. No, but I—I think what's good  

64
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:41,000
to do with this—what a Sunday dinner first? Sunday 
dinner. Go on. Sunday— Oh, sorry. I'm—yeah, you're  

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,160
eating! Sunday dinner. Veg. So, something like 
broccoli, cauliflower. You don't like cauliflower?  

66
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:56,440
Broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, peas, carrots. 
Maybe now, people have some things like parsnips.  

67
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:04,360
Mhm. We have parsnips today. Um, what else will 
it be? Peas. - Yeah, essentially, meat, potato,  

68
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,640
and veg and some extras. - And the meat. So people 
have either beef or lamb or chicken. People don't  

69
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:15,520
usually… - Pork. - Pork. But people don't have 
turkey for a Sunday dinner. - No, no. - Then when  

70
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,360
it's Christmas Day… - Turkey comes out. - Things 
come a-changing. - Big boy. Big boy turkey comes  

71
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,000
out. - Turkey is the meat. - Turkey. Got to be. 
Yeah. - And we sprinkle in there some cranberry  

72
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,320
sauce on the turkey. - Oh, amazing. Cranberry 
sauce on the turkey, stuffing. - And then the  

73
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,240
pigs in blankets. - Pigs in blankets is a fun—is a 
Christmas thing, 100%. - You have to. - You can't  

74
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,760
do—no one's doing pigs and blankets in July. Pigs 
and blankets is a Christmas staple. So you have  

75
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,760
your pigs— You have your little sausages 
wrapped in bacon. Parsnips, I think, are  

76
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,760
very Christmass-y. - Are they? - Well. They’re a 
winter veg, aren't they? - So, they're more—you'd  

77
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,720
find them in the winter. - I don't know, um, 
but that's cool. - Yorkshire pudding… - Oh my  

78
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,020
God. - Amazing. And then all doused 
in gravy. And then that's perfect.

79
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:59,000
- Starters at Christmas. Do people have starters 
on Christmas Day? - Some people do. - Did we have  

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,680
a starter? Yeah, we had a starter in the 
restaurant with your dad last year. - Oh,  

81
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,040
yeah. Some people go to a restaurant if 
they don't want the hassle of cooking. Um,  

82
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,960
but I think most people are tired enough 
cooking the dinner that they don't want to  

83
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,840
do a starter as well. - It’s true, and 
it’s loads. - And also, traditionally,  

84
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,520
guess how many calories on average people eat 
on Christmas Day? In the UK? - I saw this. You  

85
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,440
watching it on telly. - How many? - 6,000. - 
6,000. So, if you're eating 6,000 calories,  

86
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,200
you don't need a starter as well. Do you know 
what I mean? You're going to eat enough that  

87
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:31,200
day. - Yeah. - We’re going to be so full. - We’re 
going to be so full. - But then—then we'll also  

88
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,320
have all this turkey left over, so I'll probably 
want a turkey sandwich. - Yeah. Not today. - Yeah,  

89
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:41,800
I don't have any bread today. - Have to go to the 
shop. - But I would on Christmas Day. - This is  

90
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,400
so lovely. This is so lovely. - It’s good, innit? 
Is it a success? - Thank you so much. A massive  

91
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,960
success. - I think so too. I really like it. 
I think it's harder to enjoy it when I've made  

92
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,440
it because this is no worse than any Christmas 
dinner I've ever had, but because I've made it,  

93
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm critiquing it more. - Possibly. Yes. I think 
that when I cook, I enjoy it more because I know  

94
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,120
what all the—like if I make some pasta, um, 
and there's some little chilli flakes in it,  

95
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
and then I get a hint of the chilli, maybe 
you wouldn't notice it, but I do, and I go,  

96
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,760
"Oh yeah, that's the chilli that I put in." So I—I 
think I appreciate it more when I've cooked it,  

97
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:27,600
weirdly. - Yeah, I think I normally do. I think 
with this, because there's, like, so much pressure  

98
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,400
of making Christmas dinner amazing, I think I'm 
a bit more like, "Oh, is it okay?" Every bite,  

99
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,679
I'm going, "Please be okay." - Exactly. - 
And it is, it’s really good? - What’s your  

100
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,079
favourite? Except for, like, obviously, because 
I think a lot of people would say that a Sunday  

101
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,880
dinner is a British person's favourite food, but 
except for that, because that's a bit of a cheat,  

102
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,760
what are the British food is there? - Fish and 
chips? - Fish and chips. But do you like fish  

103
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,480
and chips? - Um, I've gone off it a bit. - I have 
as well. - We were saying this the other day. - I  

104
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,600
have. - I think it's too fatty. - Every time I 
have a bit of chips now, I wish I had something  

105
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,720
else. And that’s… - It’s too much. I think I like 
fish and chips. - I don't know if I do. - If you  

106
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,360
gave me a portion that was like that much fish 
and maybe about eight chips, I think I'd really  

107
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,520
like it. - Yeah, like a mini fish and chips. 
- But there’s always so much of it. - But you  

108
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,160
get—you get, like, 'cause my mom and dad, when 
they order a fish and chips, they get, like,  

109
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,920
a bag. And it sounds strange, but they get a 
bag between, like, three of us or four of us,  

110
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,320
right? - Yeah. - And maybe you might think… - 
Like, one meal between three people? - Yeah.  

111
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,160
But it's not. But it's not, though, is it? One 
bag of chips is loads when you actually open  

112
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,320
it up. It's weird. Maybe people listening 
might think, “A bag of chips?!” It comes in  

113
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,800
a—comes in paper. - Yeah. Traditionally, it came 
in—in newspaper. - Newspaper, yeah. - Um, yeah,  

114
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,320
I think the issue with—I have this terrible thing 
where whatever is put in front of me, I will eat  

115
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,960
the whole amount. I do not know when to stop. I 
am not able to go; ‘that's enough now’. So, if I  

116
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:01,280
have a whole portion… - I’m getting a bit now. - 
Are you getting full now? - A bit. - Berwyn! - I  

117
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,840
will eat it. - You better. Slaved away over 
that all morning. - Go on, carry on. - Um,  

118
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,200
if there's a big portion of fish and chips in 
front of me, I'll finish the whole thing. There's  

119
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,640
no way that I'm going, ‘and I'll just put that 
away,’ like I'll do the whole— And then I end up  

120
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:21,880
feeling awful after I've had fish and chips 'cause 
I overeaten. You know what I mean? - Is that just  

121
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:29,480
fish and chips? - What, that makes me feel ill? - 
Yeah, everything, just overeating? - No, anything  

122
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,920
that's like fried and greasy. - That’s the appeal 
of it, to be honest. I've taught a lot of people  

123
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,640
who have come to Britain, and they want, they 
really want to try fish and chips, and they do.  

124
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:49,600
Everyone who's tried it has said they don't like 
it. Yeah. But they've all gone to London, and I  

125
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,000
think London fish and chips are a different thing. 
- Too posh? - No, no, no, no. I think it's too,  

126
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,320
like, it's just churned out, like it's not like 
the. I bet the chips—oh, that's the air fryer. Um,  

127
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,920
I bet the chips are, like, in a bag frozen for a 
while, and I bet the fish were caught, like, two  

128
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:14,160
weeks ago. Whereas if you go to the fish and chips 
by the sea, yeah, it's fresh, it's all fresh. And  

129
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,400
I can, I can understand that. I can understand if 
the seabreeze is, is hitting your face, and like,  

130
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,520
you can smell the Sea and the salt and the 
sand, having a, having a fish and chips. I can,  

131
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,080
I can understand the appeal of it a little bit. 
It's quite nice, but even then… - I’d only need  

132
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,320
a kids portion. - Yeah, no, I agree, actually. - 
I do think fish and chips is best if you can have  

133
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,960
a kids portion. - Who’s eating all that? - Oh, 
it's loads; it's way too much. - So there's fish  

134
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,600
and chips, there's steak and—well, what would you 
say, a pie in general? - I love a pie. Any kind  

135
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,720
of pie. - Well, I didn't realise that pies are 
British, aren't they? - Well, and other places,  

136
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,720
but yeah, we love a pie here. - Yeah, I thought—I 
thought—somebody said that pie is a British food.  

137
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,560
Like, the pie. - Really? No, surely other… - 
Think about it. - Other people would have been  

138
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,960
doing pies before us. - Would they have? 'Cause 
what's the whole point of a pie? Keeping in things  

139
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,840
inside, fresh and warm. Mining, people going… - 
Are you telling me none of the Nordic countries  

140
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,080
thought of a pie before this? - I’m… - I think it 
was kind of people were coming to that conclusion  

141
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:24,480
around the same time. - I think it was us. - We 
invented the concept of a pie? - Mhm. - Well,  

142
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,880
if we did, go us. Pies are great. Pies are 
so versatile. You have savoury pie… - I  

143
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,160
was teaching somebody, I was teaching somebody and 
they said that, and I believe them. - Well, there  

144
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:41,120
you go. - It sounds—sounds believable. What’s your 
favourite pie? - Chicken, but with not—some pies  

145
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,760
have got a chicken with like a white sauce in it 
and, like, a creamy sauce. I don't like that. I  

146
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:52,680
like it to be. - No. - No, yeah, it's too creamy. 
- Chicken pie… - It needs to be with gravy. With  

147
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,360
gravy. - I do like a chicken pie, but maybe not 
the white sauce. Yeah, yeah, I agree. - Chicken,  

148
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800
stuffing— I haven't made that in a while. I used 
to make that a lot. Do you remember? Chick—I used  

149
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,920
to make a chicken stuffing and potato pie. I'll 
do it soon in the winter. - Could we use the  

150
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,800
turkey? The leftover turkey? - Could do, just 
depends on how much we got left 'cause we might  

151
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:17,360
not have enough to make a substantial pie. - 
Don’t burp. If you weren't on a podcast now,  

152
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:26,240
you'd be burping, wouldn't you? - It’s the bucks 
fizz! - Pie. My favourite pie is Steak and Ale.  

153
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,440
Steak and Ale or steak and kidney, steak and 
kidney pie. My Nan. used to make a lovely steak  

154
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:38,400
and kidney pie. - Kidney?! - It’s kidney. - No, 
it's not. It's kidney bean. - No, no, it's kidney.  

155
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,440
It's kidney. Steak and kidney pie. - I’ve always 
wondered that, and I've always thought it must  

156
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,680
be kidney bean. - No, no no. It’s a kidney. 
It’s like a sheep’s kidney. - Awful. - You’re  

157
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,400
eating a turkey now! You’re eating turkey’s, 
just like, muscles. - Yeah. Nice! Is that what  

158
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,560
meat is? Is it the muscles? - Yes! - Is that 
what it is? - Yes! What is it? What else is  

159
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,880
it? - I don’t know. - Have a think. Would it be 
the bone? No. Would it be the skin? No. Would it  

160
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:11,040
be the… - We do need to heat these plates because 
it’s already cold now. Have you noticed? - No,  

161
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,640
I haven’t noticed, to be honest. - Okay, well 
it’s fine because, yeah… - But, we’ll have a  

162
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:20,720
heat… - We’ll get a plate heater, yeah, we’ll be 
fine… What were we saying? Kidney, no, I think,  

163
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,480
just the idea of it being kidney— I think I’ve 
had a steak and kidney pie, though but I always  

164
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:30,640
thought it was kidney bean! - Well, you must have 
liked it. - No, I'm not a fan of that. - Why would  

165
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:37,240
it be called steak and kidney pie if it was kidney 
bean pie? - Yeah, but the bean probably just took  

166
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,080
too long to say. - No. - I always do this. Do you 
do this? Do you leave your favourite bits till the  

167
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:46,400
end? - No, I go kind of gradually. I kind of leave 
a bit… - The end of my plate will always just have  

168
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,040
parsnips and potatoes on it. - Not just— Oh yeah, 
you don't, you don't. My sister always leaves the  

169
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,120
pigs and blankets. - Yeah, I've got one pigs and 
blanket there I’m ready to have. - One pigs and  

170
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,760
blanket or one pig in blanket? - Well, you never 
say singular, do you? - I’m—I'm tired; you know  

171
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,000
this is hitting me. - You’re going to get the 
Christmas dinner snooze afterwards. - I'm going  

172
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,920
to be comatose. - I love that feeling, though, and 
after you've eaten Christmas dinner and you just  

173
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,880
go into the living room, stick the tele on. - Box 
of celebrations. - Oh, and you just—you just FEG,  

174
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,600
and people go like, should we go for a walk? 
Should we play a game? People like, oh yeah,  

175
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,920
I'll do that in a minute, and everyone just.. 
- Yeah, I know, but it's annoying 'cause you're  

176
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,960
wasting the day there. - I know, but it feels so 
good. - It does; it does. This turkey is so nice,  

177
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,400
though. Well done. - It’s good, isn’t it? - 
Thank you so much. - So, I think what I've  

178
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:46,080
learned from this, I want to give the potatoes 
3 minutes longer, and I want the turkey to be  

179
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:53,520
taken out a bit later. - I’m not listening to 
you; sorry. I was just trying to get pig in  

180
00:15:53,520 --> 00:16:00,520
blanket on my fork. Potatoes later, no earlier! 
- Other than that, I think that's perfect. Then,  

181
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,560
but I’m happy— Yeah, I think that's really good. 
I'm very proud of myself for my first… - You  

182
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,360
should be so proud of yourself. You should be 
so proud of yourself. Would you like, to pull  

183
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:13,280
a cracker? - Now? - Yeah. - Okay, let's do it. - 
Let’s do it. - You always win. - I do. - You know  

184
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,680
what? I think there's been about three years in 
a row where I haven't won. Do you remember we did  

185
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,560
the, um, the live streams last year for Christmas? 
I didn't win a single one. There you go; carry on;  

186
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,680
enjoy. Open it up; what does it say? So inside a 
cracker, usually there's—well, is there always a  

187
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,720
joke? I'd be disappointed if there wasn't a 
joke. And a hat! Put your hat on! - Oh yeah;  

188
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,000
okay; all right; is that the order? You've got 
to do hat then joke? - Yeah, 'cause you’d look a  

189
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
bit silly going like saying the joke… - My prize 
is I've got some stickers. - Great, some lovely,  

190
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,800
yeah. Usually, there's some terrible gift inside, 
like a plastic comb or like a notepad or a little  

191
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,960
jumping frog thing. Um, yeah, I feel a bit, 
I feel a bit… - Quite small, that. - I feel  

192
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,400
a bit ridiculous now. Do you know what 
annoys me as well? - What? - On Christmas  

193
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,359
Day? - What? - Everybody puts on their 
hats and goes, "Oh yeah, lovely, lovely,  

194
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,639
lovely," and then before the meal's even finished, 
people haven't taken them off. I've got mine all  

195
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,160
day. - You went to sleep with yours last year. 
- Yeah, I did last year. Come on; there you go;  

196
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,319
I promise you… - You cannot win a cracker; you 
can have that one, though. There you go. - Yeah,  

197
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,079
yeah, of course. You’re not gonna… - So, you 
ready for the joke? - Oh, I've got some stickers  

198
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:32,560
too. - Okay; what do you call a boastful snowman? 
Um, a boastful snowman; so somebody boastful is  

199
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:39,240
somebody who's proud and like bragging, so… - 
You've got this; come on. - Proud…? - Come on;  

200
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:50,280
what do you call someone who's bragging about 
themselves? - Bigheaded…? - A snow off! - Yeah,  

201
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,240
that's a pretty good one because if you're a 
showoff, you boast about it, but he's a snow off;  

202
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,520
he's an Iceman. - Would you like mine? - An 
Iceman? A snowman. Yes. - Who gets to be in charge  

203
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:10,080
of the pencil case? - Don’t know. - The ruler; 
that's quite a good one. - I like that one. - Um,  

204
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,720
and then sometimes on here; here we go; this 
is a ridiculous one. Some ‘Merry Mindfulness’,  

205
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,000
have you got this as well? - Yeah, I’ve got that 
as well, what does yours say? - “Press pause and  

206
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,200
just Christmas” - Is that what is says? - And 
something to chat about. Oh, here we go; there's  

207
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,680
a question underneath; ah, this is an interesting 
question. If you had to live with one historical  

208
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:34,600
figure forever, who would you choose and why? - 
I think someone like Gandhi would be quite quiet,  

209
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,520
I think he'd probably just stay in his room. 
He’d probably just… - You and Gandhi forever;  

210
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,400
poor Gandhi, he’s come back…. - I’m trying 
to think of someone who wouldn't interfere  

211
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,240
with my life, I feel like he would stay in his 
room; he'd do his meditation, and he wouldn’t…  

212
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,200
He would just chill. - That's what—that's what 
you imagine. But what if—what if—what if he has  

213
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,720
raucous parties? - I don't want someone who's 
going to interfere, so Gandhi or… - What did  

214
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:03,760
you say? - I don't want someone who's going to 
interfere; Gandhi or who else was like… ? Marcel  

215
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:11,640
Marceau. - Who's that? - A mime. - A mime? - 
Yeah, 'cause then he’d just keeps schtum. - I  

216
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:21,440
would say historical figure… what are you doing? 
- There’s more yorkshires. - Laura, I’m getting  

217
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:30,640
full. - Well, I want them. - Alright; okay; um, 
a historical figure I would say for forever is  

218
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:39,120
a different thing, isn't it? - Yeah, that's a 
long time. - A historical figure… Would Gandhi  

219
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:50,600
even speak English? - Yeah, I think so. - Did he 
speak English? - Think so. - Um, someone like—no,  

220
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,920
I was going to say like Julius Caesar, but he'd be 
a nightmare! - Oh God! - He'd be a nightmare; um,  

221
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:09,120
someone like—I don't know, I really don't know. 
Richard—no, not Richard III; I'm having awful  

222
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:16,400
suggestions. - Think of like calmer people. 
- But historical people usually aren't calm;  

223
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,400
they're—they're famous because they did something 
really, really big. - What if I just eat all of  

224
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,800
these? - That would be mental? I mean, if you 
want them, you can have them. Anne Boleyn. - Anne  

225
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:33,320
Boleyn? - Yeah. - She was a bit of a Rebel. - 
Alright; um, Catherine of Aragon. - Yeah. - I  

226
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,440
would have any boys, that's for sure; historical 
joke for you there. What’s the question on yours,  

227
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:47,680
Laura? - It says, if you could build your ideal 
isolation station, what would it look like? Like  

228
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,520
a place where you would isolate? - Right; like a 
man cave, I suppose. - Yeah, or like if you had  

229
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,760
to go and work in a remote location somewhere, you 
had to be isolate. What would you—what would you  

230
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:05,080
put in there? - I took with me to University every 
year; mhm; like back and forth every year, like  

231
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,760
back home for the summer and then to University 
again; like books; like 12 books that I thought,  

232
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,840
yeah, I like the idea of sitting down and just 
reading one of those books. Didn't open them once  

233
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:27,520
in four years. So, no books. - Have you read them 
now? - I have… No, no, I haven't. I would say I’d  

234
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:36,800
just have lots of… like a big TV; I like watching 
films. What about you? - Some kind of like home  

235
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,760
gym? - Oh yeah, that's a good idea. - Cause if 
I was bored I could at least do exercise rather  

236
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,080
than just sitting around; and some Yorkshire 
puddings. - I'm—I'm full, Laura. - You’ve barely  

237
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,280
eaten anything! - What do you mean “barely 
eaten?!” There was a mountain of food;  

238
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:57,480
there was a mountain of food; you watch this back; 
there was; there was a mountain of food here;  

239
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:05,280
I eating two York puddings, like four slices 
of turkey, about three parsnips, two potatoes,  

240
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,080
three broccolis. - Yum, and I'm still going— I'm 
going strong on the Yorkshire puddings. Here we  

241
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:17,000
are, and who will be ill later on? You just said 
this earlier… - It’s what you do on Christmas;  

242
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,600
you gorge. - Yeah, I know, but it's not Christmas, 
not Christmas; it's not real Christmas day today;  

243
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,600
oh my God. - I love Christmas. - I'll keep 
chipping away. - Oh, you don't have to chip away;  

244
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:34,320
that makes it sound like a chore; just chill; it's 
all right; it's fine; you're good. - I don't know,  

245
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,760
Laura. - I'm going to have one more Yorkshire 
pudding; then that's it; I won't have any more  

246
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,080
'cause that's silly; I can't have otherwise I'll 
be having four Yorkshire puddings. - Four. - But  

247
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,960
they are good; they're good yorkshire puddings, 
I’m proud of these. - They're delicious;  

248
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:54,280
amazing. See, your hat's gone. - Where? - 
It's fallen off! - Oh, it was small. It's  

249
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,760
too small. - You got a small— big head. I’ve got 
a small head. - I love roast dinners; have you  

250
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,960
noticed that when you describe a roast dinner to 
someone, it never sounds good? - People just go,  

251
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,960
“Yeah, it's just… What, veg and meat?” But then 
do other—do people in other countries—surely other  

252
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,200
people in other countries have had vegetables and 
meat at the same time? - Yeah. That’s what I mean,  

253
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,320
so like when you say it to people, it's like, 
“Okay?” But it's—it's the combination of it  

254
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,640
all with the gravy and, oh, it's really hard. - I 
think it's the traditionalism of it, the tradition  

255
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:32,080
of it; um, I think it’s… when it's especially 
because it's usually people have it on a Sunday.  

256
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,200
It's just nicer; it's just like a safe time. - 
The associations you have of it. - What do you  

257
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,440
associate with Sunday dinner? - Sundays. - Yeah, 
but like… - Um yeah; um, but not being at school;  

258
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:51,120
obviously, that was always fun. We’d go to church 
in the morning, then we come home, have a roast  

259
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,920
dinner, and then we go back to church. So, we went 
to church twice in a day. We would do the morning  

260
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,600
service and then the evening service. So, I 
associate eating a roast dinner and then knowing,  

261
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,560
'Okay, I've got two more hours to do what I want, 
and then I've got to go back to church.' So,  

262
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,520
I'd always... - See that’s annoying, though. - 
Yeah, I know. - 'Cause I actually kind of agree  

263
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,160
with you. When I had a Sunday dinner, I used 
to associate it with, 'After this, I've got,  

264
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,400
like, the afternoon and then the evening,' 
but then it's school tomorrow. So, actually,  

265
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,280
I wish maybe Sunday dinner was on a Saturday. 
- Yeah, but like the hour after Sunday dinner,  

266
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,000
I used to love that. ‘Cause I’d I have a full 
belly. I'd just eaten a really nice thing,  

267
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,080
um… - I always had coffee. - &eah, nice coffee, 
and with some biscuits or something— An After  

268
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,440
Eight! - Yeah! - I love After Eight. We should 
get After Eights for Christmas Day. Should  

269
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,880
get After Eights? - Yes, we should. - They’re 
really good. Um… then…. I was going to take a  

270
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,680
picture of this, but I didn't. Oh well. - We 
got the video! - We got the video evidence.

271
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:51,840
Um, uh… - After Eights. - After Eights, 
yeah, and then an hour where I can just  

272
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,840
do what I want. - Did you not do your... 
No, you did your homework at school. - No,  

273
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,160
I never did homework. I used to… sometimes I 
used to… my mom would make a coffee or something,  

274
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,720
and then in the time she was making a coffee, I'd 
run upstairs and try to do some homework. - Yeah,  

275
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,720
that's a good plan. And then I could just chill, 
watch some TV, full belly, and then it'd be like,  

276
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,920
Mom would go, ‘Right, want to get ready?' And when 
she said that, ‘right’… - So did you get changed  

277
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,600
out of your Sunday, like, church clothes? - So, 
at my church, we used to have to wear a uniform,  

278
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,040
which is very different 'cause I went to a special 
kind of church, and we wore… - ‘Special’... - And  

279
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,440
we had to wear a uniform. So, I'd be in my uniform 
in the morning, and then I would wear... 'Cause my  

280
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,080
uniform was like a polo shirt and then a skirt. 
So, I would just change out of my skirt into some  

281
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,600
jeans, keep my polo shirt on, put a jumper over 
the top, and then I just... Yeah. - Sid your heart  

282
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,160
sink when she... When your mom went, 'Right?' - 
Well, yeah, but that's the mom, ‘right’? Which  

283
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:52,000
everyone can relate to. Or the parent thigh slap 
or when people go, ‘Well.’ - ‘Right’. - Sometimes  

284
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,160
it's a good thing if your parents 
have taken you to someone's house,  

285
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,280
and you don't want to go to their house. - 
Yeah. Absolutely. - And they’re talking to,  

286
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,560
like, their friend. - And they're on the way out 
of the house. - And you’re just sitting there  

287
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,040
like… - And you’re like 'Right, we're getting in 
the car, we're getting in the car, we're getting  

288
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,320
in the car,' and then somebody says, 'Oh, tell 
you what, did you want that coat for that? Oh,  

289
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,120
yeah! Let me just come upstairs,' and then you're 
like, ‘No!’ - It’s like, ‘Oh, come on!’ - I have  

290
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,440
so many memories of being in someone's house, sat 
on the floor. - Or waiting for your mom to come  

291
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,120
off the phone. - Yeah, yeah, and you’d just be 
sat on the floor waiting for your parents to go.  

292
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,680
they'd be talking to their friends or whatever, 
and then… - Lovely, a lovely, burp. Lovely,  

293
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,640
Laura. I can't believe it. - And then you’d hear… 
- I’m going to get some more Bucks Fizz just to  

294
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,000
finish this off 'cause we've only got a bit left 
in the... - Okay, can I just finish what I was  

295
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,440
going to say? - Yeah. - And then you hear the 
parents going, 'Well,' and then you go, 'Right,  

296
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:41,520
that's my cue. We're going home. We're going home. 
Woop Woop Woop!’ Oh, I'm so full. - It was so  

297
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,800
exciting that... - Yeah. - Laura. - Did you like 
that? - I loved it. That was good, wasn’t it? - I  

298
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,920
thought it was delicious. - That was really nice. 
Something else that I associated with... - Thank  

299
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:55,640
you. … Sunday was, and you definitely wouldn't 
have associated with this: football. - Oh  

300
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:03,120
no. - Just like, um… - My hunch... I just looked 
in the camera. My hunch was, uh, intense. - Um,  

301
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm going to put that bottle in there. - 
Okay. - Um, no, yeah, we used to have, yeah,  

302
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,240
so like having a full belly and then watching 
whatever team is on, and it's always a good game  

303
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,080
on a Sunday. So it's like, I don't know, for some 
reason, I'm thinking like Tottenham, Tottenham,  

304
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,000
Manchester United or something on a Sunday. Oh, 
and just... And you just know I'm just relaxing,  

305
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,640
watching this with a coffee. It's great. - No, 
when you were having football on, we had Songs  

306
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,560
of Praise on, I think, which, is, so essentially, 
church in the morning. - Yeah, and it's a... Then  

307
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:45,600
Songs of Praise is like… - Is church. - Is 
it just a televised church service? - Where  

308
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,640
they sing songs of praise? They sing songs for 
Jesus. So we go to church in the morning… - And  

309
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,320
there's always a crowd of people there. - Yeah, 
singing. - Because they... And they all really,  

310
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,720
really sing because they know, 'Oh, I'm going 
to be on the television.' Whereas actually,  

311
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,080
if that church was not on the television... 
- Well, they take the cameras to a church,  

312
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,560
a random church in the UK, and they... 
They do the songs from that church. - Yeah,  

313
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:09,200
they... There's a Welsh version of it as well. 
‘Dechrau Canu, Dechrau Canmol’ What? - Which is,  

314
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,280
‘Start Singing, Start Praising’. And it's 
the same idea. They did it in my church a  

315
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,840
couple of times. - Well, there you go. So, 
church in the morning, church on the telly,  

316
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,520
church in the evening. - Is there any novelty in 
watching that Songs of Praise on a Sunday for you,  

317
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,040
or did you hate it at the time? - Um, I think 
now there's no 'cause it's Nostalgia. Now it  

318
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,720
feels like, 'Oh, that reminds me of when I was a 
kid and my childhood home and everything.' But,  

319
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,960
um, at the time, yeah, I just wanted to be 
upstairs and doing my own thing. And, like,  

320
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,760
or I do remember being in the living room after 
eating a Sunday dinner on a Sunday, obviously,  

321
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,600
and then, um, uh, like sitting on the floor with 
my toys while the parents were sat on the sofas,  

322
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,960
like napping probably 'cause they were so tired. 
Um, and I just be playing with my toys. Have  

323
00:28:51,960 --> 00:29:00,960
you ever had a roast dinner not on a Sunday? - 
Today’s a Saturday. - True. Probably Christmas  

324
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,080
Day is the day where you're most likely to have 
a roast dinner not on a Sunday. - Christmas  

325
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,440
day doesn't feel like it's a day of the week. - 
No, no, people know this. People go, like, 'Oh,  

326
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,800
Christmas is on a Monday this year, isn't it?’ I 
was like, ‘Is it?’ - Because we don't have normal  

327
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,440
jobs. - That's true because we don’t have normal 
jobs. - But if... If... If you had a normal job,  

328
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,240
you would have to... - You would know. - 
…You’d go, like, 'Oh, Christmas is on, uh,  

329
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
Monday, which means I get three days 
off because it's Saturday, Sunday,  

330
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,360
and… then Christmas.” It’s like… How? - Well I 
think you get two days off 'cause I think... I  

331
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,920
don't know. I don't know how it works. Um, but 
yeah, no, I... I like, yeah, Sundays are a nice  

332
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,640
memory for me, I think. Even though I spent a lot 
of it just going backwards and forwards to church,  

333
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,200
I think overall Sundays are a nice memory. - 
For me… - Sunday evenings, no. Sunday evenings,  

334
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,480
you're thinking about school. - Yeah, but then 
also I think... I could... I could cry about it  

335
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:50,040
now. It's so lovely, just like... Like, you're 
finishing, you're like, 'You had your Sunday  

336
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,240
dinner, then you, like, you watch the football 
or whatever,' and then, like, maybe, like,  

337
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,760
'Cause my grandparents would have come around, 
then they've gone, and then maybe you have, like,  

338
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,560
some biscuits or something for tea or something 
like that. And then, like, it's especially in  

339
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:08,480
the winter time, it's dark outside, and you feel, 
like, so, like, cozy. Going upstairs and, like,  

340
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,960
just playing, like, a video... It sounds stupid, 
just playing a video game, but, like, that was,  

341
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,000
like, my safe space just to go, 'I'm just going to 
enjoy this, and knowing I've done all my homework,  

342
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,760
all I've got to worry about is, like, the next 
day.' - Yeah. And, like, yeah, that was so  

343
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,640
lovely. Yeah. - Don’t cry. - My nan used to come 
over. She... I know. Oh, yeah, it's nice. My nan  

344
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,720
used to come over, uh, on a Sunday, and she 
only lived, like, a 5-minute walk away. Well,  

345
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:43,600
10 minutes for her. She was slow, and, um, she... 
Because every time she came over every Sunday,  

346
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,480
I would... She would have a room inspection. She 
would look at mine and my sister's bedrooms to see  

347
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,120
who is the tidiest. And my sister never— Was never 
the tidiest, and being, I was like a little swot,  

348
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,960
I'd like properly… - “Look at mine, Nan, look at 
my room!” - I'd like— But it was a good excuse.  

349
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,520
It was a good excuse 'cause I would really, 
really, really tidy my bedroom every week,  

350
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,120
and it was a really good reason for me to get rid 
of some stuff that I didn't need, etc. And then  

351
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,600
she'd come upstairs, she'd be like, 'Yeah, very 
nice, really, really good.' And I’d go, 'Yeah,  

352
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,560
look at this, look at this, very tidy, look, I've 
even folded all my clothes.' And she'd be like,  

353
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,200
'Oh, yeah, very good. - I remember that 
feeling when you would decide to tidy your  

354
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,120
whole room and then you want to show it off 
to your parents. I remember doing that. Used  

355
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,720
to love doing that. - And then I'd go, 'Do 
you want to see my sister's room?' She'd go,  

356
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,440
'Oh, go on then,' 'cause she knew it was going 
to be bad. And then I'd go in and go, 'Look,  

357
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,760
she's got her magazines under the bed, look, she 
hasn't done this, and look, what's this, like,  

358
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,080
old spoon doing here?' - You are such a little 
brother. You're the most little brother thing  

359
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,560
ever. I used to love doing that, though. I would 
go, ‘Right, I'm going to really do my room,' and  

360
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,800
then I'd go, like, 'Mom, do you want to come see 
my room?' And I'd love, like, opening the door  

361
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:51,200
and going… - She’d walk in, 2 seconds later, 
‘right’. She'd leave. - Time to go. - Well,  

362
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,400
speaking of which, Laura, I think we should 
go and relax. - And tidy up, probably,  

363
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,200
wash up. - I can't believe I haven't finished 
it, but we did have a lot of food, please. - It  

364
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,040
was a lot of food. - It was delicious, Laura. 
- Thank you so much. - I need to sleep and a  

365
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:10,120
coffee. - A coffee. - And a mince pie. - I can’t— 
We've had a bottle of Bucks Fizz. - Can we have,  

366
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:16,480
um, maybe a mince pie in, like, an hour? Let 
this go down, and then have a mince pie. Does  

367
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:23,280
that sound good? - Cup of coffee and a mince 
pie. - Where’s your wrist support? It's, uh,
