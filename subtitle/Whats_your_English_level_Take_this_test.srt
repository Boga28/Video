1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,082
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish

2
00:00:04,082 --> 00:00:08,711
and today we are going to find out the answer to this question:

3
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:11,134
What's my English level?

4
00:00:11,134 --> 00:00:15,336
It's a question that my students ask me all the time.

5
00:00:15,336 --> 00:00:17,827
How do I find out my English level?

6
00:00:17,827 --> 00:00:22,279
Well firstly nothing will beat a personal English level assessment

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,417
with a qualified English teacher

8
00:00:24,417 --> 00:00:28,900
but I wanted to help you to get an idea about your level

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,908
and find out where you need to improve your skills.

10
00:00:32,188 --> 00:00:36,529
So I've created an online English level test that you can do

11
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,731
right here today.

12
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:41,430
Are you ready to find out your English level?

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,262
Let's go!

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,667
To help you find out your English level today,

15
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:54,563
I've created an English test that gets progressively

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,613
more challenging at every step. The first fifteen questions are

17
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:03,003
basic levels. You should get most of them right.

18
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:06,581
If you get more than five of these wrong in this section

19
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:09,669
then you're probably at about this level.

20
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,698
Then the next fifteen questions are intermediate.

21
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,961
If you get more than five of these questions wrong then your level

22
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:19,502
is going to be somewhere around

23
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:21,560
intermediate, upper-intermediate.

24
00:01:21,764 --> 00:01:25,618
Then the last fifteen questions are advanced

25
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,779
and these should really challenge you.

26
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:31,653
If you get less than five of these answers wrong

27
00:01:31,806 --> 00:01:32,966
wow!

28
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:36,162
Amazing! You're quite an advanced English learner,

29
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,954
particularly when it comes to your vocabulary range and your

30
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:41,329
use of grammar.

31
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:42,883
But here's the thing

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:47,697
even if you're not an advanced English learner yet,

33
00:01:47,697 --> 00:01:51,248
I still think that you should watch through to the end of the test

34
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:54,092
so that you can learn some new vocabulary and some new

35
00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,041
expressions as you go.

36
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:59,387
All of it is going to help you to improve your English

37
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:02,400
and push closer to that next level.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,608
Hey ladies!

39
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:07,897
Do you want to practise English in real conversations?

40
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:10,858
With really lovely speaking partners?

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,532

45

real conversations in English.

00:02:36,885 --> 00:02:39,098
your free trial today.

50
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:43,328
As we go through the questions you'll see a little countdown timer

51
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,537
which is going to show you

52
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,316
how long you have to answer that question.

53
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:50,139
Grab your notebook, grab a pen,

54
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:53,275
make sure you take note of the ones that you get wrong

55
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:54,756
and let's get started!

56
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,842
Sally goes to school every day.

57
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,453
I'm sorry! Stop being so angry with me.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,631
Some people are really afraid of spiders.

59
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,598
After I drank my coffee, I stood up to leave.

60
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,199
Yes, we are.

61
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,976
Yes, it does.

62
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,359
I do yoga on Monday at 8am.

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,908
I don't have any more money.

64
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
Amanda is shorter than Steve.

65
00:05:10,356 --> 00:05:13,382
We enjoy visiting the beach on the weekend.

66
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:27,087
How many packets of nuts do you want?

67
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,916
Margaret's been married since she was 17.

68
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,898
We have known each other for many years.

69
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,392
Tom used to wear shorts all the way through winter!

70
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,690
If I go to the party, I will pick you up on the way.

71
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,978
Okay how are you doing so far?

72
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:29,402
We're gonna move on to the next set of questions now.

73
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,044
We're gonna take things up a notch.

74
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:36,687
These questions are at the B1, B2 levels. That's intermediate,

75
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,172
upper-intermediate level.

76
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:40,435
They'll get progressively more challenging.

77
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,921
You haven't seen him perform on stage, have you?

78
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,524
I prefer spending time with people who respect me.

79
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,074
It's not the same as mine.

80
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,142
I don't need to be back at work until three

81
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:45,087
so we should have enough time to visit the gallery.

82
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,425
Since we live and work together,

83
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:02,144
we see each other every hour of every day!

84
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,214
He might have visited China before I met him.

85
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,232
If you had told me you needed a lift, I would have left earlier.

86
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:45,672
He lives on the other side of the country.

87
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,621
My brother borrowed my car over the weekend.

88
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,697
It was such a beautiful sunset.

89
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,629
Has she spoken to me about it?

90
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,603
You had better start looking for a new job.

91
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,140
Neither do I.

92
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,389
I had been living in Penang for a year before I even

93
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,405
tried asam laksa.

94
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,561
What amazes me is where you get all of your energy from!

95
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:34,986
Woohoo! So you've made it to the last section of this test.

96
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:38,389
If these questions are starting to get a little trickier

97
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,687
that's because they are.

98
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:45,759
We're starting to focus on some common expressions and some

99
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,754
fixed phrases so you'll need to have a really good understanding

100
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:53,304
of English to confidently move through this next section.

101
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:58,105
Now if you're not super confident about your answer if you just

102
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:01,648
take a lucky guess and you happen to get it right

103
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:06,009
good for you but still make sure you add a little star

104
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,902
next to that question and just decide if you really should

105
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,000
count it as an accurate answer.

106
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,838
Just do it for you. You're doing this test for you,

107
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:21,600
no one else needs to find out about how it was or if you got

108
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,820
all of them right,

109
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:26,161
just be truthful to yourself, okay?

110
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,078
On the whole,

111
00:11:41,078 --> 00:11:44,854
I think you provided a good summary of what transpired today.

112
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,843
I agree with you to a point

113
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:00,349
but there has to be more to the story.

114
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,782
We had made plans to drive Granny to the hospital together.

115
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,667
And then for no apparent reason, Samuel decided not to come!

116
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,824
An electric car is a really economical way of

117
00:12:33,824 --> 00:12:37,840
driving across Australia because they don't require as much fuel.

118
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,791
This kind of web application,

119
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,527
which is often used by remote teams,

120
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:57,111
provides the opportunity for informal interactions

121
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:58,730
throughout the working day.

122
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,640
There's no point trying to get everything done today. 

123
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,158
We'll just need to finish it off in the morning.

124
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,098
I had expected the airport to be deserted.

125
00:13:29,607 --> 00:13:33,637
But on the contrary, I'd never seen it so crowded!

126
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,603
Thank you so much for helping us get organised before we depart.

127
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,583
At the very least, let me buy you dinner to show my appreciation.

128
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,300
I would ask you to stop using such strong language,

129
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,331
you're offending our guests.

130
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,832
I know you're excited to get started but it's a delicate negotiation.

131
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,840
Let's just take it one step at a time.

132
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,988
I've read this article three times over

133
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,886
and I'm still not sure what it's getting at.

134
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,667
He will certainly not be invited to our wedding.

135
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,786
After the way he treated Martha, he's not welcome.

136
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,120
When in social situations, try to avoid using  

137
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,349
technical jargon when you're talking about your work.

138
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,829
The two parties had such differing views,

139
00:15:40,338 --> 00:15:43,891
they required a mediator to help settle their differences.

140
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,035
Mary has some quirks.

141
00:15:57,697 --> 00:16:00,567
Even so, I quite like spending time with her.

142
00:16:01,331 --> 00:16:04,103
Well done for making it all the way through!

143
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:07,689
Why don't you tally up your answers and see how you went?

144
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:10,669
If you want to, let me know down in the comments.

145
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,570
Let's just jump on to the last part of this lesson.

146
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,858
I want to talk to you.

147
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,619
Here's the thing.

148
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,957
I despise English levels.

149
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,675
Your English level on paper, the results that you get from a test

150
00:16:25,311 --> 00:16:29,301
is really helpful. It's useful to know that information

151
00:16:29,453 --> 00:16:31,567
but they do not define

152
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:35,738
who you are or what you're capable of doing in the future

153
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:39,467
and so often the way that we think about our results

154
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:44,023
or the way that we think about ourselves after we get those results

155
00:16:44,557 --> 00:16:48,879
actually stops us from improving or moving forward.

156
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,286
It really messes with our self-belief

157
00:16:51,286 --> 00:16:53,747
and it messes with our self-esteem

158
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,185
and our motivation to keep going, to continue

159
00:16:57,185 --> 00:17:01,960
and sometimes it's that thinking that convinces us to give up

160
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,444
or to reduce our ambitions, to settle for less you know.

161
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,206
I was aiming for this and

162
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,187
I don't think that I can do it.

163
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:16,782
I am very lucky to know many, many incredible English students

164
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:22,107
and I can confirm that those who score well on paper

165
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:25,425
are not always the best communicators

166
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:28,286
and that intermediate English speakers can be

167
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:31,982
vibrant and effective communicators as well.

168
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,611
Even if they don't have the

169
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:38,787
vocabulary range or the accuracy with their grammar,

170
00:17:38,787 --> 00:17:42,196
they can still use the language that they have

171
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:46,316
to communicate clearly and to communicate well.

172
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:51,021
So now that you have completed this English test make sure

173
00:17:51,454 --> 00:17:54,772
please for goodness sake, please make sure

174
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:58,046
you take note of the questions that you got wrong

175
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,953
including the ones that you just took a lucky guess
