1
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,040
That story I just shared with you contains all 
the 12 tenses of English, but you actually saw  

2
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,320
8 of them because we just cut it there at the 
ending just because you were going to see the  

3
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,720
future tenses stick around till the end.
To see those tenses in use as well. So let  

4
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,640
me ask you, wouldn't it be great if you finally 
mastered all those verb tenses so that you were  

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,840
able to feel like you didn't even have to think 
about them when communicating complex ideas? 

6
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,960
As you probably know too well, grammar 
is one of the things learners tend  

7
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,920
to get the most frustrated about.
A lot of people even hate grammar.  

8
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,120
They think it's made up of such strict rules 
and structures that it tends to leave them  

9
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,400
feeling like they aren't really speaking 
English, but solving some kind of math equation. 

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,760
If you think that way I'm here to 
tell you that you're absolutely right,  

11
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,920
it can feel like a math problem in the beginning 
but with the right strategy you can break through  

12
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,440
that initial resistance so that later that 
past perfect, simple past, perfect continuous,  

13
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,960
even the future perfect continuous becomes 
simply automatic and part of your fluency. 

14
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,760
Just like Kerimli, from Azerbaijan, 
who says that thanks to our channel  

15
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,160
his English has developed so much that his 
level has progressed more than his peers.

button and the Bell down below to start  

17
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,120
developing your English with all of our lessons.
Also if you watch until the end I have a special  

18
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,280
gift for you, so make sure you stay tuned.
With that said, let's jump into the lesson. 

19
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,080
I already mentioned that there are 12 different 
verb tenses in English, you might already be  

20
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,480
familiar with some of them, so that's great!
But think of each verb tense as having two levels: 

21
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,680
One is Structure, it's the knowledge of which 
auxiliaries we need to use how verbs change  

22
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:34,880
their conjugation and how we modify sentences to 
make them positive, negative and interrogative. 

23
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,600
The other thing is Case Use, 
when do we use the present simple  

24
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,040
or the present continuous. "Do I need to say 
this in the present perfect or the present  

25
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:51,920
perfect continuous?" and those types of things.
In my opinion understanding the subtleties of the  

26
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,040
different uses of each verb tense takes 
more time to master than understanding  

27
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,720
the structure of each different tense.
However this is what tends to create a  

28
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,400
lot of confusion and many times scares learners, 
so let's welcome our very own Tour of the Tenses.

29
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,200
The reason why a chart like this 
one can be very useful is because  

30
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,120
it allows you to visualize all the tenses.
We're going to fill out the different boxes now.  

31
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,080
After that we'll take a second look at the story 
of Lucas that I shared with you at the beginning  

32
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,440
of the lesson, we'll start with the simple 
tenses and for the sake of simplicity we'll  

33
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:41,840
use the same verb and object: drive my car.
Simple past, I drove my car yesterday. 

34
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,120
I think you already know this but here we just 
change the verb adding an -ed or using the correct  

35
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,080
word if it's an irregular verb.
I used the time word yesterday,  

36
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,960
you can use these other ones as well.
Sometimes you don't need to say it  

37
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,680
if the time of the action is understood.
Negative: I didn't drive my car yesterday. 

38
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,800
Interrogative: did I drive my car yesterday?
Now to the simple present:  

39
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,160
I drive my car every day.
If I say he or she the verb changes  

40
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,840
to drives, these are some of the different adverbs 
of frequency that you can optionally use as well. 

41
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,040
What are the auxiliaries to make a 
negative or interrogative sentence?

42
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,400
Now, simple future: I will drive my car tomorrow.
Here's a fun fact: technically speaking English  

43
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,320
doesn't have a future tense, however for the 
sake of not overcomplicating things, we simply  

44
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,960
refer to the use of will as you see here.
As the future simple you might also say I'm  

45
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,640
going to drive my car.
For the adverb of time  

46
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,040
you might say any of these words.
If you want to take full advantage  

47
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,840
of this lesson you can pause this video 
now and take note of all of these words. 

48
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,880
As for the auxiliaries you actually don't 
need any when you use will. Just add not:  

49
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,840
I will not or won't drive my car tomorrow.
Will I drive my car tomorrow?

50
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,560
How would you like to develop confidence in your 
speaking whilst having real-life conversations  

51
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,960
at the touch of a button with other 
learners from all around the world? 

52
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
Sounds like a dream, right?

58
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,280
Let's now move on to the next aspect of the 
tenses. As a technical side note here, aspect  

59
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,640
is when we say simple, continuous or perfect.
Tense is past, present and future. 

60
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,960
Let's take a look at the 
continuous aspect in each tense. 

61
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
In the past continuous I was driving my car  

62
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,760
yesterday. When we say something is in 
the continuous aspect we need to be. 

63
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,040
For the past tense we use either was or were. 
Can you guess how to form the negative and  

64
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,680
interrogative form of this sentence?
Comment the answer down below. 

65
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,240
In the present continuous I'm driving my car now.
Instead of now we might say right now or at  

66
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,560
the moment. There aren't really many 
options for the present continuous. 

67
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,080
Instead of am we use are or is. For the 
other pronouns like you, she, he, they, etc. 

68
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:07,920
In the future continuous I will be driving 
my car when you arrive. This tense indicates  

69
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,600
that something will occur in the future and 
continue for an expected length of time. 

70
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:19,360
The difference with the simple version I will 
drive my car is that you emphasize that the  

71
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,680
action will occur over an extended time frame.
For the future continuous you need the base  

72
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,280
form of to be. That's not the am 
is our forms the base form be. 

73
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,920
We're now at the midway point 
of this Tour of the Tenses.  

74
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,640
We've already seen the simple and continuous 
aspect, now it gets a bit more difficult. 

75
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,320
Let's take a look at the perfect aspect past 
perfect: I had driven my car when you arrived. 

76
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,680
With this tense we always use the auxiliary have,  

77
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,400
furthermore this tense always needs to 
be associated with another past action  

78
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,320
in the simple past.
This way the past perfect  

79
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,840
indicates that it's an action that happened 
before the action in the simple past. 

80
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,520
Let's take a look at this phrase in 
the past simple: when I went to Italy. 

81
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,720
If you say "I had already learned 
Italian when I went to Italy"  

82
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,800
you're communicating that the action of 
learning happened before you traveled to Italy. 

83
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,480
Present perfect: I have driven my car. Here 
the verb goes in its past participle form:  

84
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,680
Drive is the present form of this verb, drove the 
past form and driven is the past participle form. 

85
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,560
This sentence could also be: 
I have already driven my car.  

86
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,160
There are a lot of different words that 
you can use with the present perfect. 

87
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,960
Now to the future perfect: I will have 
driven my car by the time you arrive. 

88
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,800
We need the auxiliary 'have' for this 
tense. We almost always use the phrase  

89
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,200
by the time when we use the future perfect.
With this tense we indicate that an action will be  

90
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,160
finished by the time another action takes place.
And finally we're now combining two aspects:  

91
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,560
perfect and continuous.
So the past perfect continuous:  

92
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,720
I had been driving my car for two hours when 
you arrived. Like with the past perfect you  

93
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,840
use this tense to talk about an action that 
took place before another action in the past. 

94
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,480
The reason why we say it with a continuous form 
is to put emphasis on the duration of the action. 

95
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,120
Example: I had been waiting for you 
for one hour when you showed up. 

96
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,440
Now the present perfect continuous: I 
have been driving my car for two hours. 

97
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,000
The present perfect continuous is 
a lot more common than the past  

98
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,080
and future present continuous. We use it 
again to emphasize the duration of an action. 

99
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,000
And finally the future perfect continuous:  

100
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,040
I will have been driving my car for 
two hours by the time you arrive. 

101
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,040
We use two auxiliaries: have and been. They 
never change, again like in the future perfect  

102
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,480
with the future perfect continuous we need 
to use the phrase 'by the time' and then  

103
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,240
'you' + a sentence in the present simple.
I will have been traveling six hours  

104
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,360
by the time I land in New York.
So here land is in the present. 

105
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,920
If you find it difficult to remember new words 
you've learned check out this lesson I made about  

106
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,240
how to develop advanced fluency. You can click 
up here or the link down below to watch it next. 

107
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Let's now go back to the story of Lucas. I'm 
going to tell it again and I'll highlight some  

108
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,320
sentences on screen. You have to think about 
where it should go in the Tour of the Tenses.

109
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,720
Here we're just highlighting the key words 
from the sentence. In the sentence in the  

110
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
present perfect continuous we specify the 
duration of the action "he's been studying  

111
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:51,840
English for four years." You can also say it with 
'since': He's been studying English since 2017. 

112
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,880
Let's continue with the story.

113
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,840
Can you also spot the other 
sentences in the present simple here?

114
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,800
Let's continue on with the story.

115
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,960
So we've reached the end of today's lesson. 
I hope you found it useful and now for your  

116
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,480
special gift we've created a downloadable 
PDF with the Tour of the Tenses for you! 

117
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,120
The link is in the description down below.
Before you go what have you learned in this  

118
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,320
lesson. You learned that there are 
12 tenses in English. We didn't get  

119
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,840
in too deep about the use of these tenses but 
we've shown you the form or structure of them. 

120
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:25,280
I recommend that you don't stop here and 
continue exploring the tenses. Believe me,  

121
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,320
that when you master them your grammar 
fluency is going to go through the roof. 

122
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,360
Lastly, if you're interested 
in learning Lucas's whole story  

123
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,000
let us know down in the comments. 
We might create a lesson on the  

124
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,840
short story we have written about him and 
his adventure with the English language.
