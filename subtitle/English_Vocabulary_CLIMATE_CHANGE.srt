00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,150
Hello. I'm Gill at engVid. And,
today, we have a lesson on some

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,070
vocabulary, and it's all
connected with climate change.

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,900
So, if you.   you probably know
a lot about this subject

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,570
already, but if English isn't
your first language, then this

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,930
might be useful for you to teach
you some of the main terms which

6
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,940
are used in English to do with
climate change, which is also

7
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,280
called "global warming", because
the problem is that the

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,760
temperature is rising gradually,
but.   but definitely. So,

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,040
"climate change" is to do with
global warming; the temperature

10
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:58,500
rising. Okay. And one of the
main reasons for it is that for

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,110
many years now, we've been using
what are called "fossil fuels",

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,920
which are things like oil and
gas, and coal. And I think

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,840
caught.   coal goes back a very
long time, more than 100 years,

14
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:21,960
and causes a lot of air
pollution. Okay. So, the "fossil

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,330
fuels" are the things we.   we
need to try to stop using, and

16
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,540
to stop.   especially mining for
coal; no more digging coal out

17
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,900
of the ground, and burning it
for.   for power. Okay? Because

18
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,930
all of those produce CO2, which
is the chemical formula for

19
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,530
carbon dioxide, which goes into
the atmosphere, and it just

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,780
makes things warm up even more,
what are called "greenhouse

21
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,220
gases". If you think of a
greenhouse, which is a sort of

22
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,290
glasshouse that you grow things
in — things like tomatoes,

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,320
fruit, other plants that like a
warm atmosphere — so in a

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,720
greenhouse, which is made of
glass, that.   the glass, and

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,050
the light, and the sunlight
coming through the glass helps

26
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,270
to keep it warm inside. So,
that's why we have this kind of

27
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,150
metaphor: "greenhouse" to
describe the kind of gases, such

28
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,510
as CO2, which contribute to
global warming. Okay?

29
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:50,160
So, all of this is described as
a "threat to human life",

30
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,190
meaning human life is in danger
because of all this climate

31
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,640
change which is going on. And
not just to human life, but also

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:11,640
the last of species, which can
either be plants, or animals, or

33
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,550
things like the coral reefs
under the sea. A lot of those

34
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,250
different species are becoming
extinct; coral reefs are sort of

35
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:31,320
disappearing. So, all these
things that we're losing — it's

36
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:37,980
not a good thing for the
environment. Okay. So, and one

37
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,460
term that's used — a result of
climate change — is "extreme

38
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,380
weather", which can be all sorts
of extremes. It can either be

39
00:03:49,380 --> 00:04:00,180
too wet or too dry.   so.   too
hot. I think too cold — I don't

40
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,870
think that's one of the extremes
so much, but definitely things

41
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,660
getting too hot. "Heatwaves" —
when you have a very high

42
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,010
temperature, more than 40
degrees temperature. Some

43
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,380
countries are going into 50
degrees, so that's called a

44
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:25,920
"heatwave" when it's so hot, you
can hardly go outside; you can't

45
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,140
walk, you might feel faint, you
might collapse because it's so

46
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:39,540
hot. So, "heatwaves". This word
is pronounced: "drought". It's a

47
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,890
strange spelling, but a
"drought" is when there is no

48
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:50,370
water; there's no rainfall., so
everything dries up, and you

49
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,440
can't grow crops, things like
that. So "drought", but then the

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,690
opposite: "storms" where you
have heavy rainfall. So, those

51
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:06,450
are the extremes — very dry or
very wet. Storms, "hurricanes",

52
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,450
when you have a very strong wind
coming. And then because.   if

53
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:17,790
it's very dry and hot, it.  
you're more likely to get

54
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,730
"wildfires", which are fires
that might just start for no

55
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:29,340
reason. Or it may be somebody
has thrown a match on the ground

56
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,840
and the grass has started to
burn, and the fire spreads. But

57
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,630
sometimes a fire can just start
almost on its own, and then they

58
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,760
spread in an area with a lot of
trees. The trees are very dry.

59
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,780
In places like Australia,
California — there are very

60
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,580
often wildfires, and the fires
just spread and spread. If the

61
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,450
trees are there, the fires will
just spread. And people with

62
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:05,730
houses in those areas, they
often lose their homes; their

63
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:12,660
homes burn down as well. Okay,
so that's "wildfires". If it

64
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:20,610
does rain very heavily, you get
"floods". So, people go out and

65
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,790
they.   they.   they're
having.   they've got water

66
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,680
coming up to their knees or even
higher, or they can't go out at

67
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,430
all because the water is so
high. So, "floods".

68
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:40,460
And scientists think that even
"volcanic eruptions".   if you

69
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,720
think there are a lot more
"volcanic eruptions" nowadays;

70
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,980
if you think: "Oh, there seems
to be another volcanic eruption

71
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,460
every.   every few months. Is it
more than usual?" Scientists

72
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,190
think that even volcanic
eruptions could be a result of

73
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,560
global warming. It's a theory, I
think at the moment, but it's

74
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,240
partly to do with the.   if
there were glaciers on the

75
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:20,870
mountain, the.   the ice, the
glazier — a big sheet of ice —

76
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,700
if that melts, and they do melt,
the weight of the glacier

77
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,920
pressing on the volcanoes
possibly helps to stop the

78
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,270
volcano erupting. But if the
weight of the glacier has gone,

79
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,120
there is less weight pressing
down, and that may be part of

80
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,630
the, you know.   likelihood of
an eruption. So, that's another

81
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:59,870
thing. So, "rising sea levels" —
the sea rising, partly with ice

82
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,180
melt.   melting. And then, if
you have smaller islands, in

83
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,890
places like the Pacific Ocean,
there are a lot of little, small

84
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,000
islands — they could disappear
completely if the sea level

85
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,180
comes up high enough; islands
will be just lost. So, the

86
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,640
melting ice is.   a lot of it is
in the North Pole, the Arctic,

87
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,940
and the South Pole, the
Antarctic. And it's the melting

88
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,000
ice, and very big pieces of ice
break off and float around in

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,320
the sea, and gradually melt. And
they're helping to raise the

90
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:51,680
level of the sea, which is
another danger. Okay. And then

91
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,290
the other way is, again.   so,
if.   if there's.   if it's very

92
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:03,950
dry, what used to be farmland
where people grow crops for

93
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:11,600
food, the farmland could go very
dry and turn into a desert. So,

94
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,920
it.   it may have looked very
green at one time, and then you

95
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,670
see it looks sort of yellow or
brown, and you can't grow

96
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,420
anything there unless you have
water to water it with

97
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,910
regularly. So, farmland becoming
desert, then you can't grow

98
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:36,410
crops, so that will then lead to
food shortage; not enough food

99
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,270
for everybody. Okay.

100
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,680
So, you may wonder: "Well, what
can we do about it? What.  ?

101
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,710
What are the contributing
factors?" Well, two of them are

102
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,890
to do with transport and things
that we do at home. So,

103
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:06,800
transport, traveling by plane,
by car adds a lot to the global

104
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,710
warming because of the fuel
that's being used. If, you

105
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:19,610
know.   the planes have fossil
fuels to.   to power them. And

106
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,290
cars have either diesel or
petrol, which is fossil fuel

107
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,510
again. And there's a trend now
to make a lot more electric

108
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:35,480
cars, where that will be less
harmful to the environment.

109
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:41,330
Okay. But then if.   if you
avoid planes and cars, and go

110
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,370
use public transport instead, or
walk, if you don't have too far

111
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,080
to go, then that's one thing
that.   that can be done. Okay.

112
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,750
And then at home, household
appliances, electrical

113
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,780
equipment, heating, the heating
in your house. If it's.   if

114
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:10,160
it's gas, then it's.   it's a
fossil fuel. And then, if your

115
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,700
house doesn't have.   or your
home doesn't have insulation, if

116
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,680
the.   if the heat that you have
in the house can escape through

117
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:30,590
cracks in the window, or in the
door — if it's drafty, so you

118
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:35,480
have to turn the heating up to
keep warm — then that's a bad

119
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,640
thing. So, another good thing
that we can do is insulation,

120
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,740
for example, double glazing for
windows; two sheets of glass in

121
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:50,120
the window, rather than one,
and.   and things like that.

122
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:58,280
Okay, so.   so that's just a
very short summary, really, of

123
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,140
climate change, global warming,
and some of the vocabulary

124
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:10,880
connected with it. So, I hope
that's been helpful for you. And

125
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:16,550
there will be a quiz on this, so
please go to www.engvid.com and

126
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,550
try the quiz. And see you again
soon. Okay. Bye for now.
