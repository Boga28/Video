Vanessa:
Hi. I'm Vanessa  

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,760
from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Do you know 
these very American things? Let's talk about it. 

3
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,240
Do you know this song? Most Americans 
immediately recognize this tune, even though  

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,280
my poor singing. You're immediately able 
to recognize this song because it is a  

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:39,200
common feature of American culture. So today I 
would like to help you learn 10 common things.  

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,560
Some of them are expressions. Some of them are 
activities. Some of them are cultural elements  

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:51,840
that all Americans know and you should too.
Now of course, the US is an incredibly diverse  

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,760
place with a lot of people who have various 
backgrounds. So this might not apply to everyone.  

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,400
I can't speak for all people living in the United 
States. But these are generally known things in  

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,560
the US that it's kind of fun to be able to know 
as well. So let's get started with the first one. 

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,120
And to help you remember everything that 
you learned in this very American lesson,  

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,480
you can download the free PDF worksheet that 
I've made for today's lesson. It includes all  

13
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,440
of these expressions, cultural elements, and 
ideas that I've talked about in this lesson.  

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,640
Plus, you'll see Vanessa's Challenge 
Question so that you can answer it and  

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,200
use what you've learned. You can download 
that PDF with the link in the description. 

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,600
All right. Let's get started with our first very 
American thing that almost all Americans know what  

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,960
it is. If I asked you, "What are you doing 
for the fourth," would you know what I mean?  

18
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:55,840
You might look at your calendar and say, "November 
4th? December 4th?" No. When someone asks you,  

19
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,360
"What are you doing for the fourth," they 
always mean July 4th. And that's because  

20
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,360
July 4th is the American Independence Day. And 
we usually just shorten this to the fourth.  

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,960
"What are you doing for the fourth? 
I'm going to the lake for the fourth.  

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,120
I'm not really doing anything for the fourth, 
but maybe I'll try to find some fireworks."  

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:22,320
We often shorten Independence Day or July 4th 
to just the fourth. And now you know that too. 

24
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,200
If I said to you, "Whoa, I just found a 
Benjamin on the street. I can't believe it."  

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,160
Huh? Would you think that I found a guy named 
Benjamin on the street and I just feel so excited?  

26
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:43,520
Maybe he's my long lost friend. Nope. If I said I 
found a Benjamin on the street, that means a $100  

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,760
bill. And that's because Benjamin Franklin is 
the guy who's on the $100 bill. So if you say,  

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,680
"Oh man, I really just need to earn some Benjamins 
this weekend. I need to pay my rent. I'm falling  

29
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,920
behind." That means you need to make several 
hundred dollars. It's just slang for a hundred  

30
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,360
dollars. So I hope for you, you find a Benjamin 
on the street someday. That would be amazing. 

31
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,560
If my husband Dan said, "Did you eat 
the last piece of cake?" I might say,  

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,200
"I plead the fifth." What is happening here? Am 
I telling him that I'm guilty? Or am I telling  

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,840
him I'm not guilty? I didn't do it. Well, 
this expression I plead the fifth has to do  

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,040
with the fifth amendment to the constitution. 
And that means that I don't need to tell you  

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,240
because maybe it will hurt me in a court of law 
later. This is a very legal type of statement.  

36
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,640
But we often use this in daily conversation 
to say yes, but I don't want to tell you. 

37
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,720
So when my husband asks me, "Did you eat the last 
piece of cake," and I say, "I plead the fifth,"  

38
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,520
he knows, yes, Vanessa ate it, 
but she doesn't want to tell me.  

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,960
So you can use this very American 
expression when you want to tell someone  

40
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:15,120
yes, but maybe you feel embarrassed to tell 
them yes directly. You can just say, "Ah,  

41
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:24,960
I plead the fifth." Great expression.
In 2004, I was a senior. Does this mean I was old  

42
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,800
in 2004? What if I told you also that in 2008, 
I was also a senior. Huh? If you're in America,  

43
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:45,680
you can probably guess that this means I was in 
high school in 2004 and I was in college in 2008.  

44
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,600
A senior means you are in your last year of high 
school or your last year of college. So in the US,  

45
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,360
we often have terms for first, second, third, and 
fourth year in high school and in college. So if  

46
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,920
you are in ninth grade, you are a freshman. If you 
are in 10th grade, you're a sophomore. Notice that  

47
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,600
the O in the middle of this word is silent, 
sophomore. If you're in 11th grade, you are  

48
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,400
a junior. We could say, "I'm in my junior year. 
I'm a junior." And if you're in two 12th grade, so  

49
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,240
the final grade of high school, you are a senior.
And this type of system also applies to college.  

50
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,360
You are a freshman, sophomore, junior, and 
senior in college, especially when you go to  

51
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,160
a four year college, these type of terms apply. 
So it's quite common that when you are a senior,  

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,920
you think you are much better than freshman. "Oh, 
I was never so small. They're so much like just  

53
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,600
little children, those freshmen. We are seniors." 
I think this is pretty common in high school  

54
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,200
that you see the people who are younger than 
you as so much younger. "I wasn't like that  

55
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,000
when I was a freshman." But really, you 
were. So this type of system is quite  

56
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,760
common in the US. And now you know about it too.
When you arrive in the US, you will probably need  

57
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:15,120
to fill out a visa form. And at the bottom of 
the visa, you need to sign your John Hancock.  

58
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,480
Is your name John Hancock? Well, if 
it is, you definitely need to do that.  

59
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,760
But this term, sign your John Hancock just means 
your signature. There's a little bit of American  

60
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:35,440
history behind this because John Hancock 
was a guy who signed his name big and large  

61
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:43,040
on the Declaration of Independence. So it was 
kind of a bold statement where these colonists  

62
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:50,400
in the United States or in the Americas told 
England, "We want to have independence." And  

63
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,440
it's a pretty big statement. Maybe there's some 
treason involved. So it's kind of scary to say,  

64
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
"I'm someone who supports this."
But John Hancock signed his name  

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,320
really large on that document. So it was bold and 
courageous. It was a big move. So because of this,  

66
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:16,480
his name is synonymous now with a signature. Sign 
your John Hancock, put your John Hancock here. We  

67
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,280
don't always use this instead of signature, but 
you will definitely hear this. And it's steeped  

68
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,480
in American history and now you can use it too.
Now we have two fun American idioms. One is if I  

69
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:36,800
said to you, "You shouldn't buy a new car. If you 
buy a used car, you get more bang for your buck."  

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,520
This expression, bang for your buck, kind of 
includes two American concepts. One is buck,  

71
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,680
which is slang for dollars. And the other one, 
bang, doesn't necessarily relate to guns, but  

72
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,800
I know guns are kind of culturally linked to the 
US. So we get this idea that you can get a great  

73
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,880
value for your money if you buy a used car. So 
you might say, "Yeah, you should get a used car.  

74
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:10,720
It's more bang for your buck. Don't get a new 
car. It's better to get a used car." This is a  

75
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,880
great expression, more bang for your buck.
When I was growing up, before we left for  

76
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:23,280
school almost every morning, it was pretty 
common for my sister and I to fight over  

77
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:31,040
who said, "Shotgun," first. Why were we trying 
to beat each other to say shotgun? What's that  

78
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,480
mean? Does that mean we want to carry a shotgun? 
Does that mean we were going hunting or shooting?  

79
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:46,000
No. Instead, shotgun is the passenger seat. And 
for some reason, this is the most desirable seat  

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,400
in the car when you're not the driver. So kids, 
I guess, not too young, but high schoolers or  

81
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,800
older kids always want to call shotgun. And 
we use that expression, "I call shotgun,"  

82
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:06,640
or just saying shotgun. And that means that's 
my seat. I claim it. And this is really common,  

83
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,040
especially with siblings, even with friends, 
too, that before you get in the car, if you're  

84
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,400
not the driver, you'd say, "I call shotgun." 
Well, maybe now you can call shotgun too. 

85
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:24,720
Have you ever eaten the most tasty bonfire treat 
in the entire world? This is something I look  

86
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:32,800
forward to every time we have a bonfire. It is 
s'mores. S'mores. This is something I didn't  

87
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,080
realize was very American until I was talking 
to some international friends. And they said,  

88
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,520
"What? We just toast marshmallows. What do 
you put with them?" So let me explain to you  

89
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,520
a delicacy, something amazing that 
has a special place in my heart. 

90
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,040
First, you have a graham cracker. This is a 
special type of cookie, even though it's called  

91
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,120
cracker, it's quite sweet. And then we have a 
piece of chocolate. So we often buy some Hershey's  

92
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,880
chocolate, break off a piece, put it on the graham 
cracker. And when you're having a bonfire, you set  

93
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,480
that close to the fire, not too close, but close 
enough that the chocolate gets a little soft. And  

94
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,120
then you take a stick and two marshmallows, you 
could do one, but two is better, and you toast  

95
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,480
them over the fire, very carefully to make sure 
that they don't explode into flames. Some people  

96
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,200
like that. Personally, I like them to be perfectly 
toasted and it is an art form. Let me tell you. 

97
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,120
So you toast them. And then when they're toasted, 
you put them on the chocolate and you take another  

98
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,360
piece of a graham cracker and you slide the 
marshmallows off and there you have the perfect  

99
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:50,800
s'more. Toasty, warm, melty, gooey. So perfect. 
So the next time that you are at a bonfire,  

100
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,360
maybe you can introduce this idea to your 
friends, or if you're at a bonfire in the US,  

101
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,600
you will definitely see people eating s'mores. 
Please try it for my sake. I hope you'll love it. 

102
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,000
All right. Now it's time for the song 
you have been waiting for. It is .   

103
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:18,400
Do you know this song? This song is Take Me Out 
to the Ball Game. And I included this here because  

104
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,440
there's a funny little story I wanted to share 
with you. One of my friends, you might follow his  

105
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,640
YouTube channel. His name's Jack. He has a YouTube 
channel called To Fluency and he's from the UK,  

106
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,760
but he's married to an American. And he told me 
that one time they were playing a game with some  

107
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,880
Americans. And the game was that you had to hum 
a song and your partner had to guess what it was. 

108
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,080
So his wife drew a card and it said, hum 
Take Me Out to the Ball Game. And she's like,  

109
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,560
"All right, this is a good song. It's easy. He'll 
understand it immediately." So she started to hum.  

110
00:11:53,840 --> 00:12:00,560
And he just looked at her like, "What? I've never 
heard that in my life." So obviously that was not  

111
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,600
a good moment in their game for them, maybe a 
little funny, but because of this, I realized,  

112
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,600
"Oh, maybe this song isn't quite so well known 
internationally, but it is a staple of American  

113
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:20,080
culture because baseball is extremely common. 
And this song is sung before every baseball game. 

114
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:26,320
So if you've ever been to any kind of big baseball 
game in the US, you've definitely heard this song.  

115
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,360
And if you memorize the lyrics, you'll be 
able to sing along and cheer with everyone.  

116
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,480
It's a great moment to kind of have that group 
feeling of excitement before a game. So make  

117
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,080
sure you check out Take Me Out to the Ball Game. 
You can search on YouTube and see some clips of  

118
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:51,840
crowds of people at baseball games, singing 
this song, quite fun and very American. 

119
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:59,600
Take me out to the ballgame. Take me out to the 
crowd. Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.  

120
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:20,160
I don’t care if I ever get back  

121
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:33,872
for it root, root, root for the home team. 
If they don’t win it’s a shame. For it’s 1,  

122
00:13:33,872 --> 00:13:37,360
2, 3 strikes you’re out at the old ball game!
Our final very American thing today also has to do  

123
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,480
with baseball. What if I said to you, "Your speech 
was awesome. You knocked it out of the park."  

124
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,080
Did you give a speech about baseball? Are 
you playing baseball? No. This just means  

125
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:58,880
it was amazing. You did even better than 
expected. You knocked it out of the park. 

126
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,400
Here we have the image of someone playing 
baseball. He's got a baseball bat,  

127
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:08,080
someone's pitching him the ball and he hits it. 
He doesn't just hit it into the outfield. That's  

128
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:15,360
where someone can catch it. He hits it beyond the 
field, out of the park. And this means it's a home  

129
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,600
run. No one can catch it. And it's great for his 
team. Everyone can get to home base and they might  

130
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,080
get a lot of points. So here knocking it out of 
the park is a great thing in baseball and in life. 

131
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:34,160
So if you do something really awesome, better than 
expected, you can use this expression. "Oh man,  

132
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,840
I can't believe it. But I talked to someone 
in English the other, and I think I knocked  

133
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:43,200
it out of the park. I explained myself exactly the 
way I wanted. I did it. And they understood me."  

134
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,520
Congratulations, you knocked it out of the park.
Well, congratulations. Now you are in the loop

these things that most Americans know. And
