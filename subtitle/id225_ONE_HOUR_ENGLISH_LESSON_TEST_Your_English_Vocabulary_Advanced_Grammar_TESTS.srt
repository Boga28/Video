1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,620
In this one hour English lesson, you are going to 
learn lots of advanced English grammar, vocabulary  

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:15,360
and sentence structure. But you're going to do it 
by completing tests. So you're going to complete  

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:22,080
different tests throughout this lesson to test 
your knowledge and then improve your knowledge  

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:30,780
at the same time. Because this is a long lesson, 
what I've done is I've divided it into five short  

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:37,500
sections. So we will complete one section you'll 
test your knowledge you'll learn lots and then  

6
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,200
we'll move on to the next session. And you can 
come back and complete these times and review  

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,540
the lesson materials at any time. Welcome back to 
JForrestEnglish training. Of course I'm Jennifer  

8
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:54,420
and this is your place to become a fluent, 
confident English speaker. Now let's get started.  

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:08,640
Here's how the test is going to work you're 
going to see a question and you'll see four  

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,600
options you have to decide which option best 
completes the sentence. I'll show you the  

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,420
question for only five seconds, which isn't 
a long time. So feel free to hit pause,  

12
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,960
complete the question and then hit play and I'll 
explain the answer. Are you ready? All right,  

13
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,920
let's get started with question one. 
To Text Sue. It's her birthday today.  

14
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:46,980
The correct answer is C. Don't forget to text 
Sue. It's her birthday today. The key word in  

15
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:56,280
this question is to which is the infinitive 
to text. Now there's only one possible option  

16
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:05,460
in the choices below where you can have the 
infinitive and then see don't forget to test  

17
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:15,840
now if this question didn't have to, and it was 
just the base verb well, then a B and D would be  

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:25,980
correct and C would be incorrect question 
to Mary with jogging today. Of the rain.  

19
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:40,020
The correct answer is C in spite of the rain 
and that's your key word here of in spite of  

20
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:49,080
and despite have the same meaning but you 
don't say despite of you just say despite  

21
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,540
if you want to learn more about this I have 
a full lesson explaining this. I'll leave the  

22
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:01,620
link in the description below. Question three. 
I think I'm allergic to your cat. I can't stop.  

23
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:13,680
The correct answer is B sneezing. Now this is 
a tricky one because you can have grammatically  

24
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:22,380
stop plus infinitive stop to sneeze and you 
can help stop plus gerund stop sneezing,  

25
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:29,400
but the meaning is different. When we're 
talking about no longer doing an action,  

26
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:38,400
we use stop plus Geron and based on the context 
of the question. We're talking about no longer  

27
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,000
doing an action so we need the gerund if you want 
to learn more about this, I'll leave a link in  

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
the description below. Question four. If you don't 
know the meaning of a word you can in a dictionary  

29
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:07,200
and the answer is C. You can look it up in 
the dictionary. Now this one is a vocabulary  

30
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,840
question because you need to understand what 
these expressions mean. To look something up  

31
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:22,200
is another way to say to search for or to find 
that specific information. Now we use this all  

32
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,100
the time because every time you Google, 
you're looking up information. So I use  

33
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:35,460
this expression literally every single day. 
Hey, what's up this restaurant closed? Table  

34
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,680
girl? I don't know if you look it up. Oh, we 
need to look it up. We shouldn't look that up.  

35
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:51,000
You'll use this every single day. Question 
five. My doctor me I should exercise more  

36
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,880
and the answer is a my doctor told 
me I should exercise more. Now this  

37
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,100
is one that students confuse a lot. I hear 
students say told to me I told to her. No,  

38
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:19,500
that doesn't work grammatically. We don't want 
to somewhat get rid of that too. I told her I  

39
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:28,200
told you she told me so that's what we need. 
and also I hear students they say me she said  

40
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:39,300
me to exercise more. No we don't want me after 
said she said I should exercise more we want  

41
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,660
applause after said. if you want to learn more 
about this I have a full video explaining it.  

42
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:54,420
you can find the link in the description below. 
Questions fit my boss me to her dinner party.  

43
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:08,640
And the answer is C. invited me to her dinner 
party. Now this one is both a vocabulary  

44
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:16,260
question because the only logical choice is 
invite. But it's also because of sentence  

45
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,260
structure. We could change the sentence 
structure and make it work. For example,  

46
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:31,920
my boss suggested that I come to her dinner 
party, we could say that but I have to completely  

47
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,580
change the sentence structure. So all the options 
could work. If we change the sentence structure,  

48
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,720
the only logical choice with the sentence 
structure is the My boss invited me because  

49
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:58,320
you invite someone to something my boss invited 
me to the movies to her house to the restaurant,  

50
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,680
a specific location now if you want to 
learn more about suggested because a  

51
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,400
lot of students they suggested me, which is 
incorrect. I'll leave a link to a video on  

52
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:19,740
that topic in the description below. Question 
seven. Sorry, I didn't quite what you said.  

53
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:33,420
And the answer is, hey, sorry, I didn't quite 
catch what you said. This is an expression to  

54
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:43,860
cat. Something in this context is the exact same 
as here. I didn't hear what you said. But notice  

55
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:51,420
option D is in the past four. And that doesn't 
work grammatically. So it has the same meaning  

56
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:58,200
but it's the wrong verb tense. So a cat is 
exactly the same. Now this is an expression  

57
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,740
you can use all the time, especially since you've 
probably struggled to understand native speakers.  

58
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:12,720
So when somebody says something to you, and 
you don't quite catch it, you can say sorry,  

59
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,740
I didn't catch that. I didn't catch that. I 
didn't quite catch that. Wait. It's just a word  

60
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:26,880
would add to me a little bit. I didn't quite catch 
that. So add that to your vocabulary. You'll use  

61
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:37,560
it all the time. Question Eight. I don't sleep 
in now, but I sleep in until noon on weekends.  

62
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:51,780
And the answer is C I used to I used to sleep 
in on weekends. Now notice all the options  

63
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:59,820
are slightly different sentence structures. And 
they're all grammatically correct if you use the  

64
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:07,500
correct meaning, but for here, we're talking about 
an action that used to take place in the past. So  

65
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:17,400
an action you routinely did in the past, but you 
no longer do now. And for that we need youth with  

66
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:26,160
a D you don't hear it in pronunciation, but it's 
there in spelling. I used to work at the bank,  

67
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:36,060
but now I work at the mall. So I'm routine action 
in the past but you will no longer do it now,  

68
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:42,060
students confuse this sentence structure all the 
time. I have a detailed lesson on this. You'll  

69
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:53,640
find a link in the description below. Question 
Nine. I don't need help but thanks. And the answer  

70
00:09:53,640 --> 00:10:03,900
is but thanks for offering thanks for offering 
thanks for offering. This is one that I hear a lot  

71
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:12,720
of mistakes with as well. Now notice here I have 
things for after four because four is preposition  

72
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:23,940
you must use the gerund verb for offering thanks 
for and then you can use a gerund verb or you can  

73
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:34,740
use a noun. Thanks for your help. Thanks for 
your offer your offer. Thanks for offering.  

74
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:46,140
And your final question number 10. The film 
sounded interesting but it to be really boring.  

75
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:58,740
And the answer is C. It turns out to be really 
boring. This is a vocabulary question because  

76
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:06,300
you need to understand what these expressions 
mean we use to turn out when we're talking  

77
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,740
about the end result of something. So let's 
say you're trying a new recipe and it's for  

78
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:21,780
chocolate chip cookies. You've never made this 
recipe before. Your friend could say how did the  

79
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:31,980
recipe turn out? How did the cookies turn out? 
Your friends is asking about the end result.  

80
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,460
Basically your friends is asking were they 
good? Were they bad? How did the recipe turn  

81
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:43,320
out? And you have a bite? Oh, it was awesome. 
They were delicious. The best chocolate chip  

82
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:51,120
cookies I've ever had. And in this context, 
they're talking about the movies end result.  

83
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:58,920
How did the movie turn out? It was really 
boring. It turned out to be really boring.  

84
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:06,300
So how did you do with the quiz? Put your score 
in the comments below. And if you learn some new  

85
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:12,300
expressions or new sentence structure, make sure 
you practice your new expressions or sentence  

86
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,340
structure in the comments below as well so you 
get really comfortable and competent with them.  

87
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,920
So here's what the test will work. I'll 
show you the question and you'll see the  

88
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,780
multiple options. Now I'll only show 
it for a few seconds. So hit pause,  

89
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,420
take as much time as you need and when you're 
ready for the answer hit play. I'll share the  

90
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:42,720
answer and I'll also explain why the answer 
is correct. Are you ready? Let's get started  

91
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,100
with question number one. There are about 
20 or so people waiting in the office.  

92
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:02,580
And the answer is so there were about 20 or so 
people waiting in the office. Now this is just  

93
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:12,660
an expression we use or so to me approximately 
around there are around 20 People approximately 20  

94
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:24,180
people but notice the word order there are 20 or 
so people compared to there are approximately 20  

95
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:31,320
people so the sentence structure is a little bit 
different. But this is a great casual expression  

96
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:39,360
to have in your vocabulary. I have 10 or so 
emails to reply to. I have approximately 10  

97
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:47,760
emails to reply to question two there was 
a problem with the cell phone but I it now  

98
00:13:51,600 --> 00:14:00,780
I have fixed it now. I fixed it. Now we need 
the present perfect verb tense because we're  

99
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:09,060
talking about a past action that's complete. The 
cell phone is fixed right now. So the action is  

100
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:17,160
complete. But there was a result in the present. 
We know about it because of the keyword now but  

101
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:25,500
I've fixed it now. Now what we're talking about 
a past action with a result in the present the  

102
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,920
best choice is the present perfect if you want to 
learn more about the past simple and the present  

103
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,560
perfect. I made a video on this. You'll find the 
link in the description below. Question three,  

104
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:52,080
I think going to the post this weekend. Be a good 
idea. And the answer is would be a good idea. What  

105
00:14:52,080 --> 00:15:00,780
is the best choice because we're talking about a 
hypothetical, it would be a good idea to go to the  

106
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:07,740
coast. If you change the word order. You can see 
that it would be awkward and unnatural to say it  

107
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:15,840
should be it should be a good idea to go to the 
coast may have should with recommendations or  

108
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:24,540
advice you should go to the polls this weekend. 
I'm recommending that to you. I'm advising you,  

109
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:32,160
but what we're just talking about a hypothetical 
would is the best choice question for the thing.  

110
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,820
Once a film gets a bad review, 
it's hard for it to do well.  

111
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:49,740
The thing is, the thing is, this is an expression 
we use in English we use it before we introduce  

112
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,560
an idea The thing is I don't think he should 
go to the coast this weekend. So it's just  

113
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,160
an expression that we use and based on the 
options is is the only possible choice to  

114
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:11,220
complete this expression. Question five I some 
old drawings when I was cleaning out my closet.  

115
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:23,340
I came across I came across some old drawings. 
The phrasal verb to come across something is  

116
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:30,780
used when you find something accidentally 
I wasn't looking for the drawings. I found  

117
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,600
them accidentally oh wow, look at these 
drawings. I haven't seen them in years.  

118
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,240
I had no idea they were here. Based 
on the context the only expression  

119
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:51,060
that made sense is came across but number six 
she managed to play tennis despite a sore arm  

120
00:16:53,460 --> 00:17:02,700
and the answer is despite how about a 
sore arm after despite you need a gerund  

121
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:09,840
verb because despite is a preposition 
despite having a sore arm. Number seven  

122
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:22,260
longer do we need to file that form? And the 
answer is no longer No longer do we need to file  

123
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:32,520
that form. This is an alternative structure to 
saying we don't need to file that form any longer.  

124
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:39,600
If you use the expression we don't need 
to you made the choice any longer because  

125
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,600
we don't use double negatives in English. 
So you couldn't say we don't need to file  

126
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,980
that form no longer that doesn't work. But 
if we're starting with no longer do we need  

127
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:00,840
because do we need is a positive you're making 
it negative with the choice no. This is simply  

128
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:07,380
an alternative sentence structure. To be honest, 
the more popular or common sentence structure  

129
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:17,280
is we don't need to file that form any longer. 
Number eight, they are to have arrived already.  

130
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,860
And the answer is they are 
supposed to have arrived already.  

131
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:37,500
The expression is to be supposed to they are 
supposed to have arrived already. Based on  

132
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,220
the sentence structure the only possible choice 
is supposed to a lot of students make mistakes  

133
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,560
with the expression supposed to I made a lesson on 
this topic. I'll leave the link in the description  

134
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,420
below. But number nine by the time they at 
the concert the tickets were already sold out.  

135
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,920
And the answer is by the time they turned 
up at the concert when a person turns out  

136
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:15,660
at or to a location it means they arrive 
at that location. So if you're at a party,  

137
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:23,880
you could ask someone when's Julie supposed to 
turn up when she's supposed to arrive? It's simply  

138
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,960
a phrasal verb and based on the options, this is 
the only expression that makes sense. Number 10.  

139
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,600
I was able to get to the top of the mountain  

140
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:49,380
and the answer is as I am, this is a 
useful way to describe yourself or to  

141
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:57,840
describe a situation beautiful as it was I 
didn't take a picture as smart as he is he  

142
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:07,320
didn't pass the test number 11 I'm 100% 
certain that everything okay in the end  

143
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:20,040
and the answer is I'm 100% certain that everything 
will be okay. In the end we use the future symbol  

144
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:28,440
will be when we're making predictions about 
the future. Now even though I say 100% certain  

145
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:37,440
it's still making a prediction because I don't 
control the future the outcome of the future is  

146
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:46,200
still unknown and I'm making a prediction 
of the future number 12 as a cab driver I  

147
00:20:47,040 --> 00:21:00,540
but I'd love a bigger paycheck. And the answer 
is I get by I get by but I love a bigger paycheck  

148
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:09,900
by putting in a paycheck. I know we're talking 
about money and the expression that by in terms  

149
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:19,260
of finances we use that when you're just able to 
pay for everything you need, but you don't have  

150
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:30,420
very much leftover I get by I get by question 
13 I don't want to spend the weekend with her.  

151
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:41,520
And the answer is as much as much as I enjoy 
her company. This is an expression and it's  

152
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,420
the only grammatically correct choice and 
the best choice based on the options much  

153
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:56,400
as I enjoy her company. Now notice once I enjoy 
her company, that's a positive but then the next  

154
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,640
part of the sentence is a negative. I don't want 
to spend the weekend with her. So this is a great  

155
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:10,320
transition sentence that you can use. Much as 
I enjoy studying English. I don't want to spend  

156
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:21,420
my whole weekend doing it. Number 14 The fact of 
the is our company has to increase its revenue.  

157
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:32,940
And the answer is the fact of the matter 
is, this is an expression the fact of the  

158
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,580
matter based on the options this is the best 
word choice to complete this expression. The  

159
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:45,960
fact of the matter is and then you state your 
applause The fact of the matter is I need to  

160
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,980
improve my English. And finally question 
15 The company has doubled its revenue.  

161
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,600
It still has a lot of problems to overcome.  

162
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,740
And the answer is however it still 
has a lot of problems to overcome.  

163
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,780
All of these options are transition words. The 
only transition word that's used for a contrast  

164
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:23,280
is however, and notice this is a contrast 
because idea one the company has doubled this  

165
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:30,240
revenue that's positive but then idea two there 
are still problems to overcome. What's negative,  

166
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,760
right so we're dealing with a contrasting 
situation. However, if you want to learn  

167
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,920
more about transition words, you can look in the 
description for a link I have a separate video  

168
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:47,220
so how to do on this advanced vocabulary test. 
Make sure you share your score in the comments  

169
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,200
below and if you got any wrong, just do some 
practice so you feel more comfortable with them.  

170
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:02,100
Are you ready to see if you know these 50 
Confusing English words. So here's how this  

171
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:09,360
video is going to work. I'm going to show you 
a sentence and you're going to have two options  

172
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:18,480
and you have to define which option correctly 
completes the sentence. Now I'll only show the  

173
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:25,680
sentence for a couple of seconds. So make sure 
you hit pause, take your time to read it to  

174
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,560
answer it and then hit play and I'll show you 
the answer and I'll explain why the answer is  

175
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:40,920
correct. Are you ready to go? Number one, there 
were people at the party than I had expected.  

176
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:51,780
The answer is fewer. There were fewer people at 
the party than I had expected. And the reason  

177
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:59,100
is we use fewer with countable nouns. You 
can count how many people there are, but we  

178
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:09,660
use less with uncountable nouns. So I could say 
there was less rain you can't count rain. There  

179
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:20,640
was less rain this year compared to last year. 
Number two, I've jumped in the a big project  

180
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:33,300
and the answer is mixed. Mixed. This is a tricky 
one simply because of pronunciation when you hear  

181
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:41,040
this in spoken English, I'm in the midst of a 
big project. It's easy to confuse this with mist.  

182
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,460
And to be in the midst of something is 
simply to be in the middle of something.  

183
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:57,240
So I'm in the middle of a big project number 
three Wow not sure it's really your hair.  

184
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:09,120
And the answer is complement with an E. These two 
words sound exactly the same in pronunciation.  

185
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:16,200
It's spelling that is different, but they have 
different meanings complement in this example  

186
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:27,000
is when one thing your shirt combined really well 
with another thing your hair. Compliment with an  

187
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:34,440
eye is when you say something nice to someone. 
I love your shirt. Thanks for the compliment.  

188
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:41,040
If you want to learn more about compliment and 
compliment you can look in the description for  

189
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:49,620
a link on a video on that topic. Number 
four that movie had quite an eye on me.  

190
00:26:52,140 --> 00:27:01,620
The answer is it had quite an effect on me. The 
pronunciation is very similar effect effect.  

191
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:09,120
There's a slight difference. But the spelling is 
important because offense is a verb and effect  

192
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:19,020
is a noun and we need a now you know that because 
there's an article in the sentence with the verb  

193
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:26,400
I can say that movie affected me. If you want to 
learn more about effects and effects you can look  

194
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:35,100
in the description for a link on that. Number 
five quizzes are a great way to your skills  

195
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:46,680
to home more skills. Again similar pronunciation 
but the correct choice is home. This is an  

196
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:56,580
expression to home one skilled this is simply to 
improve one's skills. Number six I didn't know  

197
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:09,240
at the party. I didn't know anybody at the party 
didn't is negative. In the English language. We  

198
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:18,660
do not like double negatives you can only use one 
negative in a a clause. And since I already have a  

199
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:28,860
didn't I can't use the negative Nobody, I have to 
use anybody. Number seven. I don't like carrots.  

200
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:40,320
I don't like carrot either. Now this is the same 
as number six because I don't don't is a negative.  

201
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:50,220
Neither is also a negative so we can't use it. 
We want either I don't like carrots either. To  

202
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:58,740
use neither I could say you don't like carrots. 
Neither do I neither do I. If you want to learn  

203
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,560
more about either and Deezer you can look in 
the description for a video I created on this.  

204
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:18,060
And number eight, she has more she needs. She has 
more than she needs similar in pronunciation. That  

205
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:28,860
then but they're two totally different words than 
we use in comparisons. More than less than fewer  

206
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:39,120
than comparison. Then is an adverb. It's used 
in time references, first all eat lunch, then  

207
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:50,520
I'll go for a walk number nine joining Social Club 
is for all purposes, the solution to loneliness.  

208
00:29:52,680 --> 00:30:01,620
For all intents and purposes, this is an 
expression in English for all intents and  

209
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:10,260
purposes. This simply means in almost every 
situation in virtually every situation,  

210
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:16,980
but when you say this at a natural pace for all 
intensive purposes, for all intents and purposes,  

211
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:27,240
it sounds like intensive. Intensive is a word that 
people are very familiar with intense and is not  

212
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:34,860
something that people are familiar with, but the 
correct expression is intents and purposes. This  

213
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:42,060
is a very useful business or academic expression 
isn't really used in casual conversation too much.  

214
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:52,860
Number 10. We can discuss this after the 
meeting. We can discuss this further after  

215
00:30:52,860 --> 00:31:02,220
the meeting further and further. Both mean more. 
We can discuss this more in more detail after the  

216
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:10,860
meeting we use further when we're talking about 
figurative and we use farther when we're talking  

217
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:20,580
about literal. For example, we need to walk 
farther we literally need to walk more we need  

218
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:27,900
to walk farther to see the waterfall. If you want 
to learn more about this look in the description  

219
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:41,100
for a link on a separate video number 11. You can 
down here you can lie down here, lay and lie they  

220
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:50,460
have the same meaning the lay is transitive it 
means an object. For example, lay the baby down  

221
00:31:50,460 --> 00:32:03,000
here lay the blanket down here you lay something. 
A lie is intransitive. So there's no object lying  

222
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:13,020
down here. Lie yourself down here. Lie down 
here. Number 12. That sweater is too for you.  

223
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:23,580
That sweater is to leash for you. This one is 
confusing because of the spelling do I need one  

224
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:32,160
or two? It's easy to forget. Lose with one oh 
is the opposite of When did you lose the game?  

225
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:39,540
Did you win the game? Did you lose the game? Lose 
with two O's when we're talking about clothing is  

226
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:46,920
when it doesn't fit closely to your body. So 
this shirt I'm wearing is not loose. It fits  

227
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:57,480
closely to my body but this sweater for example 
is loose number 13. We should worked harder  

228
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:06,660
we should have worked harder. Now this is 
a mistake that many native speakers make  

229
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:13,980
because in spoken English we take have which is 
the grammatically correct choice but we reduce  

230
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,980
it we say it quickly and it sounds like oh 
you should have you should have you should  

231
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:28,020
have worked harder. So sometimes need speakers 
forget that it's actually have a knot oh because  

232
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:33,300
that's what it sounds like in spoken English. 
So in spoken English you can absolutely say  

233
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:39,060
you should have you should have worked harder 
but in written English just remember that the  

234
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:50,340
correct choice is have number 14 I shouldn't have 
to the party. I shouldn't have gone to the party.  

235
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:59,940
Our verb here is dope. The past simple is wimps 
and the past participle is gone. This structure  

236
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:07,080
requires the past participle the third form 
of the verb. Yesterday I went to the party.  

237
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:18,480
I've gone to three parties this month. And 
finally number 15 Do you trust the most?  

238
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:29,579
Do you trust the most? Who at home it can be very 
tricky for students and native speakers to know  

239
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:40,020
the difference. Just ask yourself do you need 
she or her? Do you mean a subject or an object?  

240
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:52,860
she or her he or him? I trust her the most we 
need an object not a subject. So you use home  

241
00:34:53,699 --> 00:35:02,160
who is your friend? She is my friend. 
In this case. We need a subject so we  

242
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,100
use who so how to deal with this quiz. 
Share your score in the comments below.  

243
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:19,020
So here's how this question will work. I'll show 
you a question and there'll be a blank and you  

244
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:27,420
have to decide which option which verb tense 
best completes the sentence now I'll only show  

245
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,960
the question for a few seconds. So hit pause take 
as much time as you need. And when you're ready,  

246
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,360
hit play and I'll share the correct answer 
and I'll explain why that answer is correct.  

247
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:47,520
Are you ready? Let's get started. 
Question one, my flight at 9am tomorrow  

248
00:35:51,240 --> 00:36:01,860
and the answer is my client sees at 9am 
Tomorrow. Now both B and C are future  

249
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:09,060
verbs and we need a future verb because 
we have the key word tomorrow so I know  

250
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:17,760
we're in the future. But we use the present 
simple in the future on one specific occasion  

251
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:26,940
and not with timetable events with scheduled 
events. So transportation runs on a schedule,  

252
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:34,020
you get a ticket and it tells you the time. We can 
consider that a scheduled event. If you're going  

253
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:42,420
to a party, a wedding a meeting in the future 
and there's a scheduled event you can simply say  

254
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:55,320
my meeting starts at two o'clock next Tuesday. 
Question two she two books so far this year.  

255
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:09,600
And the answer is she has written two books 
so far this year. Your key word here is this  

256
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:17,880
year. This year is still in progress if 
it weren't complete, I'd say last year  

257
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,660
she's written two books so far this 
year. So which bird tent Am I using?  

258
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:34,740
The Present Perfect has written we use the present 
perfect for actions that started in the past but  

259
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:42,600
are still in progress. So the books she has 
written those are complete. Those two books  

260
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:49,740
are sitting on her shelf, but it's possible 
for her to write more books because the year  

261
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:57,120
is still in progress the present perfect 
number three, your eyes are red and puffy.  

262
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:09,720
And the answer is how have you been crying? 
Have you been crying? The verb tense here  

263
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:18,120
is the present perfect continuous. We need a 
continuous verb in this context because the  

264
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:27,480
focus is on that action. The focus is not 
on the result. The focus is on the action  

265
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:36,120
of crying. I want to emphasize the action 
crying How do you cry the present perfect.  

266
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:46,980
That sounds awkward because there's no focus on 
the action question for if I were you, I'd quit.  

267
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:59,760
And the answer is if I were you, if I were 
you now having i and we're side by side may  

268
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:09,300
sound unnatural to you because the past form 
of the verb to be with the subject I is was of  

269
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:19,560
course right. I was tired. I was angry. You 
were tired. You were angry. She was tired.  

270
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:29,460
They were tired. But this isn't in the past 
simple. This is in the subjunctive and the  

271
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:39,300
conjugation for the subjunctive verb is were for 
all subjects. I, you, he she, it, we they were.  

272
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:49,560
Now why does the question need the subjunctive? 
Because it's hypothetical. I'm not you. That's a  

273
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:59,100
hypothetical situation. If I were you, but I'm not 
you. I mean, right. If I were younger, if I were  

274
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:08,340
older, if I were taller, if I were shorter, those 
are all hypothetical situations. Number five a day  

275
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,720
at the bank sent 2009.  

276
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:26,160
And the answer is Dave has been working at the 
bank since 2009. Now where are you saying the  

277
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:32,580
present perfect continuous because the action 
started in the past and continues on till now.  

278
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:42,000
When did they start working at the bank? Dave 
started working at the bank in 2009. Where does  

279
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,740
they work now today at the bank, right so actually 
that started in the past and continues until now.  

280
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:58,620
Question sits Carmen has a hair appointment 
tomorrow, Carmen, her hair cut tomorrow.  

281
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:08,100
And the answer is Carmen 
getting her hair cut tomorrow.  

282
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,180
Now the first sentence is just to provide 
context. So you know there's a scheduled  

283
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:25,380
event. And that's important because we use the 
present continuous, not the future simple. We use  

284
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:34,440
the present continuous when we're talking about 
a scheduled event in the future. Let's say I have  

285
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:42,420
a plane ticket to go to Australia. In five years, 
even though it's five years, a lot of time away is  

286
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:52,500
still a scheduled event. So I would say I'm going 
present continuous. I'm going to Australia in five  

287
00:41:52,500 --> 00:42:02,460
years because it's a scheduled event. Question 
seven sound me well, to Paris at least five times?  

288
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:15,060
And the answer is Samuel how you gone to Paris 
at least five times. Now there's no indication  

289
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:22,860
of time. In this example. There was no past 
reference last year last month, and there's  

290
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:30,840
no future reference either. So I know we're just 
talking about in general, and we use the present  

291
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:39,060
perfect has gone we use the present perfect to 
talk about life experience, the things we have  

292
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:49,260
done or haven't done in our life. And the reason 
is because our life is unfinished. Our life is in  

293
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:57,360
progress. It started in the past and it continues 
until now. So while we're alive and still living,  

294
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:06,060
we use the present perfect to talk about our 
life experience. Question Eight, I think Sarah,  

295
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:18,060
a promotion next year. And the answer is I 
think Sarah will get a promotion next year.  

296
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:29,340
So my keyword here is next year so I know I'm in 
the future. And notice the other keyword I think I  

297
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:40,020
think we use the Future Simple to make predictions 
about the future. I think Sarah I don't know this  

298
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:50,580
100% It's a prediction. I think Sara will get 
a promotion next year. Number nine the client.  

299
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,180
By the time I checked my messages.  

300
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:06,600
The client Hi Paul, by the time I checked my 
messages, this is a past perfect. The past perfect  

301
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:17,340
is used to talk about a past action, a completed 
past action that takes place before another past  

302
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:27,780
action. So on our timeline, we have two past 
events. The client called I checked my messages.  

303
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:39,000
Now we use the past perfect for both the first 
pass option which is the older action, and we use  

304
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:47,940
the past simple for the second pass action, which 
is the newer action on our timeline. The client  

305
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:56,700
had called by the time I checked my messages 
and finally questions and I can't believe they  

306
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:07,740
their baby by the time we get there. And 
the answer is, I can't believe they will  

307
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:16,980
have had their baby by the time we get there. 
Which vertex is this? The future perfect. We  

308
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:24,240
don't use the future. Perfect too often, but it's 
still an important verb tense. We use the future  

309
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:35,640
perfect to talk about a completed action in the 
future. So let's say right now it's summer 2022  

310
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:49,260
And the baby is due in the fall 2022. So right now 
in summer, its future action, right. But let's say  

311
00:45:49,260 --> 00:46:01,260
I'm traveling to visit this couple in the winter 
of 2022. So I'm going to take my timeline from  

312
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:12,600
now and I'm going to change the timeline to 
winter 2022 and by winter 2022 The baby will  

313
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:22,680
have been born so that action all go into future 
action. Now when I change the timeline to winter  

314
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:32,760
2022 The action will actually be in the past. So 
did you know all of these verb tenses make sure

perfect so you can do that in the comments below.  

317
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:55,560
Are you ready to add the top 10 phrasal verbs to 
your vocabulary? Now make sure you watch right  

318
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,020
until the end because I'm going to sleep with 
you to see how well you know how to use these  

319
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:09,720
phrasal verbs. Phrasal verb number one to add up. 
We use this phrasal verb to say that something  

320
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:21,180
seems reasonable or likely and that something is 
usually a story, an explanation or a reason. So  

321
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:29,880
let's say your coworker took a week off of work 
because she had to care for her sick mother.  

322
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:38,580
But then she comes back to the office a week 
later and she's really tanned and it's winter.  

323
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:47,820
You might say something doesn't add up. Her story 
doesn't seem reasonable. Or likely something  

324
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:56,220
doesn't add up if she was taking care of her sick 
mother while fishing habitat. I bet she took the  

325
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:05,820
week off to go to the beach to go on vacation 
to beat down. This is a very simple but useful  

326
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:15,600
phrasal verb. We use this phrasal verb only with 
the sun when the sun is shining very strongly.  

327
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:24,780
So if you're sitting on a patio, and it's sunny 
outside and it's really really hot, you can say  

328
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:36,240
Wow, it's really beating down it being the sun. If 
you say it, you don't have to define the subject  

329
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:43,740
and now as the sun because we always use this 
phrasal verb with the sun so it's not necessary  

330
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:52,140
and the context of sitting on a patio on a sunny 
day is all unique. So it's really meeting down.  

331
00:48:52,140 --> 00:49:04,020
Now you can use an object and say us it's really 
beating down on us noticed I have to add an extra  

332
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:13,620
preposition ON beat down on someone or something. 
You can use a something you might say you should  

333
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:23,700
move your laptop. The sun is really beating down 
on it on your laptop. And that's not very good for  

334
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:31,500
your electronics right so you should put your 
laptop in the shade number three to tidy up.  

335
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:43,080
This is when you organize or arrange things in the 
right place. So you can take a bedroom and office  

336
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:51,600
a kitchen any individual room or you can take an 
entire house even and you might say this weekend,  

337
00:49:51,600 --> 00:50:00,900
I need to tidy up or this weekend I need to tidy 
my office up. So you're going to go in your office  

338
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:08,700
and you're going to put all this things the 
objects in the right place. So this is a very  

339
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:18,420
useful phrasal verb number four to talk down to. 
When you talk down to someone you talk to them  

340
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:27,840
in a way that makes them feel less intelligent 
than you or less important venue. So this is  

341
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:38,280
a negative phrasal verb. This often happens with 
adults and children, adults and teenagers parents  

342
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:46,200
and teenagers, a teenager might complain or a 
young adult might complain that their parents  

343
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:53,100
always talk down to them. They talk to them in a 
way that makes them feel less intelligent or less  

344
00:50:53,100 --> 00:51:00,480
important. This often happens in the workplace, 
especially with someone in a higher position and  

345
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,300
someone in a lower position that someone in a 
higher position might talk down to that person  

346
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:14,400
even though that person has a lot more experience 
than them. And there's no reason to do that. So  

347
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,740
this is used in a negative way but they commonly 
happen so you'll hear this phrasal verb a lot  

348
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:30,060
when people are complaining about other people. 
Number five to sum up this means to summarize the  

349
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:38,040
main points. We commonly use this phrasal verb 
when you're ending a presentation or a speech  

350
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,920
in your conclusion when you want to summarize so 
at the end of your presentation, you might say  

351
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:53,280
to sum up if we want to increase our profits, we 
need to diversify our product line so that's the  

352
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:59,880
main point of your presentation you elaborated on 
that main point and now you're saying to sum up  

353
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:07,020
to summarize so this is an excellent phrasal verb 
to add to your business vocabulary to sound very  

354
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:16,860
advanced, professional and natural numbers fix 
to joke around when you joke around it means what  

355
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:24,720
you're saying shouldn't be taken seriously. You're 
just joking. You're just being light hearted.  

356
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:34,980
You're just having fun. But we commonly use this 
to reassure someone. So you might say, Oh, don't  

357
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:43,320
get mad. I was just joking around. So maybe you're 
making comments about someone in a light hearted  

358
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:51,780
way, but they took it seriously and you reassure 
them Don't get mad. I was just joking around.  

359
00:52:52,500 --> 00:53:01,680
Now sometimes you might tell someone you shouldn't 
joke around about job loss. So maybe somebody is  

360
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:09,180
making comments about other people losing their 
jobs and they're not taking it very seriously. But  

361
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:15,660
you want that person to note that's inappropriate. 
That's a serious topic you shouldn't joke around  

362
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:25,800
about job loss is affected many people number 
seven to eat out. This simply means to eat in  

363
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:32,400
a restaurant. So rather than saying last 
night I went to a restaurant for dinner,  

364
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:42,360
we just simply say last night I ate out last 
night I ate out which means I ate in a restaurant  

365
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:49,800
this morning. I ate out before work. So because 
it's morning obviously we're talking about  

366
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:57,000
breakfast so you can use it for any meal of the 
day. So you might suggest to your friends if you  

367
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:04,320
want to save money, you should stop eating out you 
should stop eating out all the time. So you should  

368
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:10,380
stop eating in restaurants because of course 
it's more expensive. So this is an excellent  

369
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:16,980
phrasal verb to add to your daily vocabulary to 
sound like a native English speaker number eight  

370
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:26,220
to drum up. Now when you drum something up, 
it means you increase support or interest in  

371
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:34,200
someone or something. So let's say your company 
introduced a new product, but sales are lower  

372
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:45,420
than expected. Your boss might suggest everybody 
needs to brainstorm ways to drum up interest so to  

373
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:53,400
increase interest to drum up sales to increase 
sales. So if you put drum up before the noun,  

374
00:54:53,400 --> 00:55:00,300
it just means increase. Let's drum up 
support increase support drum up enthusiasm,  

375
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:08,640
increase enthusiasm. Number nine to speak 
up. When you speak up. It means you speak  

376
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:16,440
more loudly. So right now I'm talking at this 
volume. But maybe you could say, Jennifer,  

377
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:26,160
I'm having a hard time hearing you. Can you speak 
up? Can you increase the volume of your voice? And  

378
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:33,600
I'll say sure I can speak up and then I'll speak 
more loudly. So this is an excellent phrasal  

379
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:41,160
verb for a language learner because often you 
don't understand someone the first time and part  

380
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:48,840
of the problem might be that they're speaking 
too quietly. So you can say Can you speak up?  

381
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:58,440
Can you please speak up? Or do you mind speaking 
up and then the other person will speak more  

382
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:06,780
loudly. Number 10. To work out a problem or a 
situation this means that the problem or situation  

383
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:15,720
becomes better it improves. So let's say you're 
having a conflict with your boss, your coworker  

384
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:25,740
might say don't worry, I'm sure you'll work it 
out. Work it out. The it being the situation,  

385
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:33,660
the problem the complex, I'm sure you'll work it 
out. I'm sure it will improve. I'm sure it will  

386
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:43,320
become better. We also use this with problems in 
general not specific to complex. So let's say you  

387
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:51,420
lost a lot of money in the stock market. That's a 
problem. But your friend can say oh, don't worry,  

388
00:56:51,420 --> 00:57:00,360
I'm sure it will work out. So in this situation 
that you lost a lot of money. I'm sure it will  

389
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:07,080
all work out in the end. So that is a very 
common expression that native speakers use  

390
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:15,180
to reassure someone that a situation or problem 
or complex will improve I'm sure it will all  

391
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:21,840
work out in the end. Now you have 10 new phrasal
