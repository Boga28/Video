1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:04,240
Okay. I have to admit I'm not
really a sports fan at all,

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,360
but then the Olympic games or the
World Cup comes around and suddenly

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,400
I'm all in. And you
might feel the same way.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,120
As the Olympic games fever hits
or the World Cup final approaches.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,270
You'll probably notice that even
the most unenthusiastic sports

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,230
fans suddenly jump on the bandwagon
to discuss what's happening.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,870
So whether you suddenly find yourself
watching a sports event in English,

8
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,550
or you're talking about it with
neighbors, friends, and coworkers,

9
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,950
you might find that there are
times when you feel a bit left out,

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,500
or you're not about what's
going on because there was
some idiomatic expression

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,620
used or an exclamation that
you've never heard before.

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,620
If you don't already know I'm
Annemarie with Speak Confident English,

13
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,980
everything I do here is designed to
help you get the confidence you want for

14
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:59,700
your life and work in English. In
this Confident English lesson today,

15
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:04,090
you're going to learn 19
sports-related vocabulary and phrases

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,450
that you're likely to hear. Again,

17
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:10,770
whether you're watching the game on
TV or chatting about it with others,

18
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,011
by the end,

19
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:16,250
you'll be able to confidently express
your opinion of a game or a team,

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,970
and be able to pinpoint the feeling
associated with particular phrases

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,873
is when they're used

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,480
To help provide some
structure to today's lesson,

23
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,000
I've divided it up into five
different scenarios or phases of

24
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:37,834
a sporting event.

25
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,070
We're going to look at common vocabulary
and English faces used when your team

26
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,030
or favorite athlete is winning the
game. When there's a turn in events,

27
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,230
when your team's losing and you're
feeling discouraged or disappointed,

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,790
when it's a nail biter. And finally,

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,910
when you are describing a
particular team or athlete.

30
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:04,140
Let's start with some high energy phrases
you're likely to hear commenters or

31
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:06,700
spectators use when their team is winning.

32
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,580
Number one is to have the upper hand.

33
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,420
To have the upper hand means to have
the winning advantage or to have control

34
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,420
over someone else or
something else. For example,

35
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,780
perhaps the Dutch speeds
skating team has greater control

36
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,490
over the bends and curves of the
track. And while watching the game,

37
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:32,330
you might hear a commentator say the
Dutch team certainly has the upper

38
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,490
hand with this track. And now
phrase number two to take the lead.

39
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,490
Generally speaking to take the lead
means to take charge. For example,

40
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,410
if we use this in a business setting,

41
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,400
you might say that someone takes
the lead in the business meeting,

42
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,240
they've taken charge of
the meeting. However,

43
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,000
in most sports contexts,

44
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,480
it means to move into or
advance into first place.

45
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,520
Imagine you're watching the 100
meter final and your favorite

46
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:07,360
runner manages to move
ahead of the fastest runner

47
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,880
on the track. The moment that happens,

48
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,400
you might hear the newscaster
cry and he takes the lead.

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,440
He just might bring home the gold!

50
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,870
And now phrase number three to land it.

51
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,670
Landing something typically
refers to successfully acquiring

52
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,390
something. For example,

53
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:31,470
I was so lucky to have landed this
job before the pandemic hit. However,

54
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,870
in a sports context,

55
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,190
it means that someone was successful
in performing a particularly difficult

56
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,780
move. For example,

57
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:44,580
maybe you're a gymnastics enthusiast and
you love watching Simone Biles perform.

58
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,340
After she completes a difficult move,
you might jump up in your seat and cry.

59
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,620
She landed it.

60
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,700
And now one of my favorite expressions
on today's list to nail it or to nail

61
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:56,534
something.

62
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,130
This is an expression I love to
use when one of my students is

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,210
successful in completing a presentation
or a job interview in English.

64
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,970
I'll often exclaim, you nailed it.

65
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,330
We use this when someone does
something perfectly well.

66
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,810
And in the sports context,

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,330
when someone makes the goal
and it's a beautiful kick,

68
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,640
you might say she nailed it.

69
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,600
You'll hear that one often in
highly technical sport events,

70
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:28,200
such as figure skating,
skiing, and gymnastics.

71
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,000
Now let's move on to phrase number
five, to knock it out of the park.

72
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,080
This phrase is perfect when
you are deeply impressed

73
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,670
with someone's performance. It's precise,

74
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:46,590
meaning means to perform
beyond expectations and to
do something particularly

75
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,310
well. For example, imagine you're
watching the figure skating finals,

76
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,910
and one of the performers
leaves the entire audience

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,390
speechless. It was so beautifully done.

78
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:03,900
You might hear the commentator
or say that was unbelievable.

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,820
He knocked it out of the park.

80
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,020
Now that you have several phrases that
you're likely to hear and that you can

81
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:12,380
use when your team is
winning and you're cheering,

82
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,580
let's move on to what you can say
when there's a turn of events.

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,300
In every major sporting event,

84
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:23,170
there is inevitably some
surprise twists and turns.

85
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,370
It's what makes watching a sports event
so exciting. When those moments happen,

86
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,450
here's what you can say.

87
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,370
Phrase number six on our
list to throw a curve ball,

88
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:39,730
to throw a curve ball means when
a situation suddenly becomes

89
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,840
tricky or goes off the
normal or expected path,

90
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,680
something you didn't anticipate
happens. For example,

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,560
you're watching a football match and
it's getting down to the final seconds of

92
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:57,480
the game. The star player of your
team has an easy penalty shot,

93
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,320
and everybody feels calm and
relaxed because of course
he's gonna make it right,

94
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,120
but he misses. That is a curve
ball. Something unexpected happened.

95
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,240
And as a result of missing that
shot, the score stays tied.

96
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,000
And in the final seconds,

97
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,390
the other team wins that entire situation
is having a curve ball thrown in

98
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,180
the game.

99
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,070
Another phrase you might hear
when something unexpected
happens is out of left

100
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,953
field.

101
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,590
This is used when something happens
out of nowhere or unexpectedly,

102
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,630
and it takes us by surprise. For example,

103
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,380
the International Olympics Committee
recently expanded the number of sports in

104
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:42,780
the Summer Olympics. And in
discussing this decision,

105
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,500
some critics might say,

106
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:48,260
rock climbing in the Olympics
came out of left field.

107
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,820
We weren't expecting the IOC to
include that activity in the Olympics.

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,250
And now one more fantastic expression
when things take an unexpected turn:

109
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,930
to be blindsided. This
expression tends to be negative.

110
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,610
So we use it when there's a
surprise that was unexpected and

111
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,770
unpleasant. For example,

112
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,890
the athletes were completely
blindsided by the IOCs ban.

113
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,040
Now let's move on to a number three,

114
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,120
what you might hear or what you can say
when you're feeling that disappointment

115
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,800
of loss, your team or your
favorite athlete is losing.

116
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,200
Phrase number nine on our
list is to jump the gun.

117
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,200
Sometimes the anxiety of
competing can get to an athlete.

118
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,240
And as a result of that anxiety,

119
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:43,750
they may start before they're
supposed to, leading to a penalty,

120
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,030
or maybe even being
disqualified. For example,

121
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,350
maybe you're watching an intense hockey
game and while you're cheering for your

122
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,750
favorite team, they begin to
lose due to a missed pass.

123
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,220
So you might say he jumped the
gun and passed the puck too soon,

124
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,020
he should have waited. As
result of jumping the gun,

125
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,300
it may lead to phrase number
10 on our list: to fall behind.

126
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,900
When a winning streak begins to slow down,

127
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,260
or when there's a loss in rank - for
example, maybe during a track event,

128
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,500
you start out in the lead, but then,

129
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,250
and several other runners start to
catch up and get ahead of you - you

130
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,610
may fall behind. While watching
a news story about the Olympics,

131
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:32,410
you might hear something like
Great Britain was doing well,

132
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,650
but fell behind as Japan surpassed
them with four gold medals.

133
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,080
And now number 11 on our list to withdraw,

134
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,200
to withdraw means to formally
leave or back out of a competition.

135
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,340
For example,

136
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:51,760
the nation was shocked when the Simone
Biles withdrew from the Summer Olympics.

137
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,760
A similar expression that you
might hear is to drop out,

138
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,880
to drop out of the game or
to drop out of the final.

139
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,120
And now the last one on our list for
what you can say or what you might hear

140
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,120
when your team is losing is Hail Mary.

141
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,680
To attempt a Hail Mary,
to hope for a Hail Mary.

142
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,030
This is used when we hope for a recall,

143
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,070
or when an athlete attempts
to do something miraculous,

144
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,990
something absolutely
unexpected and super difficult.

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,230
Typically a Hail Mary attempt
has a very slim chance of

146
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:33,870
being successful. This expression is
deeply rooted in American football,

147
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,260
and you'll hear it often to
describe someone attempting
a particularly long pass

148
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,620
or kick. Here's an example
of how you can use it.

149
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,980
Although Sarah Davies
was close to passing out,

150
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,620
she made a Hail Mary attempt
to lift 133 kilos. Okay,

151
00:09:50,621 --> 00:09:51,860
we're getting close to the end.

152
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,130
We have just seven more sports-related
phrases to it's time for scenario

153
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,570
number four, when the
game becomes a nail-biter.

154
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,890
Let's talk about that
expression for a moment.

155
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,170
I want you to think about
physical signs of anxiety.

156
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,330
What do people do when they get nervous?

157
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,610
Some people fidget with
their hands or their feet.

158
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,720
Others might start to feel
really hot and some might start

159
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,840
to bite their nails when
they're feeling nervous.

160
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,280
A nail biter is a situation
or a TV show, a movie,

161
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,800
a game that causes great
anxiety or tension like when

162
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:37,710
there's a tie between two
teams in the World Cup final at

163
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:38,830
that precise moment,

164
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,710
when you have just a few seconds left in
the game and someone's getting ready to

165
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:46,550
take that final kick, you could describe
it as a nail biter. Phrase number

166
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,350
14 on our list also can
lead to a nail biter

167
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,990
situation to be down to the wire.

168
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,620
Down to the wire means until
the very last second or coming

169
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,580
very close to the end. During the
last few moments of a sporting event,

170
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,740
you might hear commentators say,
we're coming down to the wire,

171
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,060
but team USA just might pull
through. In other words,

172
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:18,250
there are just a few seconds
left and in those final seconds,

173
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,810
that particular team may
advance ahead and ultimately win

174
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:25,370
the game. Similarly,

175
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,010
when someone enters that final
lap in a pool or their final

176
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,810
round around the track, we can say
that they're on the home stretch.

177
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,650
For example, while watching
your favorite swimmer,

178
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,080
you might say she's in the home stretch
and she just needs a few more seconds

179
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,320
of giving it her all to win the gold.

180
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,400
But sometimes in those final
moments of the home stretch,

181
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,080
two players may be neck and neck,

182
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,360
this means that they're
extremely close or even equal.

183
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,773
For example,

184
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,520
Shericka Jackson and Marie-Josee
Ta Lou were neck and neck in the

185
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,080
semi-final. And now we're
down to our last scenario.

186
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,240
Scenario number five is when you want
to describe an athlete or a team.

187
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,870
And we have just three phrases left.

188
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,750
Number 17 on our list is the underdog.

189
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,510
When a team or a player
is underrated and no one

190
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,150
anticipates that they will win, they
may be described as an underdog.

191
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,350
And if that team or player
does win in the end,

192
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,300
you may hear someone say "coming
into this event, she was an underdog,

193
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,060
but she truly is a champion."
Number 18, the dream team.

194
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,660
I'm sure you can imagine
what this expression means.

195
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,300
If your favorite team has proved
to have finesse and to work

196
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,330
extremely well together, win the game.

197
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,450
You might describe them as the dream team.
For example, with Klay Thompson back,

198
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,170
the Golden State Warriors have
been reinstated as the dream team.

199
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,410
And now it's time for our last
phrase on the list. Number 19,

200
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,970
hands down.

201
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,880
Whether it's the underdog
who became victorious or your

202
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,480
dream team that was ultimately successful.

203
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,840
You may explain that
your team is, hands down,

204
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:24,640
the best team.

205
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:30,000
Hands down means that something
or someone is exactly as

206
00:13:30,001 --> 00:13:34,950
you describe without question
in talking about your athlete

207
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:35,930
on a team,

208
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,430
you might say she is hands down the best

209
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,670
player on the team. With that

210
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:47,270
you have 19 sports-related phrases you
can use the next time you're watching

211
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,310
a major sporting event on TV.

212
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,750
Now today's lesson is by no
means an exhaustive list.

213
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,620
There is a endless number of phrases,

214
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,860
idioms and frail verbs we use while
watching a favorite sporting event on

215
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:07,540
TV. And there may be a few that you
already know of and that you love.

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,220
If you have a favorite expression
that I did not use today,

would love to know what it is.
