1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,160
If you avoid using some English grammar
tenses because you're not really sure

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:07,440
how to use them or why you should,

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,000
it can lead to unnecessary
grammar mistakes.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,680
It can also make it far more difficult
to say exactly what you want to

5
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:21,160
say in English conversations. In
today's Confident English lesson,

6
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:25,880
we're going to do an in-depth
exploration of the past continuous

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,800
tense in English, also known
as the past progressive.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,240
This means we'll review the past
continuous structure so that you use them

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,840
accurately and more importantly,

10
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:41,840
you'll learn six real-life
examples of when to

11
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:46,120
use the past continuous. What that means
is by the end of this lesson today,

12
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,000
you'll be a hundred percent ready to
confidently answer three questions I

13
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:54,720

continuous tense in English.

23
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,200
Before we look at six specific
examples of when to use the past

24
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:47,360
continuous form,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
let's focus on the structure so
that you're able to use this tense

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,280
accurately. In the positive form,

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,320
we have a subject and then the
past form of the verb to be was

28
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:04,800
or were followed by an
I N G verb. For example,

29
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,280
I was planning to call you,
but I lost track of time.

30
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,800
Then in the negative form,
once again, we have a subject.

31
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,919
The past form of the to be verb
- was or were - followed by

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,280
not and an I N G verb. For example,

33
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,240
she wasn't sleeping when you called.

34
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,680
She was working with her
phone on do not disturb.

35
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,040
In addition to making sure
the structure is accurate,

36
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,040
it's also important to be
careful with your word choice.

37
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,680
We don't use stative verbs
in the past continuous

38
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,234
form.

39
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,200
Stative verbs are used to describe
a state of mind or a state of

40
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:51,840
being. These are verbs, such
as believe, like, dislike,

41
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,160
hate, love, need, prefer, realize,

42
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:00,560
seem, understand or want. For example,

43
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:05,320
we would not say when I was
younger I was preferring to

44
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,960
drink coffee that doesn't work in
English. Instead, we would say,

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,200
when I was younger, I
preferred to drink coffee.

46
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,560
Stative verbs imply continuous

47
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,840
or ongoing action,

48
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,240
so the use of the past progressive form,

49
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:26,760
which can also imply continuous
or ongoing action in the past

50
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,200
is unnecessary. With all of that in mind,

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,480
let's get into six real-life
examples of how and when to use

52
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,000
the past continuous in English.

53
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,720
The first use is to provide
background or context when telling

54
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:45,600
stories. Of course, when you tell a story,

55
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,800
you are referencing the past.

56
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:52,640
You're talking about something
that already happened,
something you experienced,

57
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,920
and to help make a story more
interesting. You provide context,

58
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,000
in other words,

59
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,880
the background to help set the
tone of the story or to create a

60
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:09,840
mood. Doing all of this creates a
mental picture for your listener.

61
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:14,040
This is when we use the past
continuous tense for telling stories.

62
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,920
Let me give you an example.

63
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,640
Imagine you're telling someone
about a recent vacation and to

64
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:24,920
highlight just how relaxing it
was from the very first day,

65
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,920
you might share some background details.

66
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,120
What was happening the moment you
woke up that first day in telling

67
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:37,400
your vacation story, you might say,
the very first morning I woke up,

68
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,720
the waves were gently rolling up on shore.

69
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,120
The sun was just inching
up over the mountains,

70
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:48,360
warming the sun and the palm
leaves were rustling in the breeze.

71
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,440
It was the perfect start to my vacation.

72
00:04:52,339 --> 00:04:57,279
All of those background details are in
the past continuous tense and they helped

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,680
to provide context. Let's take
a look at another example.

74
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,720
Think for a moment about an important
historical event you've experienced

75
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,800
and imagine someone asking
you, what were you doing when?

76
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,120
What were you doing when you
first heard the election results?

77
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,279
In telling that story and providing
some background details, you might say,

78
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,360
I was at an election party.

79
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:28,120
A group of us were chatting and the music
was blaring when they first announced

80
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:32,040
the results, there was so much noise
that we didn't hear them right away.

81
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,640
This example leads me to use number two.

82
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:41,480
We used the past continuous to
highlight overlapping events or

83
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:45,800
interruptions. Let's start by
talking about overlapping events.

84
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,161
In other words,

85
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:52,160
when two things are happening at
the same time to show that two

86
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:56,680
events are overlapping and to
indicate which ones started

87
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:59,800
first, we use the past continuous.

88
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,240
There are two structures we typically
use to highlight these overlapping

89
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:05,900
events.

90
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,839
The first one is to use the past
continuous followed by when and the

91
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,880
past simple form.

92
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:16,800
I was chatting with friends
when they announced the results

93
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,920
or we could reverse that when
they announced the results.

94
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,320
I was chatting with friends.

95
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,520
In both cases the use of the
past continuous highlights,

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,160
which of the two events started first.

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,760
The second structure we can
use is to include a specific

98
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:41,400
indication of time that
highlights something was

99
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,480
happening before and after. For example,

100
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,160
at midnight at 7:00 PM in September

101
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,720
by the age of 12.

102
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:57,320
Let me give you a few examples of how
we might use these indications of time.

103
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,480
Number one, by the age of 12,

104
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,360
I was playing concerts in major
cities around the country.

105
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,880
This tells us the statement was
true before and after that specific

106
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:12,520
indication of time. A second example,

107
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,840
by the time I was in my mid thirties,

108
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,840
I was already putting away a
significant portion of my paycheck

109
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:24,000
toward my retirement
savings, and number three,

110
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,800
I was cooking dinner at
7:00 PM last night. Again,

111
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:33,880
this highlights that you were
cooking dinner before and after that

112
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:38,120
period of time, and now let's
talk about interruptions.

113
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,241
The past,

114
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:44,200
continuous shows what was
happening when an interruption

115
00:07:44,201 --> 00:07:45,880
occurred. For example,

116
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:50,800
imagine you missed an important call
from a loved one and when they finally

117
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:54,720
reach you, they want to know what was
going on. Why didn't you answer the phone?

118
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,960
In your response, you might say,

119
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,800
I was cooking in the kitchen and the
kids were watching TV at full volume.

120
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,040
When you called, I didn't hear
the phone. In another example,

121
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:10,800
perhaps you've had a chaotic
morning and in describing

122
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:14,480
this entire morning to a coworker,
you might include this detail.

123
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,840
The kids were sleeping deeply
when the alarm rang and jolted

124
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:23,000
them awake. Before we
move on to use three,

125
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,160
I want you to look again at those
examples with interruptions and notice

126
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:32,559
that we're using that same structure
we used with overlapping events.

127
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:36,880
We're using the past, continuous
with when and the past simple.

128
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,480
Use number three is to emphasize a length

129
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,240
of time such as all day or all afternoon.

130
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,360
Now, why might it be useful or
important to emphasize a length of time?

131
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,880
Let me illustrate with an example.

132
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,080
Imagine you've recently accomplished
a major milestone at work.

133
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,120
You and your team have just
finished an all-consuming project

134
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,200
and do you want to emphasize how
much time you've spent on it,

135
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,400
the past continuous combined with
phrases that explain the length of time

136
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,480
help you do this In describing this
effort to others, you might say,

137
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,720
we were working on this
project nonstop all year.

138
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,960
It's hard to believe it's finished.

139
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,400
In addition to using a phrase such
as all year, you could use all day,

140
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,120
all night, all month,
all week, all morning,

141
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,240
all afternoon, all evening.

142
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,000
You could also use for
hours, for days, for weeks,

143
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,920
for months, for years.

144
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,640
Here's another example many
parents might identify with.

145
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:55,280
Imagine being a new parent
and telling a friend just how

146
00:09:55,281 --> 00:10:00,200
difficult it was to get good sleep
last night in that conversation,

147
00:10:00,201 --> 00:10:03,600
you might say it was a terrible night.

148
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:07,120
She was crying all night
and we hardly slept.

149
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,230
The fourth use of the past continuous
tenses on this list today is to discuss

150
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,390
past habits using words such as always,

151
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,710
and usually now you might
be thinking Annemarie,

152
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,270
I thought we used the present simple
to talk about habits, and you're right,

153
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:30,190
we do. If there is a habit I currently
have, I would use the present simple.

154
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,150
For example, I always read before bed,

155
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,470
but what if a habit is no longer true?

156
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,230
Perhaps you've broken a bad habit
or maybe you grew out of one.

157
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,230
This is where the past
continuous is helpful.

158
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:50,230
It tells us about a past
habit that is no longer true.

159
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,713
To do this,

160
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,870
we use the past continuous form
combined with adverbs and adverb.

161
00:10:56,871 --> 00:11:00,870
Phrases that describe
frequency such as always,

162
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,150
constantly, usually, rarely, all the time,

163
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,110
the entire time. For example,

164
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:13,870
imagine you're reminiscing about
your first year in your current

165
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:17,910
job. While you reflect on
that time, you might say,

166
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:22,790
during my first year I was
constantly making mistakes.

167
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,470
There was so much to learn.

168
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:30,070
You could also use the past continuous
tense combined with an indication of

169
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:34,309
frequency to describe
some annoying past habits.

170
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,350
For example, in describing where
you used to live, you might say,

171
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,550
the entire time we lived
in that neighborhood,

172
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:47,590
our neighbors were constantly
yelling and partying every other

173
00:11:47,591 --> 00:11:49,150
night. In the end,

174
00:11:49,151 --> 00:11:52,550
we decide to sell the house and move
to a more peaceful neighborhood.

175
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,200
Our fifth use of the past continuous
form is in making a polite

176
00:11:58,201 --> 00:12:00,360
request using the structure.

177
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,040
I was wondering if in
using this highly polite,

178
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,400
indirect way of making a request,

179
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:10,960
we're using the past continuous form.

180
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,440
We tend to use this structure
when we want to be overly polite

181
00:12:16,441 --> 00:12:20,800
because we're worried someone
will say no. For example,

182
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,080
if you're asking a friend
for a favor and you say,

183
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,880
I was wondering if we could
borrow your truck for our move,

184
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:32,200
or if you're inviting a coworker to
your house for the very first time,

185
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,400
you might say,

186
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,000
I was wondering if you're
free this weekend we're
having a few friends over for

187
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,679
a backyard barbecue. We'd
love for you to join us.

188
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,160
You can also use this structure
without the word if to ask

189
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,600
indirect questions.

190
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,200
This is useful when you're not
sure if a question is appropriate.

191
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,280
For example, I was wondering
what you're doing this weekend.

192
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,130
A direct way of asking that question
is, what are you doing this weekend?

193
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,970
Another example is we were wondering
when you'll have a decision,

194
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,570
A direct way of asking that is simply
when will you have a decision? Now,

195
00:13:11,571 --> 00:13:14,650
as I said, this structure
can be a very polite,

196
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,970
indirect way of making requests,

197
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,330
but it's important not to overuse it.

198
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,890
This structure of I was
wondering if is considered

199
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:27,890
vague language,

200
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,010
vague language can be difficult to
understand and it can make your meaning

201
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,153
less clear.

202
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,320
The last use of the past continuous
form on this list today is to indicate

203
00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:41,800
a change of mind.

204
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,880
Have you ever made a plan and then
changed your mind at the last minute?

205
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,360
Of course you have. We've all done that.

206
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,960
The past continuous helps to
identify what our original plan was

207
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,280
and what we decided in
the end. For example,

208
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:02,240
imagine you made plans to move
to another city at some point in

209
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:03,080
time. In the past,

210
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:07,600
originally you were thinking
of moving to one specific city,

211
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,760
but in the end you changed your mind
and decided to move somewhere else.

212
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,320
In talking through that
process, you could say,

213
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,920
I was planning to move to
Washington DC originally,

214
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:22,880
but in the end I decided to
move to New York. Similarly,

215
00:14:22,881 --> 00:14:26,480
let's say that you're talking to
someone about your upcoming plans for a

216
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,513
vacation.

217
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,320
In the process of planning the
cost of airline tickets and long

218
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:36,160
delays at airports changed
your original plans,

219
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,200
you might tell your friend,

220
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,760
we were originally planning to go back
to Europe because we haven't been in

221
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,140
years,

222
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:48,040
but the cost of airline tickets and
the long delays changed our minds.

223
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,040
We decided we'll go
somewhere closer to home.

224
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,680
Now that you have these six
clear uses of the past continuous

225
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,760
form in English, it's time to practice.
I have three questions for you.

226
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,600
I want you to answer these three
questions using the past continuous

227
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,800
question. Number one, think
about your last vacation.

228
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,520
What was the first day like?

229
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,160
Share some contextual or background
details about your vacation.

230
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,113
Question number two,

231
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,520
what was a past habit that
you broke or grew out of?

232
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,080
You can use a sentence structure
such as when I was a kid.

233
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:33,040
I constantly, I always, I usually,

234
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:38,360
and then continue with the past continuous
form. And then question number three,

235
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,480
tell me about a time when
you changed your mind.

236
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,840
What was your original plan and what
did you decide? In the end, as always,

237
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:51,280
you can share your answers to those
questions with me in the comments below.

238
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,960
If you found this lesson helpful to you,

239
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,960

tell me in one super simple way.

240
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,480
