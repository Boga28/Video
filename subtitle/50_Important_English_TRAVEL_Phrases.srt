00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,720
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. 
Let's travel together.  

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,440
Do you like to travel? Do you wish that you 
could travel more? Well, if you have ever  

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,640
visited another country, you know that English 
is essential or at least very helpful when you  

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,360
travel. So, I have some good news. Today, you are 
going to learn 50 important phrases for travel.  

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,840
You'll learn how to plan for a trip, how to talk 
about directions and transportation, how to talk  

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,400
at the airport and at a hotel. And finally, how 
to tell someone about a trip that you just took. 

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,640
I know that 50 expressions is a lot. So, to 
help you, I've created a free PDF worksheet  

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,360
that you can download with the link in the 
description. Never forget what you've learned,  

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,760
review everything and answer Vanessa's Challenge 
question at the end of the PDF worksheet. 

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,080
Let's get started with how to 
plan or book a trip in English.  

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,960
Where would you like to go? Excellent starter 
question. Where would you like to go? Also,  

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:21,520
you can answer this by saying, "I've never been 
to Rio de Janeiro. I've never been to Rome.  

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:30,160
I've never been to Tokyo." Excellent phrase.
"We should book tickets now." This verb, to book,  

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,720
means to reserve. We're not talking about 
something that you read. This is the noun,  

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,800
a book. This is talking about reserving something. 
"We should book tickets now because it's a  

16
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,360
popular destination, so let's book tickets."
"I hate making plans. Let's just do something  

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,600
spur of the moment." Spur of the moment 
means without plan, something spontaneous.  

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,720
Well, you need to book tickets to go to another 
country, but maybe when you get there, you don't  

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,720
want to have every hour planned. You like to do 
things spur of the moment. "Oh, there's a great  

20
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,320
park. Let's go there. Oh, that's a cool museum. 
Let's go there." This is spur of the moment. 

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:16,880
A similar phrase you can use is, "We decided 
that we'll just go wherever the wind blows us."  

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,040
Maybe the wind will blow me to that museum. 
Maybe the wind will blow me to that restaurant.  

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,280
I don't know. This has the same idea as spur of 
the moment. It's not planned. It's spontaneous. 

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,680
Maybe you are the opposite kind of person. You 
might say, "We need to make a reservation."  

25
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,560
This is a great phrase to know: to make a 
reservation. You can make a reservation at a  

26
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,800
popular restaurant, you can make a reservation 
at a hotel, you can make a reservation for a  

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,360
seat at a concert. There's a lot of different 
things that you can make a reservation for. 

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,600
When you go to a museum or somewhere similar, 
you might ask, "Do you have an audio guide?  

29
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,040
Do you have an audio guide?" This is actually a 
great way to improve your English. Because if you  

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,000
listen to an audio guide in English, 
as you're walking around the museum,  

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,760
I bet you are going to learn a ton of new 
vocabulary, some great expressions for describing  

32
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,360
what you're seeing. This is an excellent way to 
enjoy something, but also learn some English.  

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,480
You can ask, "Do you have an audio guide?"
When you go somewhere, you can ask, "Do you  

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,440
accept cash or credit card? Do you accept cash or 
credit card?" Depending on the country you're in,  

35
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,920
they might prefer one option instead of the other. 
And we often use the word cash to talk about  

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,840
physical dollar bills or the physical 
money of the place that you're visiting.  

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,840
"Do you accept cash or credit card? Because I only 
have a credit card. I don't have any cash with me.  

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,200
If you need cash, then I got to come back."
You might ask, "What are the hours for the  

39
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,720
museum? What are the hours for the tour? What are 
the hours for some kind of event or place?" It's  

40
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,000
a great question to ask, "When are you open?" What 
are the hours for something that you want to see? 

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,920
Our final question under this first category of 
planning or booking your vacation is an excellent  

42
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,600
question, "What should I pack for? What should 
I pack for?" Well, of course, for vacation. Now,  

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,880
this question has another meaning. It means I 
want to know what kind of activities we'll do,  

44
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,880
what the weather is going to be. I want 
to know, do I need to pack a swimsuit?  

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,480
Do I need to pack a winter coat? What should I 
pack for? That means what should I prepare for? 

46
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,200
This is really helpful as you're trying to 
fit everything inside your small suitcase,  

47
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,800
this always happens to me, and you really need 
to decide, "Okay, what do I need to pack four?  

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,360
Okay, I don't need three winter sweaters. 
It's probably going to be not too cold.  

49
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,600
I'll just bring something else." You 
can ask, "What do I need to pack for?" 

50
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,320
The next phrases have to do with transportation 
and directions. I want to help you not be lost in  

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,560
a foreign place with no words to say to help 
yourself. So, let's talk about 10 important  

52
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
phrases for transportation and directions.
The first one is a great question. You can  

53
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,320
ask someone else or they might ask you, 
if you look really lost, you might hear,  

54
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,560
"Where are you headed?" This is often reduced to 
simply, "Where ya headed?" We cut out the verb  

55
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,640
are and we reduced you to ya, "Where ya headed? 
Where are you headed?" If you look really lost,  

56
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,000
someone might say, "Hey, where ya headed? 
Can I help you?" This great verb, to head,  

57
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
means the direction that you're going in. 
So, you're going somewhere. "I'm headed to  

58
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,840
the store. I'm headed to the doctor's office. 
I'm headed to the metro station. Where is it?" 

59
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,200
So, someone might ask you, "Where ya headed?" 
Or, if you see someone who's lost, you can ask  

60
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,440
this too, "Excuse me. Can you tell me how to 
get to the metro station? Excuse me, can you  

61
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,360
tell me how to get to the subway station?" It's 
great to introduce a lot of these questions with,  

62
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,040
"Excuse me," because you're interrupting someone 
else and really it is the easiest way to be polite  

63
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:20,000
in a simple way. "Excuse me, can you tell me how 
to get to the subway station? Excuse me, can you  

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:28,000
tell me how to get to the museum?" To wherever 
you'd like to go. "Excuse me, how far is it to the  

65
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,120
airport? Excuse me, how far is it to the airport?"
You might ask this to your bus driver as you're  

66
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,600
getting on the bus to go to the airport and you're 
worried about missing your flight. You'd want to  

67
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,000
know, is it going to take 30 minutes? Is it going 
to take two hours? Is it going to take 10 minutes?  

68
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,080
"Excuse me, how far is it to the 
airport?" And then they'll tell you,  

69
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,680
"Oh, don't worry. It's just going to take 
10 minutes. We'll be there pretty soon." 

70
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,120
I don't know about you, but I have had many 
experiences looking for a bus stop and being  

71
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,840
so lost. Sometimes bus stops are not obvious. It's 
just a little sign or maybe it's just a pole and  

72
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,920
everyone knows where you should go, except 
for you because you're not from that area.  

73
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,720
So, this is a great question. You can ask, 
"Excuse me, which way to the bus stop?  

74
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,480
Excuse me, which way to the bus stop? 
This way, that way, over here, back  

75
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,120
there?" "Excuse me, which way to the bus stop?"
"Excuse me, where's the closest ATM?" This phrase,  

76
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,240
ATM, stands for Automated Teller Machine. And it's 
just that machine, some other countries call these  

77
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,160
cash points where you can put your debit card 
or credit card into the machine and you can get  

78
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,840
cash. So, if you happen to go to a store 
that requires cash, but you have no cash,  

79
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,480
you can ask this question, "Oh, do you 
know where's the closest ATM?" "Excuse me,  

80
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,600
where's the closest ATM. I need to get some cash." 
Great question. And the word ATM is most commonly  

81
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,880
used in the US. Some other countries might use 
other expressions, but if you're visiting the US,  

82
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,520
ATM is an excellent word to use.
Are you hungry? You can ask,  

83
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,320
"Is there a grocery store nearby? I don't 
want to go to another expensive restaurant.  

84
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,680
I just want to get some simple food that I can 
cook back at my place. Is there a grocery store  

85
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,000
nearby?" Notice the pronunciation of this 
word. There's two pronunciations. Actually,  

86
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,640
you can say grocery, grocery with an S, grocery. 
But you're more likely to hear, at least that's  

87
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:39,840
what I say, you're more likely to hear it grocery, 
like an SH. Grocery, grocery, grocery store.  

88
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:47,120
"Is there a grocery store nearby?" Great question.
"When is the next train? When's the next train?"  

89
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,040
If the board with all of the train information is 
so confusing, just ask someone, "Excuse me, when's  

90
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,680
the next train?" Great. If still confused, you can 
ask, "When does the next.  leave? When does the  

91
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,200
next bus leave? When does the next train leave? 
When does the next flight leave? I need to go  

92
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:13,360
now." When does the next.  leave? Great question.
Will the departure be on time? Maybe you come from  

93
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,920
a country where things are always on time and 
you expect it to be on time, but you realize  

94
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,960
in the country that you're in right now, 
things are not on time or maybe the opposite  

95
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,480
and you need to know, "Excuse me, will the 
departure be on time?" That's important. 

96
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,520
Our final phrase for transportation and directions 
is actually kind of a two for one. Let's imagine  

97
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,000
that you're in a taxi, sometimes we call those a 
cab, and you're at your destination, but maybe the  

98
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,600
taxi driver is looking for, "Oh, where should I 
drop them?" You can use this phrase, "You can drop  

99
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,440
me here. You can drop me here." It doesn't mean 
that they're holding you and dropping you. This is  

100
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,840
shortened from, "Drop me off." To drop off someone 
means that you're driving them and they leave.  

101
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:03,200
You're dropping them off. Maybe you drop off your 
kids at school every morning. This is a great  

102
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,960
phrase to use in a taxi, "You can drop me here."
Or if you want to make it even shorter, you can  

103
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,520
just say, "This is me." You see your hotel out 
the window or you see the place you need to go,  

104
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,960
you can just say, "Oh, excuse me. This is me." 
Well, this is you here now. This just means,  

105
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,520
"This is where I need to go." You'll often 
hear this in a taxi and you can use it too. 

106
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:30,080
The next 10 important phrases for travel 
will help you to talk at the airport.  

107
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,160
They'll help you to speak, but also they'll 
help you to understand, because a lot of these  

108
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,880
phrases and questions, you will get asked. A 
lot of things get asked when you're traveling,  

109
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,960
when you're entering a new country. And I want to 
make sure that you can understand completely. So,  

110
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,160
let's start with the first one.
You get to the airport. You look around,  

111
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,000
there's so many people, so many things going 
on, you feel lost. Well, you can easily ask,  

112
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,880
"Excuse me, where's the Delta counter? Excuse 
me, where's the Delta check-in?" Both of these  

113
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,720
questions are great for finding where can I go 
for my airline? If you know what your airline is,  

114
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,880
and I hope you do, you can just insert that. 
"Excuse me, where's the American Airlines counter?  

115
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,760
Excuse me, where's the American Airlines 
check-in?" Excellent question to get started. 

116
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,360
After you arrive at your gate, you want to 
make sure that you don't miss your flight.  

117
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,400
Even though you're there, you're so close, but 
maybe you need to go down the hall and get some  

118
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,560
food or go to the bathroom. You need to ask, 
"Excuse me, when will the plane be boarding?  

119
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:38,000
When will the plane be boarding?" And that means: 
when will the people be going on the airplane?  

120
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,280
When will the people board? "Excuse me, when will 
the plane be boarding?" If they tell you, "Oh,  

121
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,560
we'll board in 30 minutes." Cool. You have plenty 
of time. Go get some food, go to the bathroom,  

122
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,960
stretch a little bit. Excellent question.
If you've ever been at the airport, you know you  

123
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,760
get asked lots of questions. One of those might 
be, "What's your flight number?" Especially if  

124
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:03,040
you're lost and you're not sure where to go. And 
you say, "Excuse me, I'm lost. Can you help me?"  

125
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,640
They might ask, "Oh, what's your flight number?" 
And they'll look either at your tickets or they'll  

126
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,960
look on your phone or they'll look on the board 
and they'll be able to help you not be so lost. 

127
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,920
When you're checking in, you will be asked, 
"Do you have your passport? Do you have  

128
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,720
your passport?" You might be asked a more direct 
question. They might just say, "Passport, please.  

129
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,200
Passport, please." And as long as you're familiar 
with the word passport, you know, "Aha, I need to  

130
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,920
give them my passport." Just a little note. Make 
sure that you always get your passport back. 

131
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,840
When I first traveled to another 
country, I didn't know this.  

132
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,240
And I thought that you were supposed 
to give them your passport and they  

133
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,640
kept it until you got on the flight. I don't 
know. I was a young traveler. I had no idea.  

134
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,560
So, make sure that you get your passport after 
you check in, when you enter your flight. 

135
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,280
When you go through security, 
you'll hear, "Boarding pass, please.  

136
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,640
Boarding pass, please." Or when you enter 
the airplane, they might ask you this,  

137
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,200
"Boarding pass, please." And that's the piece of 
paper that the airline has printed out, and it has  

138
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,720
all of your information, your flight number, your 
seat, all of this stuff is on your boarding pass. 

139
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,000
You'll also hear the question, 
"Are you checking any luggage?"  

140
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,120
Or, "Do you have anything to check? Are 
you checking any luggage?" It doesn't mean  

141
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm checking luggage. No, this means that 
you are giving the airline a big suitcase  

142
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,880
and they will take it and put it 
under the airplane. If you do this,  

143
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,480
maybe you might need to pay extra. They need to 
probably weigh your suitcase. So, this is a good  

144
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,040
question that you will be asked, "Are you checking 
any luggage?" Or, "Do you have anything to check?" 

145
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,120
When you are returning home from your wonderful 
travels, you might be asked at the airport,  

146
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,680
"Do you have anything to declare?" To 
declare. Usually this means to speak,  

147
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,280
"I declare that it's a beautiful day today," kind 
of old fashioned English to use it like that.  

148
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,680
But in a modern sense, we use this at the 
airport to mean, if you bought anything,  

149
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,680
especially anything expensive on your travels, 
well, you might need to pay a specific tax  

150
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,320
to bring it back to your home country. So, 
make sure that you know, so that they don't  

151
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,040
see something in your suitcase and say, "Why did 
you not declare this $500 million diamond ring?"  

152
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,040
So, you will be asked, "Do you have anything 
to declare?" And you can say yes or no. 

153
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,960
Oftentimes when you land in a new country, for 
example, if you land in New York City, they  

154
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,880
might ask you, "Is this your final destination? 
Is New York your final destination?" If you're  

155
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,560
going to Chicago, you could say, "No, I have a 
connecting flight. I have a connecting flight."  

156
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:49,200
Or maybe your flight is late, so you might say, 
"I missed my connecting flight." That's always  

157
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,760
really annoying because you're going to have to 
figure something out. Spend time on the phone,  

158
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,480
spend time at a counter, talking to someone. But 
it's a good question to understand, and to be able  

159
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,800
to answer, "Is this your final destination?" 
"Yes." Or, "No, I have a connecting flight." 

160
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,800
So, you finally land in your destination and you 
need to get your luggage. But what if you can't  

161
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:18,320
find it? What can you ask? That's a great 
question. You can ask. "Excuse me, can you tell  

162
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,360
me where baggage claim is? Excuse me, can you tell 
me where luggage claim is?" Both of these words:  

163
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,240
luggage claim and baggage claim are both used 
interchangeably. And it's a great question to ask  

164
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,400
if you're trying to find your suitcase. "Excuse 
me, can you tell me where baggage claim is?" 

165
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,560
When you go through customs, you will probably 
be asked this coming question, "Are you traveling  

166
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,920
for business or pleasure? Are you traveling 
for business or pleasure?" And that means,  

167
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,440
"Are you coming here because of work or are you 
coming here just for the fun of traveling?" This  

168
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,640
is also a question that a fellow traveler might 
ask you. Maybe when you sit down on the airplane,  

169
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:02,080
your seat mate might ask you, "Hey, are you 
traveling for business or pleasure? Why are you  

170
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,200
going to Chicago?" Maybe they'll ask you, maybe 
they won't. But it's a common question, especially  

171
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,400
in customs, "I'm traveling for business." 
"No, I'm just traveling for pleasure." Great. 

172
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:18,640
The next 10 important phrases for travel are at 
the hotel to help you speak naturally and have the  

173
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,920
right words to use when you get to your hotel. The 
first one is when you first arrive at the hotel,  

174
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,200
you need to check in. So, you can say, "Hello. 
I have a reservation for Prothe." That's my  

175
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:35,440
last name. Or you might say, "Hello, checking 
in for Prothe." Whatever your last name is,  

176
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,480
you can insert it here. That's when you come up 
to the counter or maybe you call in, in advance,  

177
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,480
depending on what that hotel does. You can use 
this phrase, "Hello? I have a reservation under  

178
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,640
Prothe." Or, "Hello. Checking in 
for Prothe." You can use either  

179
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,480
one of these phrases and both are perfectly fine.
"Is there somewhere I can print my boarding pass,  

180
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,240
bus tickets?" Et cetera. This is a great 
travel tip. Most hotels have a business room  

181
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,359
that has a printer, and most guests can use this 
for free. So, if you need to print anything,  

182
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,919
print a boarding pass, ticket, something 
like this, just ask the hotel this question,  

183
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,720
"Is there somewhere I can print my boarding 
pass?" And there probably is. Great. 

184
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,360
If you arrive late, you're super hungry, 
you can ask someone at the front desk,  

185
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,680
"Is there a good restaurant nearby? Is there a 
good restaurant nearby?" Don't feel hesitant to  

186
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,200
use the staff who works at the hotel for some 
advice. They really know about the area where  

187
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,320
you're living, especially that specific area close 
to the hotel. They might know, "Oh yeah, there's  

188
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,960
a good restaurant just two blocks over. Make sure 
you check it out. You don't need to take the bus  

189
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,400
and it's open late at night. Go check it out."
You might ask, "Can I get some more towels?  

190
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
Can I get some more pillows? Can I get some 
more blankets?" These are all polite questions  

191
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,840
and perfectly reasonable at a hotel.
"Do you have a map? Do you have a map?"  

192
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,360
Most hotels have a map and they will be more than 
happy to help you find your way around the city.  

193
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,320
And they often have free maps that you can 
use to find your way around, "Excuse me,  

194
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,680
which way to the elevators?" This is especially 
helpful if you have a lot of luggage and you don't  

195
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,320
want to go down one hallway and then try another 
and pull your luggage everywhere, or maybe you're  

196
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,200
just tired. It's the end of the day. You're not 
thinking straight. You just traveled 24 hours  

197
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,320
from your home country to New York City. Just, 
"Excuse me, which way to the elevators?" Maybe you  

198
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,920
can't even see the sign because you're so tired. 
I just need a little help. That's totally fine. 

199
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,320
When you're booking a room, you might ask, "Can 
I get a queen bed? Can I get a double bed? Can I  

200
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,720
get two twin beds?" Depending on your sleeping 
situation, it might be helpful to be specific,  

201
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:56,640
"Well, it's going to be my husband and I, and my 
two kids. They can sleep in the same bed, but it  

202
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
might be best if they each had their own beds, so 
they don't stay up all night." So, you could ask,  

203
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,560
"Do you have a queen bed and two twin beds in 
a room?" Great. You want to be specific so that  

204
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,720
you can have the most comfortable time possible.
Oftentimes hotels in the US will have a breakfast  

205
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,960
option. It's sometimes included and sometimes 
not in your fee. So, you could ask, "Excuse me,  

206
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,880
is breakfast included? Excuse me, is 
breakfast included?" And that implies,  

207
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,400
"Is it included in the price that I already paid 
for the hotel room?" Sometimes it is, sometimes  

208
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,720
it's not, but it's a great question to ask.
Usually breakfast is not available all day,  

209
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:43,040
so you can ask, "Excuse me, what time is breakfast 
served? Excuse me, what time is breakfast served?"  

210
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,040
And when you check in, the person who's 
checking you in, they'll probably tell  

211
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:51,600
you those things in advance. But if you didn't 
catch it or maybe they just didn't mention it,  

212
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,560
these are good questions to ask so that you can 
not be too hungry in the morning when you wake up. 

213
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:02,240
Another common way to get food, while you're in 
your hotel room, is room service. You can ask,  

214
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,760
"Can I get room service, please? Can I get room 
service?" That means someone comes to your door  

215
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,160
with food that they've made in the hotel. In my 
experience, in the US this is very expensive and  

216
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,840
not always the best quality food, but in certain 
circumstances, maybe this is something you want.  

217
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,320
So, you could ask the question, 
"Can I get room service?" Excellent. 

218
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,040
Our final 10 important phrases for talking 
about your travels is to talk about your travel  

219
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,640
experiences. That this is when you have finished 
traveling and you want to explain to someone the  

220
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,760
great or terrible vacation that you just had. If 
you'd like to take these expressions to the next  

221
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,240
level, don't miss a chance to tell me about your 
city and where I should travel to in your city.  

222
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,360
In this lesson, you'll get a chance to practice 
speaking with me and tell me about where you live. 

223
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,640
The first important phrase for talking about 
where you just went is to ask this question,  

224
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,320
"Have you ever been to Paris? Have you ever 
been to LA?" When you're telling someone about  

225
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,520
your trip, you want to see if they've had 
a similar experience. Great question to ask  

226
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,120
if they say, "Oh, no, I've never 
been to LA, but I would love to."  

227
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,000
What a good chance to give them some tips 
or advice about good things that you did,  

228
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,400
maybe things they should avoid. And they might 
be interested to hear what you have to say. 

229
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,600
You might hear the question, "What 
was your favorite thing about  

230
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,920
LA? What was your favorite thing about Paris?" 
Well, you can ask this question to someone else,  

231
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,880
or they might ask you that, and it helps to 
kind of prompt a conversation about where you  

232
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,680
just went. If someone just heard that you went 
to Paris, the first question they might ask is,  

233
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,440
"Did you see the Eiffel Tower?"
Of course, everyone who goes to Paris sees the  

234
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,640
Eiffel Tower. Why not? It's amazing. Every time 
that I've seen it, even though it's been hundreds  

235
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,200
of times because I used to live in Paris, it's 
always amazing. I still love it. But there are  

236
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:06,880
often places that are not touristy that you enjoy. 
So, you could use this phrase, "My favorite places  

237
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,520
are off the beaten path. I love finding new places 
to visit." So, "Yes, the Eiffel Tower is great,  

238
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,880
but I love to find places off the beaten path."
The beaten path is where your feet are beating  

239
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,480
down the path. There's so many people, everyone 
is visiting the Eiffel Tower, but over here,  

240
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,880
there's a hidden cathedral that's so beautiful 
and no one visits. But right beside it,  

241
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,920
there's a little hot chocolate restaurant, "You 
have to go there. It's off the beaten path." 

242
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:44,640
On the same note, you might say, "There's so 
many hidden gems in Paris, you could spend  

243
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:53,680
years discovering them all." Hidden gems. A 
gem is like a diamond or a ruby. These kinds  

244
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,320
of precious stones. And we can use this 
in a more figurative way to talk about  

245
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,560
an amazing place, especially somewhere that's 
hidden, "There's so many hidden gems around  

246
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:10,160
the city. It's an excellent place to visit."
On the other hand, what happens when everyone  

247
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:17,040
is there? Well, you might say, "That city used to 
be nice, but now it's just a big tourist trap."  

248
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,640
Have you ever been to Venice? Venice is 
beautiful. It's so cool. But now it has  

249
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,760
kind of turned into a tourist trap. All of the 
shops, all of the restaurants, all the activities  

250
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:39,120
are only for tourists. It's kind of lost that 
livable feeling. And I don't know if that's  

251
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,600
just something that's inevitable, it's going 
to happen no matter what, or if it's something  

252
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,600
that can be prevented, but that's the way it is. 
It's kind of a tourist trap. Still worth visiting,  

253
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,760
in my opinion. But it's a tourist trap.
When I was 18 years old, I went on a road trip  

254
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,480
with my best friend and we drove for three days. 
In the US, it's extremely common to go on a road  

255
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,000
trip. We don't have great public transportation. 
There's not trains that go all over the US in an  

256
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,160
easy way. So, instead, we drive and we often take 
a road trip. This is a common form of vacation  

257
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:22,240
in the US, maybe in your country too. Do 
you ever take road trips for a vacation? 

258
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,680
The next phrase for travel is one that 
you might see more often in writing than  

259
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,080
in spoken conversation, but I want to make sure 
you can understand it. It is, "I need some R&R."  

260
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,920
And it's often used with the symbol &, 
and a capital R and another capital R.  

261
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:50,640
This does not mean railroad because sometimes RR 
means railroad. This means rest and relaxation. 

262
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,720
So, if you're feeling super stressed and 
you're just texting with your friends saying,  

263
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,240
"I think I'm going to go on vacation next week. 
I need some R&R." We don't often say that,  

264
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,600
"I need some R&R." But you might write that in 
a text or write that in a message to talk about,  

265
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,680
"I just need to take a break. I need some R&R."
If you need some R&R, you don't want to take  

266
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:18,880
a whirlwind trip. I have done this. It is very 
hectic. It means that you visit a ton of places in  

267
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:25,920
a short period of time or you see a ton of things 
in a short period of time. It's a whirlwind. 

268
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,480
When my husband and I visited Thailand, we 
only had four days, I think. And we visited  

269
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,760
Bangkok for a couple of days. And then we took 
a train, a bus, a taxi, and then another bus  

270
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,600
to the south of the country, to the beach. And 
then we did the same thing to go back to Bangkok,  

271
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,080
to fly back to where we were living in Korea. It 
was a whirlwind trip. I wish we had more time. And  

272
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,560
someday I'd love to go back and spend a month, two 
months just exploring the country in a little bit  

273
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,760
more of a slow pace. That would be amazing.
When you travel somewhere far away,  

274
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,120
you might use this phrase, "I'm so 
tired. I'm still suffering from jet lag."  

275
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,480
Jet lag. It's one of the worst things 
when you travel. If you travel far away,  

276
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,280
maybe the morning for you is the night where 
you're traveling to. You need some time  

277
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,560
to recover. Your body needs some time to not 
feel tired, to realize what time of day it is. 

278
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:31,120
It's something we don't often think about when we 
travel to another place that's far away. At least  

279
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,560
I don't often think about until I get there and 
realize, "Oh no, it's the morning. I haven't slept  

280
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,840
for two days. I have to wait another 12 hours 
before I sleep." You are suffering from jet lag. 

281
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,800
Our final phrase is an excellent one to conclude 
talking about your travels. And that is, "I can't  

282
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:57,440
wait to go back. I can't wait to go back." If you 
had an excellent time, if you're dreaming about  

283
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,160
it, you can say, "I can't wait to go back."
Well, congratulations practicing these 50  

284
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:09,600
important phrases for travel. And now I have a 
question for you. Let me know in the comments,  

285
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,640
where would you like to go? Where is your dream 
destination? Or maybe somewhere that you've  

286
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,760
already been, and you say, "I can't wait to go 
back." Let us know in the comments. And don't
