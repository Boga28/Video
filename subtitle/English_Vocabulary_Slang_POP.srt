do you have a baby

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,560
so to pop another one out needs to have

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,360
another baby

38
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,640
they are only five bucks

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
or five dollars a pop this means they're

40
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,840
only

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,799
five dollars each so you might go to the

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,119
store and someone's like

43
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,719
how much are those they say five bucks a

44
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,800
pop you want one

45
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,239
it means they're only five dollars each

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,800
pop-up shop pop-pop shop

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,440
a pop-up shop is a store that is not

48
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,879
normally there

49
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,599
but it appears out of nowhere oh my god

50
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,040
it's a store

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,959
so to pop up means to come by surprise

52
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,400
are you surprised so a pop-up shop means

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,120
a store

54
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,840
that's only there for a short amount of

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,959
time

56
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,239
do you hate when you're watching

57
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,519
something

58
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,239
on your computer and all of a sudden an

59
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
ad comes on

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,000
they're evil evil ads so you what you

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,120
want to do

62
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,400
is you want to install a pop-up blocker

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,760
so this blocks the pop-up now

64
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,080
a pop-up means an advertising

65
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,840
advertisement and we just say

66
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,159

67
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,080
ah do you know what i want to tell you

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,760

amazing he's getting my hair

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
i have his hair and that means my father

73
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,840
so my pops actually refers to

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,760
my father do you have a father

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,120
bad subject isn't it

76
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,360
his head popped off this means that i

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,840
took my knife

78
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,040
and his head just popped right up so if

79
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,080
somebody's head pops off

80
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,120
it really doesn't just pop off means

81
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,000
that

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,159
somebody has to cut it off or slay it

83
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,680
off if

84
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,360
somebody's head pops off it just means

85
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,439
it it came off very easily

86
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,640
if you'd like that arranged call me

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,480
his eye popped out

88
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,439
do you know what that means it means

89
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,399
that somebody's

90
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,839
eyeball actually

91
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,040
came right out of his eye oh glorious

92
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,240
eyeballs

93
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,080
all over so if your eye pops out it

94
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,040
comes out suddenly

95
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
did you get what i said at the beginning

96
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,120
i said i pop a cap in your ass

97
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,320
this means i'm going to shoot you and

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
notice i said didn't say you're i said

99
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,880
yo

100
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,919
so this means you're

101
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,840
so if someone offers to pop a cap and

102
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,120
you ass

103
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,919
you should maybe maybe disagree and say

104
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,320
nah

105
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,400
you know what nah i'm good thank you

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,120
thanks no don't need it

107
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,720
he just popped him one

108
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,800
right in the eye right now right there

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,479
he's popping right in the eye

110
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,840
this mean that he punched him

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
it's very violent this english lesson

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
isn't it

113
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,639
it's very violent oh this isn't violent

114
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,919
what about my new hair color do you

115
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,880
think it pops with my skin tone

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,400
so we can say that color really pops

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,960
we talk about design you talk about

118
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
something that stands out from the crowd

119
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,440
i don't stand up from the crowd i don't

120
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,199
know why you'd say that

121
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,320
i just pop up in fun places

122
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,440
and i wear colors that pop

123
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,759
if you are scared that's the purpose

124
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,840
learning english is very scary

125
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
especially slang okay
