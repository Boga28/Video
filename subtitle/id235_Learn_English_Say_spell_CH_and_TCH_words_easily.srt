00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
Hi. I'm Ronnie, and thank you for watching
my videos. I'm here to give you a wonderful

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:18,160
video about pronunciation-yeah, I said it
right-and also spelling. So it's, like, you

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,120
watch one video, and you get two bonus videos
in one. I love these. It's, like, Boxing Day

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,800
sale or something. So, Rosie, thank you for
helping me with this, for pointing this out

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,000
to me. Love you, girl. Wow. Check this out.
I'm pretty excited about this. We have a lot

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,120
of words in English, like I said the first
time. Watch. Okay? And we spell it, W-A-T-C-H.

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,000
So if you're first learning this crazy language
called English, our little brains are, like,

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:11,400
okay, we have to say "wa", okay? W-A-T-C-H.
I am watching this video. And that's pretty

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:25,440
hard. I'm going to catch your next video,
Ronnie. I have to get a match to light this

10
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,120
candle. And this hopefully is going to be a
lot easier for you because I've got something

11
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:41,760
that's super amazingly, fantastically, wonderful,
groundbreaking. In all of these words, here,

12
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:49,120
we don't have to say the "t". So you're trying to
say "wa-tuh-chuh", "wa-tuh-chuh", "wa-tuh-chuh".

13
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,120
I am... But people don't say that. Guess what?
The "t" is silent. So it's, like, "watch".

14
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:05,160
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Okay. So "cat-tuh-chuh"
becomes "catch". I'm going to catch a ball.

15
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,039
You're going to light something for a candle,
you're going to light a match. You take the

16
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,360
"t" out, and you don't even worry about that
little guy there. The "t", he's off, man.

17
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:24,720
He's out of here. He's just, like, "See you
later, C-H. You guys do the job." Match. Snatch.

18
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,360
Snatch means to grab something quickly. It
also means "vagina" in slang, so of course

19
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,840
we have to include
"snatch" on the board. No "t".

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,840
"Stitch", we don't say "stih-tuh-chuh". "Stitch"
means you take a needle and a thread, and

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:50,440
you sew something. So I have to stitch-not
"stih-tuh-chuh", my shirt. "Bitch", and you

22
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,760
can say that word, okay? Don't worry, I'm
going to teach you about the other word "beach"

23
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,520
later, but feel free. We don't say "bit-tuh-chuh".
"Hey, you're such a bit-tuh-chuh, Ronnie."

24
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,560
Huh, thank you, baby. "Bitch".

25
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:15,440
"Fetch". Do you have a dog or a person? "Fetch"
means I throw something, and you go get it

26
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:22,400
and bring it back to me. Now, I have a dog,
and he... I don't know what's wrong. I think

27
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,600
he's broken, actually, because ever since he
was a puppy, I would throw something, like,

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:38,320
"Go fetch", and he'd run and get it. And I'm
waiting, I'm like, "Bring it back. Come on."

29
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,400
And he's like, "No." Puts up his little paw
and goes away. I'm like, "Dude, now I have

30
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,840
to go and find where you put the ball." So,
"fetch" means you throw something, and then

31
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,560
magically someone returns it to you, unless
you're my dog, and then he's like, "Ha-ha.

32
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,920
Go get it yourself,
Ronnie." So, "fetch".

33
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,080
"Scotch".

34
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,400
Truth be told, I don't really like scotch that
much. I'll drink it because I like whiskey.

35
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,959
I prefer Irish whiskey, but scotch, we don't say
scotch. I am scotches. I like scotch whiskey.

36
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:30,080
It's just scotch. It's easier. And "witch",
the kind with the hat, right? And the broom

37
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,400
and the nose, because most people have brooms
and noses. "Witch", we don't need to say the

38
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,280
"t". So, as I was researching this, and I
thought, "Whoa, super cool. Oh my goodness,

39
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,480
it's so rad we don't need to say the 't'."
Then I thought about spelling, like, "Uh-oh.

40
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:55,840
How do people know, because we put the "t",
because the "t" is silent, oh no, how are

41
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,720
people going to know when they write, when
they're learning English, if we put a "t"

42
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:10,520
or we don't put a "t" if we don't say it?" So
then I learned a rule. I hate rules. Because

43
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,760
there are always exceptions to
them. But this one's okay so far.

44
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:24,360
So, this is our game. Okay? If we have a short
vowel sound-okay?-a short vowel sound means

45
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:33,880
the vowel does not say its own name. So, in
English, this letter is "a". We don't say

46
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:43,400
"sn-a-ge". Look at your "sn-a-ge". Okay? This
is a short vowel sound, makes an "a" sound,

47
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:59,120
so we say "snatch". All of these vowels, here,
are short vowel sounds, so they say "a", "a",

48
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:10,140
"a", "i", "i", "a", "aw", and "i". If they
were long vowel sounds, they'd say "a", "a",

49
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:19,700
"a", "i", "i", "e", "o", and "i", so we don't...
We don't say "w-i-ch". Look at the "w-i-ch"

50
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:27,540
over there. She's so wonderful. So, if it's
a short vowel sound, we have to put the "t",

51
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:35,700
but we don't say it. Okay? And this is why
I like this rule. I love this rule. Usually,

52
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,540
in English, it's like if it's a short vowel
sound, you do this; if it's a long vowel sound,

53
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:47,220
you do this. But this rule is easier because
we're like... Guess what? If it's not short,

54
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:57,060
then we just put a "ch". And when I tell you that
something's not short, I mean it can be a long

55
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:12,020
vowel and a consonant. So, the vowels in English,
"a", "e", "i", "o", "u"... "a", "e", "i", "o",

56
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:17,060
"u". Now, when I've said them, I'm saying them
in the long vowel sound, and the consonants are

57
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:24,580
everything that's not a vowel. So, "b", "c", "d",
"f", "g", "h", "j", "k". All of those guys that

58
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:33,380
are not vowels are consonants. So, check this
out. We have... Consonant, consonant. Uh-oh,

59
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:44,020
we have two vowels here. We don't say "b", "e",
"a", "ch". We want to, maybe some people do,

60
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:50,020
but this is actually "beach". So, this makes a
long vowel sound because we're saying the "e",

61
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:57,860
we're saying "beach". So, because it makes a
long vowel sound, we're only going to put a "ch",

62
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:04,660
we're not going to put "th". Consonant, consonant.
Consonants are easy. Same thing with this,

63
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:11,940
"reach". Okay? If you have problems with the long
vowels and the short vowels or when we have two

64
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:18,340
vowels together, check out my videos on that.
I've got a really cool technique about how to

65
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:27,780
say these words because we just say one vowel, not
two. "Roach", "peach", this is a double "e" sound

66
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:34,980
again, "poach", and "approach". Let's go through
what these words mean. So, "torch". If you have

67
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:41,460
a phone, sometimes you want a light, and sometimes
it says "flashlight", but in British English it

68
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:47,460
says "torch". So, "torch" is something that gives
you light. It can be, like, something that you

69
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:54,580
shine, or it can be fire that you carry around.
But, I mean, most of you are not out hunting

70
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:01,460
dragons at nighttime, so we don't really use
torches as much, but it's a British word for

71
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,620
"flashlight", so you could have one of those on
your phone. "Lunch". Do you know "lunch"? It's

72
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:18,580
the thing between breakfast and dinner? It's a
meal. "Beach". Okay? "Bitch". Yes. No "t". Don't

73
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,660
say the "t". So, "bitch", "beach". Make the "e"
long, here. And this word is rhymed. "Reach".

74
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:32,980
If I reach, it means I'm trying to extend to get
something. Let me reach you. Okay? "Roach". Oh,

75
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,140
two meanings for this one. If you guys like
smoking marijuana, when you get to the end of

76
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,740
your little marijuana, there's a tiny, tiny piece
left. You're like, hmm. You don't want to burn

77
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:51,940
your finger. Some people eat it, but this is
called a "roach". It's also short for the dirty

78
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:57,220
little buggers called "cockroaches". So, I don't
know, I guess people don't like saying "cock" all

79
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,180
the time, so instead of "cockroaches", we just
say "roaches". Like, oh, I've got "roaches".

80
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:09,140
Better than saying I've got "cockroaches".
So, there's no "t". "Poach". Two meanings.

81
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,580
One is if I cook something in boiling water,
I'm poaching it. So, I can poach an egg,

82
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:26,580
I can poach fish. "Poaching" as a verb is also
when you illegally hunt and kill animals. So,

83
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:34,820
people are poachers where they go into areas
and kill animals. They kill lions and stuff.

84
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:44,100
Bad poachers, but no "t". And this word,
"approach". "Approach" means I get nearer

85
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:51,780
to you, so I'm approaching the camera. So, I
hope that you've learned two things today. One,

86
00:10:51,780 --> 00:11:03,380
"if" is a "tch". I hope you learned five things,
but if it's a "tch", we don't say the "t"

87
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,660
pronunciation. Okay? And the second thing is
about our spelling. If it's a short vowel sound,

88
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:17,380
we put a "tch". If it's not a short vowel
sound, you're just going to write a "ch".

89
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:25,700
"Ch". Stay tuned for more wonderful pronunciation,
spelling, vocabulary, grammar tips from me. I'm

90
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Ronnie, and I'm going to get some lunch. Yeah,
by the beach. Mm-hmm. With my bitch. Mm-hmm.
