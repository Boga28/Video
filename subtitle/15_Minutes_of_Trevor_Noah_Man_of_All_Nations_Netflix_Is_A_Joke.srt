1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,390
- What I do when I travel
is I try to speak to people

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,100
in their accent and see
if they can catch me out.

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,300
That's one of my favorite games.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,460
Like I'd walk into a store in Edinburgh

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,360
and I'd just be like, "Good afternoon.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,567
I would like to buy a pair of shoes."

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,763
They'd be like, "Where are you from?"

8
00:00:20,867 --> 00:00:22,377
"I'm from Scotland."

9
00:00:24,927 --> 00:00:25,927
"Aye, what part?"

10
00:00:27,467 --> 00:00:28,838
"Johannesburg."

11
00:00:28,838 --> 00:00:31,671
(audience laughs)

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:34,370
When people say they
don't like immigrants,

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,560
most of the time, they're
not referring to immigrants

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,580
who look and sound like them.

15
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,190
They're talking about immigrants
who speak differently,

16
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,220
who look different, you know?

17
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,020
Cause an accent comes with a connotation.

18
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,840
You think you know if
someone is smart or stupid

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,030
because of their accent.

20
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,280
And yet the truth is an accent

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,370
is not a measure of intelligence,

22
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,750
it's just someone speaking your language

23
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,570
with the rules of theirs.

24
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,000
Accents have connotations,
we cannot deny it.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,870
Look at the French.

26
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,490
We all believe that the
French are romantic.

27
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,520
Why?

28
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,430
Because of their accent.

29
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,263
They've got that thing.

30
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,096
"Duu..."

31
00:01:06,972 --> 00:01:07,805
"Duu..."

32
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,268
"I was thinking that maybe we could duu...

33
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:17,508
How you say, afterwards,
maybe we could try to uhh..."

34
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:22,057
"Oh my God, he's so sexy, oh my God."

35
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,200
Accents determine how we see people.

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,790
Same thing happens with the Russians.

37
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:32,250
The Russians, the most
feared people on the planet.

38
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,083
Why?

39
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,960
Because of how they speak.

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,510
I don't care who you are, you cannot deny

41
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,910
that when a Russian speaks,
you are not comfortable.

42
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,743
(audience laughs)

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,047
Soon as they open their mouth.

44
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:49,050
"Yeah, go to kill you, break you."

45
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:52,507
"And destroy your family."

46
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,440
Even if they say nice things,

47
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,137
it still sounds menacing and dangerous.

48
00:01:58,137 --> 00:02:00,553
"Yeah, fluff it up with some teddy bears.

49
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:04,577
Happy Valentine's Day."

50
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:08,789
It sounds like a threat.

51
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:14,230
You must remember, I come
from an African country

52
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,840
and all over Africa,
we have traffic lights,

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,273
but we don't use them.

54
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:24,010
It's less of a command
and more of a suggestion.

55
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,973
It's not "stop!" It's "stop?"

56
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,690
It's almost like an
African traveled the world,

57
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,180
saw that other people had traffic lights

58
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,680
and then just brought them back,

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,840
but didn't know what they were for.

60
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,950
Like, the guy was just
like, "Guys, guys, guys,

61
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,160
we need to get traffic lights, ah?"

62
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,127
And people were like, "What for?"

63
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:44,305
"It's for the intersection,
it adds atmosphere."

64
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:46,370
(audience laughs)

65
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,160
I went to Bali on vacation, yeah.

66
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,700
Out in Indonesia. If you've never been,

67
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,500
make a plan and get out
there, it's an amazing place.

68
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,040
I went out with some of my friends,

69
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,860
learned a few things
about myself as a person.

70
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,770
Most important thing I learned
is somebody needs to invent

71
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,950
a TripAdvisor specifically
for Black people, right?

72
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,460
No, because just generally I find that

73
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,630
what white people wanna do on vacation,

74
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,730
is what Black people are trying to escape.

75
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,070
And not in a bad way, it's just like,

76
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,780
we want different things
out of life, you know?

77
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,560
Like my white friends are
always inviting me camping,

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,710
for instance, always.

79
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,977
Like with enthusiasm,
they will all be like,

80
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:21,800
"Trevor, you wanna go camping, dude?"

81
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,677
I'm like, "Why?"

82
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,187
"Why?"

83
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:26,020
He's like, "Dude, what do you mean why?

84
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,853
It's amazing, you're kidding me.

85
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:29,540
it's like no water, no
electricity, you know?

86
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,070
It's just like us in the great outdoors.

87
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,580
You like, you gotta like take
a dump in like in the hole,

88
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,127
in the floor or something, dude."

89
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,827
"I'm like, yeah, that was my life.

90
00:03:38,313 --> 00:03:39,430
That was me growing up."

91
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,080
You know how hard I worked
to never go camping again.

92
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,943
Every day.

93
00:03:45,943 --> 00:03:47,754
(audience cheers)

94
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:49,337
Every day.

95
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:51,457
Every day I wake up in
my bed and I'm like,

96
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:53,177
"Thank God I'm not camping."

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,210
If my family saw pictures of me camping,

98
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,740
they would be devastated.

99
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,507
My grandmother saw me out
in the woods she'd be like,

100
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:03,637
"Oh, what happened to Trevor?

101
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,350
I thought he was successful.

102
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,520
Oh, it must be the crack (cries)."

103
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,177
Before we went I asked
my friend, I was like,

104
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:15,950
"Yo, Mitch, what are we gonna be doing?"

105
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,140
And he was like, "Dude,
don't ask questions Trevor,

106
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,600
it's just gonna be a great time."

107
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,160
I was like, "Yeah, I wanna
know what the great time

108
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,600
is gonna be about."

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,830
He was like, "Dude, don't ask questions."

110
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,330
I should have asked questions.

111
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,660
Cause we had fun.

112
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,470
But the trip, like there were
a few things that were weird

113
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,850
that I wouldn't necessarily do on my own.

114
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,970
For instance, on the third
day of the trip, right.

115
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,090
We had what was planned,
was billed in our itinerary

116
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,625
as an authentic Balinese
experience, right?

117
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:46,650
That's what they call it, an
authentic Balinese experience.

118
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,140
And what they did was they
woke us up at 5:00 AM,

119
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,030
put us in a little bus and
we drove for like three hours

120
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,030
and we got there, get
off the bus, we're like

121
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,790
in the middle of it, it's
like a remote village

122
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,460
and the little tour guide
really happy, way too happy

123
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,293
for that time.

124
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:00,790
And he's just like, "Welcome, everybody,

125
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,680
are you ready for a good time?"

126
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,177
And I'm like, "Yay."

127
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,170
And so he's like, "My name is Dang Basan.

128
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,430
And I'm going to be your guide.

129
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,500
Today, you will have an
authentic Balinese experience.

130
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,670
So exciting, follow me."

131
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,810
And so we follow him and he
walks up to a little door

132
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,670
and I'm like, "Oh, okay, this
is gonna be like a temple

133
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,700
or a cave or something.

134
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,533
And he's like,

135
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,100
"Welcome ladies and
gentlemen to the real Bali."

136
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,263
And he opens the door
into somebody's house.

137
00:05:26,476 --> 00:05:28,190
This is not a museum house,
this is just a house.

138
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,780
Like someone lives there every single day.

139
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,327
He opens the door and he's like,

140
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:34,363
"This is the home of someone in Bali.

141
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,420
He eats here, he sleeps here."

142
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,699
I'm like, "Does he know we're here?"

143
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:42,800
(audience laughs)

144
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,100
Because like we didn't knock.

145
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,933
Nobody answered the door.

146
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,510
For all I know we're breaking
and entering right now.

147
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,810
We're in some weird Balinese gang.

148
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,980
I don't know how this works.

149
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,860
And as I'm about to ask
the question, he turns

150
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,080
and he's like, "Over here,
you can see the owner

151
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,020
of the house, he's in the corner."

152
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,720
And we turn and there's
a man, the whole time.

153
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,370
He was just sitting there, frozen stiff.

154
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,250
And now I'm like, "Is
this guy part of this?

155
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,930
I don't know if we should be doing this

156
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,050
or should not be doing this."

157
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,070
And Dang Basan turns to him,

158
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,242
he starts speaking to him in Balinese.

159
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,166
And he's like, (mimics Balinese)

160
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,266
He's like, "Okay, you can touch anything."

161
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,027
And so I'm like, "Oh no,
I don't think we should-"

162
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:18,530
Before I can even finish
the people in our tour group

163
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,310
were like, "Yeah, touch it all.

164
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,330
Oh my God, touch it all.

165
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,163
Oh my God.

166
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:26,800
Does he sleep here?

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,830
Oh wow, is this where he eats?

168
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,283
Oh my God, I can never do this.

169
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,500
Oh my God.

170
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,140
Excuse me, thank you
so much for having us.

171
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,760
Oh my God, I appreciate my
life so much more right now.

172
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,700
Thank you so much, this is horrible.

173
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,233
Can we take a selfie?

174
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:46,773
Thank you, are you on Instagram?

175
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll just put hashtag the man, thank you.

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,250
Oh my God."

177
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,710
This is like something culturally,

178
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,300
I'm not supposed to be doing.

179
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,530
As an African person, I should
not be in somebody's house,

180
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,950
rummaging through their life.

181
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,520
So I'm standing in the
corner really uncomfortable.

182
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,250
And the owner of the house,
he's really accommodating,

183
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,083
he's friendly.

184
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:05,330
You know, he's like, "Yes,
thank you, enjoy, enjoy,

185
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,620
thank you."

186
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,790
And then he turns and he looks at me

187
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,040
and this was one of the
most magical moments, right?

188
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,130
Because he was smiling at everyone else,

189
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,430
and his face completely
changed when he turned.

190
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,527
He was a little hospitable, he's like,

191
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:19,680
"Yes, thank you, thank you-"

192
00:07:20,877 --> 00:07:23,930
(audience laughs)

193
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,100
And with his eyes,

194
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,930
he proceeded to have the most
in-depth conversation with me

195
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,763
that I've ever had.

196
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:31,433
And it's not like the eyes
conversation was new to me.

197
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:33,440
Like you can have an eyes
conversation with anyone

198
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,890
you have a connection with, you
know what I'm talking about?

199
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,450
Like, it could be
somebody of the same race

200
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,283
when you're in public.

201
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:38,910
It could be like a husband and wife,

202
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:41,500
like wives are really good
at having eyes conversations.

203
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,220
Like they'll like shit on you hard.

204
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,700
Like you'll be in public together

205
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,407
and then you'll say something
off, you'll be like,

206
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:47,500
"If only she did that."

207
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,700
And she'd be like, "Oh hell no,

208
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,070
I cannot believe you said."

209
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,903
But it's just eyes,

210
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,280
"I cannot believe you said all of that.

211
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,250
Wait until the next, oh, you
wanna air our dirty laundry

212
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,083
out in public.

213
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,250
Oh, you're gonna see how
this is gonna end up.

214
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,240
Oh, you say this and enjoy
this moment right now.

215
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,073
Cause you know, it's over."

216
00:07:59,073 --> 00:08:01,220
And you're like, "Yeah, I
shouldn't have done that."

217
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,260
All with eyes, right.

218
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,430
That's what he did to me.

219
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,350
Cause one minute he's
smiling at everybody.

220
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,730
And then he turns and he looks
at me and just with his eyes,

221
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,777
he was like, "What are you doing here?"

222
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,010
And so with my eyes, I was
like, "Hey man, I'm sorry.

223
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,200
I didn't know this was your house.

224
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,670
They said it was an authentic experience,

225
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,503
that's why I came."

226
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,460
He's like, "Yeah,
authentic for white people.

227
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,417
You got your own poor, go
back to where you came from."

228
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,550
I said yeah, "I shouldn't be here, man.

229
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,997
I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry."

230
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,930
If you expanded your view,

231
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,870
you realized that the rise of
nationalism is taking place

232
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,159
all over the world in Austria,
in Australia, in England.

233
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,739
That was what Brexit was all about, right?

234
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,370
They made it seem like
it was about the economy,

235
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,203
but it wasn't.

236
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,680
The truth was it was fundamentally people

237
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,490
who wanted their country back.

238
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:52,403
It never went anywhere, but
they still wanted it back.

239
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,087
I saw people on the
news talking to the BBC.

240
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:57,990
"That's why I'm voting for Brexit,

241
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,460
that's why I'm voting for Brexit, right?

242
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,150
Because this bloody country
is going to the dogs, right?

243
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,180
This bloody country and
I want Britain back.

244
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,013
That's why we voting for Brexit,

245
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:07,909
because we want Britain back."

246
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:08,742
From who?

247
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:11,607
From who?

248
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,320
Britain is like 95% white.

249
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,770
Who do you want it back from?

250
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,517
People say the weirdest
things, the craziest things.

251
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:22,530
"These bloody immigrants,
they come over here.

252
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,030
They up to no good, right?

253
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,230
I hate these bloody immigrants,

254
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,737
they need to go back to
where they came from."

255
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:28,117
"But why do you hate them so much?"

256
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,330
"I'll tell you why I hate
them, tell you why, right.

257
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,930
Because they're not even
trying to be British,

258
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:32,763
that's why.

259
00:09:32,763 --> 00:09:34,300
They don't even try to be British, right?

260
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,090
They come here, they bring
their own bloody culture.

261
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,060
They bring their own food,

262
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,480
spit their own bloody languages,

263
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,673
try to take over the whole bloody place.

264
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:45,847
"Well, that sounds British to me, I mean."

265
00:09:45,847 --> 00:09:48,680
(audience cheers)

266
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,330
If there's one country, if
there's one nation in the world

267
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,053
that has no rights to
complain about immigration,

268
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,523
it's Great Britain.

269
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,920
I also understand that for me,

270
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,380
it is a little bit different, you know,

271
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,450
I have a privilege in
that I come from a country

272
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,000
where the word n***a was
never used to oppress anybody.

273
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,670
I mean, we had another word

274
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,290
'cause we have the best
racism, come on now.

275
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,357
But not that word.

276
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,100
The word we had was the
word kaffir or kafir.

277
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,460
So we had another word, same thing.

278
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,310
It's crazy to me as well sometimes.

279
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,910
You know, same racism, different word.

280
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,140
And here it means nothing, right?

281
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,500
Kafir, kafir, nothing.

282
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,565
Some people be like, "Is
that like a probiotic?

283
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:41,830
Is that what that is?"

284
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,393
Yeah, probiotic of my pain.

285
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,390
'Cause we don't have
that in our supermarkets

286
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,513
for obvious reasons.

287
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,740
No one warned me in America,
I walked down the dairy aisle.

288
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,990
I was like, "Oh, yogurt,
ice cream (screams),

289
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:57,087
this lactose is intolerant."

290
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,530
I still can't believe the
things Donald Trump says,

291
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,700
he's such a, for me, Donald
Trump is an emotional paradox,

292
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,600
I'm not gonna lie.

293
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,410
Logically I can process him.
Emotionally, I struggle.

294
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,670
On the one hand I will
admit, I wake up many days,

295
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,640
terrified at the notion
that he's president

296
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,230
of the most powerful nation in the world.

297
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,100
But I also must admit,

298
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,013
I wake up many days knowing
he's gonna make me laugh.

299
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,670
Yeah, there's terror and there's joy

300
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,120
and I don't know how to feel.

301
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,700
You know what it feels like sometimes?

302
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,560
It feels like there's a giant asteroid

303
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,943
headed towards the earth,
but it's shaped like a penis.

304
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,063
Like I think I'm gonna die,
but I know I'm gonna laugh.

305
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,810
I have the pleasure of
meeting president Obama

306
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:48,643
while he was still in office.

307
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:49,650
Probably one of the craziest experiences

308
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,899
I've ever had in my life.

309
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:53,920
(audience cheers)

310
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,160
Came out of nowhere, came out of nowhere.

311
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,700
I was at The Daily
Show, I was in my office

312
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,910
and I got a phone call
from the administration.

313
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,037
And someone on the other end was like,

314
00:12:01,037 --> 00:12:02,610
"Hi, Trevor, would you like to interview

315
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,950
the President of the United
States in the White House?

316
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,280
And I was like, "Ah, do
you ask stupid questions?"

317
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,820
It's like, of course I
wanna meet the President

318
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,653
of the United States.

319
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:11,700
Are you serious?

320
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,850
And the day finally came,
went to DC with my TV crew

321
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,560
and they set us up in a room,

322
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,660
which is literally
opposite the Oval Office.

323
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,717
We put all our cameras in place.

324
00:12:22,717 --> 00:12:24,410
And all we're doing now is
waiting for the president

325
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,243
to arrive.

326
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:27,430
So we're staring at the
door with bated breath.

327
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:29,020
And the reason we're staring
is because they don't give you

328
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,300
an exact time of the president's
arrival for his safety.

329
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,543
So they just give you a
window, like the cable guy.

330
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,070
So we're all waiting there
listening to every footstep,

331
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,120
every moment.

332
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,630
And then he just popped in behind us,

333
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,930
scared the shit out of everybody.

334
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,763
'Cause there's a secret door,

335
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:48,470
but they don't tell you,
again, for safety, right?

336
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,430
So we're staring at that door

337
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,745
and all of a sudden he was like, "Hello."

338
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:53,607
And I was like, "Ahh! (screams)"

339
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,280
But I had a great time in
the interview with him.

340
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,181
He was really, really kind
to everyone in the room.

341
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:00,920
And then we turned off the
cameras and I promise you,

342
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,050
he became even nicer.

343
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,660
We just had a conversation,
I thought he was gonna leave.

344
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,010
I mean, he's President
of the United States.

345
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,450
You've gotta go do something.

346
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,750
And he just chilled for a bit, you know?

347
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,550
And we spoke as human beings
and it went really well

348
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:13,957
until he turned to me and he said,

349
00:13:13,957 --> 00:13:16,433
"Trevor, you know, I
actually, I got a show

350
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:19,310
that I'm doing in a few
weeks, got a little thing,

351
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,950
that I thought maybe you
want to pop by and perform,

352
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,783
if you don't mind."

353
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,450
I said, "Mr. President,
I would be honored,

354
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,630
you just let me know when and where,

355
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,580
what's the show gonna be for, sir?"

356
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,710
He said, "Well, Trevor I'm doing
a little thing for my aides

357
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,800
and I thought, maybe
you'd want to be there."

358
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,500
I said, "I would love to, thank you...

359
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,599
Um, I'm sorry, a show for what?"

360
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,199
He said, "For my aides, Trevor."

361
00:13:38,672 --> 00:13:41,851
I said, "You have AIDS?"

362
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:44,684
(audience laughs)

363
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:54,988
And then he explained what he meant

364
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,980
and I wanted the earth to swallow me whole

365
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,420
because I had just looked at the President

366
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:12,420
of the United States and
asked him if he had AIDS.

367
00:14:17,602 --> 00:14:18,435
And you know what the worst thing is,

368
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:20,203
is that he was nice to me as well.

369
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,510
'Cause I said that and then he explained

370
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,640
and I was like, "Oh, I'm
so sorry Mr. President,

371
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,523
I didn't mean that.

372
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:26,356
I don't even know why I thought,

373
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:28,080
it's just like, you said
aides and like the AIDS."

374
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,840
You know, because here's the
thing in my defense, right.

375
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,550
I get it now, he means aides,

376
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:33,920
as in, the White House aides,

377
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,590
the people who help the
president, I get it now.

378
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,070
But in my defense where I'm
from, AIDS is some other shit

379
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,370
that doesn't help anybody.

380
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,637
No one in Africa is walking around like,

381
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:44,337
"Let me introduce you to my AIDS."
