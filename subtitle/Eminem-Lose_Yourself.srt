1
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,200
Look

2
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,640
If you had

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,880
One shot

4
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,560
One opportunity

5
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,000
To seize everything you ever wanted

6
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,760
One moment

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,120
Would you capture it

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,720
Or just let it slip?

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,880
Yo

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,720
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,580
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti

12
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,300
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,180
To drop bombs but he keeps on forgettin'

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,980
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud

15
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,620
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,460
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,320
The clock's run out, times up, over, blaow!

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,480
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,120
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,440
He's so mad, but he won't give up that Easy?

21
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,940
No

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,760
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes

23
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,140
It don't matter, he's dope

24
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,720
He knows that but he's broke

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,940
He's so stacked that he knows

26
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,580
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's

27
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,220
Back to the lab again yo

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,320
This whole rhapsody

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,180
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,580
Lose yourself in the music, the moment

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,860
You own it, you better never let it go

32
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,160
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

33
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,800
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,760
Lose yourself in the music, the moment

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,140
You own it, you better never let it go

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,280
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,120
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,420
The souls escaping, through this hole that it's gaping

39
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,460
This world is mine for the taking

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,940
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,000
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post-mortar

42
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,760
It only grows harder, only grows hotter

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,580
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him

44
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,440
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter

45
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,080
Lonely roads, God only knows

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,560
He's grown farther from home, he's no father

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,440
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,180
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water

49
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,080
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,460
They moved on to the next schmo who flows

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,280
He nose dove and sold nada

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,940
So the soap opera is told and unfolds

53
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,520
I suppose it's old partna', but the beat goes on

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,280
Da da dum da dum da da

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,800
Lose yourself in the music, the moment

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,160
You own it, you better never let it go

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,320
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

58
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,040
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

59
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,960
Lose yourself in the music, the moment

60
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,300
You own it, you better never let it go

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,460
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

62
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,340
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
