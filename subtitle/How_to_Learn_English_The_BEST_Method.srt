1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,760
I’m learning Spanish again and it’s so hard 
for me to understand native speakers. And if  

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,400
you’re studying English, I know I, and my fellow, 
native speakers can be difficult to understand.  

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,680
I struggled with this myself in college when 
I studied in the Dominican Republic, and then  

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,520
after college when I studied German in Germany 
for six months. I get it. So when I started  

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,840
teaching English, it was so important to me to 
develop a technique to help students hear English  

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,876
differently, to be able to join conversation and 
not just be stuck in written communication.  

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,320
The technique involves learning a specific aspect 
of spoken English with your mind, we do that through a video,  

8
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:48,560
then training that into your body with audio 
exercises, and then getting feedback from teachers  

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,531
along the way. And I’ve been helping students with 
this technique for five years now, and it works.

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,480
And to the rest of you guys like myself, keep  

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,601
working hard because it’s 
working, and I'm so happy.

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,058
You’ll hear more from him soon.

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,760
Wouldn’t you love right now to practice, say, a 
tricky sound in American English or a reduction  

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,040
and then have a teacher say, 
“Yes, that sounds perfect!”,  

15
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,629
or “Wait, that reduction still 
needs to be shorter, try this?”  

16
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,760
The best way to feel confident speaking English 
is to get help and guidance from trained teachers.  

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,800
And can you believe you get that as a part of 
my online school, Rachel’s English Academy?

18
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,720
I’m going to introduce you to these six 
fantastic teachers today and show you  

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,160
how they can guide you to the materials in 
my Academy for transformation and success  

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,682
in your spoken English, confidence 
that you can almost not imagine.

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,520
On November 5, I turn 43. And to celebrate 
my birthday, I’m offering a huge sale,  

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,720
the last one of the year, 81% off your intro 
month in the Academy with the code Rachel43.  

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,440
The sale is for 5 days only, it ends Sunday, 
and you can end your subscription at any time  

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,440
if you don’t feel like this method 
and these teachers work for you.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,760
What’s my academy? Well, this is the 30-second 
elevator pitch. It’s an online training ground for  

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,760
spoken English. We teach the concept, we give you 
the audio to train that concept into your habits,  

27
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,320
and then we give you the teacher resources to 
check in to make sure you’re on the right track  

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:32,080
with your training. Hundreds of exclusive videos 
and audio lessons, a method for self-training and  

29
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,240
self-improvement, a re-shaping of your habits and 
ideas about speaking English, teacher feedback  

30
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:44,418
and support. All online, all available 24-7 
for you to work on as it fits your schedule.

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,800
One of the most important things we can do 
for you in the Academy is change how you hear  

32
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,080
English. This is Tom, one of our teachers 
that you may work with in the Academy.

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,480
The idea of learning how to listen. Because I 
think, if you kind of train your ear to begin  

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,680
hearing the musical quality of American 
English it makes it a lot easier to imitate.

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,160
Do you recognize Tom? He’s been teaching with me  

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,960
for over 10 years and he’s been in my 
YouTube and Facebook videos before.

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,280
If you’re in my Academy, you can work 
with Katie. She talks about how, with the  

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,615
method and materials in the Academy, students 
start to hear things they didn’t hear before.

39
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,520
One thing that’s happened to me as I’ve been 
working with the students from Rachel’s English  

40
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:37,200
Academy is after a couple of weeks or so with the 
daily practice, they come back and say “Wow! I  

41
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,160
can understand things in conversation 
that I had no idea were happening before,  

42
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,080
just even little things 
like reductions and flap Ts,  

43
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,347
some of the other things that are so 
characteristic of American English.”

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,440
Isn’t that fantastic? It’s what makes us 
unique. These are your teachers. Most of  

45
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,400
the work is done on your own with the best 
method and materials available, but then,  

46
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,560
how do you know you’re doing it right? 
You’re not doing this alone. Through our  

47
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
private groups you’re with a team 
of teachers but all the other students too.

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,735
This is one of our students, Al.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,676
I’ve imitated so many Hollywood scenes as many as 
possible and of course, imitating so many scenes  

50
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,840
on movies or TV shows without 
knowing the technique was hard.  

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,680
Like I constantly make mistakes and nobody 
even corrected me until I found this academy,  

52
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,760
Rachel’s English Academy. And I can say 
that this academy has been my lifesaver.

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,640
Al had the right idea, but since she wasn’t 
learning the language with the supercharged  

54
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,920
brain of a young child, she needed a little 
bit more concrete information and guidance  

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,840
which is what she got in the academy. 
And with that information and guidance,  

56
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,640
the change in students can be truly 
amazing. This is our teacher Laura,  

57
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,760
talking about singing and noticing the 
changes through student’s hard work.

58
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,480
Sometimes I’ll be working with somebody and while 
we’re working on something and we’ll put it aside  

59
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,080
for now, they’ll keep visiting it in their 
practice time and then when I see them again  

60
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,480
maybe some times gone by, and they’re 
using it as if it’s just another natural  

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,360
part of their speech now. And I love 
hearing that, I love noticing that.

62
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,360
That’s the best part. Hearing a student 
speak naturally and comfortably. Now,  

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,640
because we’re talking about changing a habit here, 
that doesn’t happen overnight. It doesn’t happen  

64
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:42,880
with watching a video and learning something. You 
have to add training. I wish I could do that part  

65
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,400
for you but I can’t. It’s best to sign up 
for the Academy only if you have a minimum  

66
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,440
of 15 minutes a day to learn the tips and 
tricks about what makes American English  

67
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,560
sound American, and the training to bring 
those qualities into your own voice and body.

68
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,200
I asked Josh, another one of our 
fantastic teachers, to talk about  

69
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,440
what he notices in successful students, and 
guess what, it goes back to listening.

70
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,640
My favorite success story is 
that with students in the academy  

71
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,760
and those for the students who really get 
their ears tuned into the sound of English.  

72
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:22,720
And it really opens up the way they listen and 
what they say and how they use the language.  

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,320
Sometimes students spend a lot of 
time working on an individual sound.  

74
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,120
But once you can actually train them and get them 
to actually notice that difference, it changes  

75
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,240
everything about the way they approach it and they 
really get really, really motivated from that.

76
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,600
In the Academy we cover every topic 
in spoken English: placement & pitch,  

77
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,880
melody & intonation, rhythm, all 
the sounds, reductions and more.

78
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,480
I asked our teachers what their favorite 
course is and why. This is Ms Stokes’ answer.

79
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,720
Without question, the Stress 3 course 
is my favorite. It’s the place where  

80
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,680
you get the most bang for your buck. Your 
time investment pays off so much in that  

81
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,360
course. I don’t know a better place to 
improve rhythm and just to immediately  

82
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,840
sound so different in terms of the prose and 
thought groups, just the style of your speech.

83
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,480
Stress three is my personal favorite too.  

84
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,790
It focuses on reductions. You put in 
time training, you get a huge reward.

85
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,400
Now let’s meet Alicia, another one of 
the students in my Academy. She’s going  

86
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,280
to talk about what she thinks 
transforms students the most.

87
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,320
The other thing that I think help students really
transform in the academy is getting  

88
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,760
specific direct feedback from teachers. 
In the Facebook and community groups,  in

89
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,160
one to one lessons and in Whatsapp classes. 
So this combination of practicing with the  

90
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,568
sound boards, and then getting really 
specific personal feedback from teachers  

91
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,802
is the winning combination to help improve 
your English and help achieve your goals.

92
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,320
I just love the investment that 
our teachers make in our students,  

93
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,464
and the investment that our students make 
in themselves. Katie said it really well.

94
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,360
The Facebook and community group 
students are “total badasses”.  

95
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,560
They post videos of themselves practicing 
with the content in Rachel’s Academy and  

96
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,400
we as teachers get a glimpse into what they are 
working on, we get to help them make adjustments,  

97
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,240
give them feedback on how they’re doing, 
it’s so beneficial for them. Also they are just so

98
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,039
encouraging and supportive of each other. 
Everybody is working on the same journey,  

99
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,919
they maybe working on specifically different 
things in the Academy but they learn from  

100
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,040
each other, and they get to support each other 
throughout this process and it’s so fun to see.

101
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
Our students uplift each other. 
You sign up for the Academy,  

102
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,760
you get access to all the materials. The videos, 
with the tips and tricks, and the audios to  

103
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,000
train with. Every day you can log on and step 
through the method. And in the community groups,  

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,280
the students and the teachers motivate and 
support each other. So now is the time,  

105
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,360
now is your chance to get started in the Academy 
and save some money with this discount code,  

106

code is Rachel43 for 81% off your first month.

110
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,480
What do our students think about our teachers?  

111
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,670
This is Kostas, he’s a long-time 
student, active in the community.

112
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,587
I haven't stopped since then and I’m not 
going to stop. I’m not going to stop because

113
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:02,184
Rachel and her team, they gave me 
hope. They gave me hope, and you know,  

114
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:09,840
you see back then, I would never dare to try to 
do an American accent. It was, I would never dare.  

115
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,800
I would, I would, even if I was in a private 
room, and I would try to do an American accent,  

116
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,960
I would just, sometimes I would cry. I would 
just, you know, turn into a red  

117
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,600
apple. And I would just shut down. I would 
hear my voice trying to do an American accent,  

118
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,240
and I would just start crying immediately because 
it would trigger me that I will never become what  

119
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,120
I want to become. I will never be able to compete 
with all these Australian actors that so easily  

120
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,240
can do American accent. And I would never be equal 
and it really, it really hurts, it really hurts,  

121
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,400
and you know, when you try so hard, and you 
just, you don't have someone to back you up.  

122
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,880
But when I met Rachel, through Rachel's English 
Academy, I got her and her team to back me up.

123
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,840
Kostas, we do have your back and I am so glad 
for your successes. Since posting that video,  

124
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,147
he’s been cast in a play where he 
has to have an American accent.

125
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:18,640
Now I'm practicing this. This is a script. It's 
a, it's a script for a play here in Melbourne.

126
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:26,159
I wouldn’t be able to do this play 
if it wasn’t for Rachel and her team.

127
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:34,762
If I didn't have Rachel and her team, this 
simply wouldn't be possible right now. So.  

128
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:45,808
Thank you Rachel and your team. And to the rest 
of you guys like myself, whatever level you are  

129
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:55,162
at, keep working hard because it's working. I'm 
so happy, that I, you know, that it's working

130
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,392
because now I can do this and I'm following 
my dream and who knows where I'm going to be  

131
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,920
in a year from now. Because now I can pick up the 
script and I apply everything I'm learning, I've  

132
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,480
learned and I keep learning. And polish my accent, 
you my pronoun-, you know my punctuation, and,  

133
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,928
you know, I, I just know. I read and 
I know how to say the word. It's,  

134
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,593
it's just perfect. It's wonderful. And I owe 
everything to Rachel and her team. So, thank you.

135
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:36,560
Kostas, we are so proud of you. You have put 
in the time, you continue to put in the time,  

136
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,000
you’re an inspiration. A lot of my students 
don’t need to sound American, after all,  

137
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,920
accents are beautiful. They just want to be more 
confident and fluent in speaking English. And  

138
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,760
our teachers, through our private communities, 
help them. This is Ella, a student from China.

139
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,760
I also like the big support team from the Academy. 
Like all the teachers in this team are awesome.  

140
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:12,480
Every time when I submit my own recording to the 
Facebook group, the teacher can always identify my  

141
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,000
mistakes, small mistakes that 
I could have never realized  

142
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,960
myself. And they always give me very clear 
and easy to follow instructions to improve.

143
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,960
The teachers can be so precise in 
their feedback because we’re using  

144
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,680
video. I really find that 
so effective. This is Dave.

145
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:44,400
And then the second part about this Academy, which 
is I like about, is that they have beautiful and  

146
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:53,851
caring staff. So each time I upload uh, 
my video challenge on the community group,  

147
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,600
I usually get like a feedback within one or 
two days or so, which is very efficient in my  

148
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:13,519
personal experience, in my personal opinion. Even 
though this mistake are tiny or small, I think  

149
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,520
this is very important to me because I was able 
to incorporate this moment mistakes into my daily  

150
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:33,273
speaking habits, and I think in long-term runs 
has a prolonged effect in my pronunciation skills.  

151
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:44,320
So these feedbacks are very valuable and no 
other classes would able to do that I say.

152
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,760
And you already know Al.

153
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,560
The teachers are so encouraging 
and very expert. Um,  

154
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,320
they can correct my mistakes in the most specific 
way, so I could, I can just change my habit,  

155
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,000
I can see my improvements and now I 
can feel so confident in my English,  

156
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,240
and I really, really want you to also feel 
what I feel when you speak in English.

157
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,320
This is Gabriella from Brazil.

158
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,138
Through the Facebook group, I met 
my colleagues and the teachers.  

159
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,784
So there I can post my videos and I have fast 
feedback from my colleagues and teachers.  

160
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,720
And actually, in my first posted video, I got 
surprised when I saw a comment with a video  

161
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:51,015
from a teacher. So it was amazing because it 
was a video about my improvements, about what,  

162
00:15:51,360 --> 00:16:01,760
about what I was doing about that post that I 
did. So it was specific for me, it was specific  

163
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:11,840
for that assignment, it was specific for that 
post. So yeah, it was amazing feedback for me.

164
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:18,080
All of you students inspire us teachers to hone 
our craft and keep working hard to become better  

165
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:25,280
teachers. I can’t tell you how lucky I feel to be 
a part of this community of teachers and students,  

166
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,800
all supporting one another, knowing one another, 
caring about one another. It’s such an uplifting  

167
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,760
and motivating group of people. So come 
join our Academy. I want to see you there.

168
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,630
Tom wants to see you there.

169
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,600
I love the Facebook group, I love the community 
group in the Academy because I think that the  

170
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:52,640
students are unbelievably brave to share their 
practice with the community. And what is great,  

171
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:59,600
and the reason that I love that community so much 
is that it is a safe place to share your practice. People are  

172
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,079
unbelievably supportive. There are so many 
moments where someone will share a video  

173
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,359
and they’ll get lots of comments saying, 
“Wow! Way to go, you sound awesome! I’m so  

174
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:15,795
inspired to go work on that material now.” And 
that kind of connection, student to student,  

175
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,800
that wouldn’t happen without those faces, 
that Facebook group and the community group.  

176
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:27,760
And so to me, being able to be there as a teacher, 
to provide you know really positive, constructive  

177
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,560
feedback to kind of help a student understand 
where they may still have challenges but also to  

178
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:38,400
highlight for them where they having successes and 
to create a space where you can kind of feel that  

179
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,640
forward moving energy of progress of getting 
better. That to me is what that Facebook group is,  

180
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,960
that community group and it’s an awesome thing 
to be a part of so you know as a teacher,  

181
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,520
I get to be a part of it because I’m offering 
concrete feedback for what you can do to improve,  

182
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,680
what you can do to kind of continue on your 
path, but other students are also kind of  

183
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,080
chiming in with their thoughts and most of 
the time just lots of motivation and it is,  

184
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,000
it’s really inspirational to be in there and see 
all of that activity. It’s a lot of great energy.

185
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Laura wants to see you there.

186
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,440
For me as a teacher, I get to check in 
on people’s progress as they work through  

187
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:29,200
the daily plan. And it’s great to see people who 
stick with it for a long time and you can hear  

188
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
them work through each module 
and improve and keep getting  

189
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,640
smoother and smoother and clearer 
and clearer in their language.

190
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,720
Josh wants to see you there.

191
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,840
I love the attitude that the students bring 
to the academy. They’re all so motivated to  

192
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,920
learn they’re all so grateful for all 
the help they get through the academy.

193
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Alicia wants to see you there.

194
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,520
I love that I’m meeting students from 
around the world and then I’m helping  

195
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,600
them improve their English and reach their 
goals. I love students encourage each other,  

196
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,960
support each other and cheer 
each other on these groups  

197
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,240
and I also love seeing their progress over time. 
I love seeing the students come in in module 1  

198
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,104
and then work through one challenge at a time 
and just get better and better and better.

199
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,720
Katie wants to see you there.

200
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:26,320
It’s been so great just to know all of them, uhm, 
they also have a strong desire and motivation  

201
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,600
to speak English and to better 
themselves, I’m so impressed by them,  

202
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:39,408
they are willing to put in the hard work and just 
super dedicate it so I love getting to know them.

203
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,734
Ms.Stokes wants to see you there.

204
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:47,680
These are people who are highly motivated, 
self-driven, goal-driven and I’m continually  

205
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,568
inspired of how much progress they’re 
able to make at their own pace.

206
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,120
