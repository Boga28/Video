1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:09,640
I'm Gill at www.engvid.com and today's lesson
is on seven time expressions, okay?

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:16,640
Seven different ways of using the word "time"
with slightly different meanings, okay?

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,060
So, let's have a look.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:23,830
So, the first one is "on time".

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:33,070
If you're on time, that means you're exactly
on - arriving at the time agreed.

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:40,080
If you're coming for an 11:00 meeting, you
arrive at 11:00.

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,850
It's what we call "on the dot".

8
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,870
On the dot, meaning the dot on the clock.

9
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:57,660
So, you can say, "The train left on time",
on the timetable for the train, the train

10
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:06,010
is supposed to leave at 12:00 and it does
leave exactly at 12:00.

11
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:12,900
So, on time is exactly on the dot, okay?

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,100
Not before, not after, but exactly on time.

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,260
Okay.

14
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,440
Right.

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,740
Next one, "in time".

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:28,260
So, just by changing the preposition from
"on" to "in", "in time".

17
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:36,770
So, here's an example sentence: Don't worry,
we'll be in time to catch the train.

18
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,390
So, you're going to catch a train.

19
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,549
Somebody is worried you're going to be late,
you will miss the train.

20
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:48,030
But someone else says, "No, it's okay.

21
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,280
I know how long it takes to get to the station.

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,510
We will be in time to catch the train."

23
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:04,700
So, that means you will arrive at the station
a number of minutes before the train is due

24
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
to leave.

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,530
So, comfortably, a number of minutes where
you're not having to run because you think

26
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,660
you're going to miss it.

27
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,569
So, we'll be in time, don't worry.

28
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:18,860
Okay.

29
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:26,300
And then, moving on from that one, "in good
time" means you have even more time, lots

30
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
of time.

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,470
So, we arrived in good time for the coach
trip.

32
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,390
If you're going on coach trip for the day,
a day trip into the countryside or something,

33
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:49,140
you have to arrive at the departure place
by, say, 12:00.

34
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,670
If you arrive at 11:30, that's a whole half
hour before the coach leaves.

35
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,020
So, you could say that's in good time.

36
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:06,300
It means "plenty of time".

37
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,010
Plenty of time.

38
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,060
You can arrive, you have half an hour, you
can relax, okay?

39
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,890
So, that's in good time.

40
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,349
And then the other - going back the other
way again.

41
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:22,740
"Just in time".

42
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:27,739
We caught the train just in time before it
left.

43
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:32,209
So, that's very close to the departure time.

44
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:39,099
So, the departure time.

45
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:42,519
The time that it's scheduled to leave.

46
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:43,710
Just in time.

47
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:52,800
So maybe the train is due to leave at 12:00
and you got in at one minute to 12:00, so

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,080
it's that close.

49
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,140
Just in time.

50
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,140
Okay.

51
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,790
So, that's like about a minute before.

52
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,430
This one, "only just in time", is even less
than that.

53
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,849
So, "We were only just in time to catch the
train."

54
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:21,350
If you're only just in time, maybe it was
ten seconds before the train left, or five

55
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,450
seconds, very, very close to leaving.

56
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,780
You know, the guy was blowing the whistle
and the doors were slamming or the doors were

57
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,720
closing.

58
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,630
Only just in time, it means you nearly missed
it, okay?

59
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:47,250
So, you're probably out of breath and you
sit down and you think, "Oh, oh, we made it

60
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,100
only just in time."

61
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,100
Okay.

62
00:04:50,100 --> 00:05:01,130
And then this one, "in the meantime" is when
you have some time to fill in before something

63
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,810
else happens.

64
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,890
So, you've gone to see a film for example,
and you're at the cinema.

65
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,290
But the film doesn't start for another hour.

66
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:20,199
So, "We have an hour before the film starts",
so what do you do for an hour?

67
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:31,300
"So, in the meantime", while we're waiting,
in that hour that we have to spare, what shall

68
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
we do?

69
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,900
"Shall we go for coffee?"

70
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:43,050
So, in the meantime is something you do to
fill in the time while you're waiting for

71
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,890
something else, okay?

72
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:54,220
And then finally in this first half of the
lesson, "it's about time", or you can make

73
00:05:54,220 --> 00:06:06,889
it a question, "isn't it about time?" is when
you think something is overdue.

74
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:17,080
So, if something is overdue, you've been waiting
for something and it hasn't happened and you

75
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,300
think, "Oh, it's about time that happened."

76
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,669
Or, "Isn't it about time that happened?

77
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:27,639
We've been waiting now, a long time."

78
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:34,660
So, the sort of thing you might say at work,
for example, if you've worked for a company

79
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,080
for ten years and maybe you've never had a
pay raise.

80
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,509
That's a bit extreme, ten years without a
pay raise, but anyway, this is just an example.

81
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:54,860
So, you could say, "I think it's about time
I got a pay raise."

82
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,639
This is in the past tense.

83
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,930
You wouldn't say, "It's about time I get a
pay raise."

84
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:09,430
It's about time I got a pay rise, because
it's a kind of conditional thing.

85
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,520
You haven't got a pay rise, so it's about
time I got a pay rise.

86
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:20,490
It's almost a kind of subjunctive form, okay.

87
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:26,210
And then you can turn that into - you can
add a question about the pay rise and you

88
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,289
think, "Isn't it about time I got a promotion,
too?

89
00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:34,740
After ten years?"

90
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:42,210
So, that's using it as a statement, "I think
it's about time I got a pay rise."

91
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:52,270
And then you can use the question form, "And
isn't it about time I got a promotion, too?"

92
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,300
Okay.

93
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,020
So, that's seven different time expressions.

94
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:05,669
And in the second half of the lesson, we have
a little test where you can fill in the gaps

95
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:07,319
in some sentences.

96
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:15,770
Okay, so let's have a look at these sentences,
which have gaps for all the time expressions,

97
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,099
okay.

98
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:28,490
So, the first one: To avoid stress, I made
sure that I arrived ____ ____ _____ for the

99
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,169
interview.

100
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,260
I'll go through them first, then we'll go
back over it.

101
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:39,851
We were ___ ____ ____ ____ for the coach.

102
00:08:39,851 --> 00:08:47,649
The project was completed ___ _______, right
on schedule.

103
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:57,629
Isn't it __ __ something was done about that
empty building?

104
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:09,329
If we don't arrive at the theatre __ ___ for
the start, they won't let us in.

105
00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:19,309
My friend will be in two hours, so ___ ___
_____ I'll do some homework - sorry, housework,

106
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,190
not homework.

107
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,759
Do some cleaning around the house, okay?

108
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:36,639
And finally: We thought we'd be late, but
we arrived __ ___ ____ to see the start of

109
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,790
the film.

110
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:46,449
Okay, so there are seven sentences there and
we have seven time expressions to fit in,

111
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:47,540
one of each.

112
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,519
So, let's have a look.

113
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,279
So, you're going for an interview, which is
stressful anyway.

114
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:06,610
So, to avoid stress, I made sure that I arrived
__ ___ _____ for the interview.

115
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,959
So, the idea here is that you have plenty
of time, okay?

116
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:20,490
Not just a minute before the interview begins,
but lots, lots of time so that you can relax

117
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,069
a little bit.

118
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:24,449
So, which one is that?

119
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:29,199
I made sure that I arrived __ ___ ____.

120
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:33,299
The number of words, of course, gives you
a clue.

121
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:39,129
So, in - something - time.

122
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,050
So, not just "in time".

123
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,529
You could say that.

124
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:49,499
I made sure that I arrived in time for the
interview, but everybody tries to do that.

125
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:55,649
If you want a little bit of extra time to
be able to sit down and relax, what's the

126
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:57,269
other word?

127
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:01,730
In good time.

128
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,980
Okay.

129
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,939
In good time for the interview.

130
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:10,199
Plenty of time to spare, okay.

131
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:16,869
Right, next one: We were - now, we have four
words here - for the coach.

132
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:26,069
So, a coach is setting off on a day trip or
something, and this situation, you nearly

133
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:27,269
missed it.

134
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,899
You nearly missed the coach.

135
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:39,980
So, another two seconds and the driver would
not have seen you and let you onto the coach.

136
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:47,660
He probably had already closed the doors and
then, at the last moment, he saw you and opened

137
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,339
the doors and let you onto the coach.

138
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,299
So, it was very, very close to missing the
coach.

139
00:11:55,299 --> 00:12:02,929
So, we were - so, "time" comes here.

140
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:14,240
Can you remember the other words? "in time",
you were in time, we were ___ ___ in time.

141
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:24,040
So, "only", only just in time.

142
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,230
We were only just in time for the coach.

143
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,699
Okay.

144
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:31,170
Right.

145
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:37,720
Next one: The project was completed __ _____,
right on schedule.

146
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:44,799
So, this means the same as "right on schedule",
on the dot.

147
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,929
The date it was meant to be completed, that
was the date it was completed.

148
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:58,239
So, it was completed - so, we have "time"
here, which is the preposition that you put

149
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,519
with it when it's on the dot?

150
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,570
Well, this gives you a clue.

151
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:08,859
"On schedule", "on the dot", on time.

152
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:14,109
Okay, exactly, precisely, Okay, good.

153
00:13:14,109 --> 00:13:18,490
So, then we have a question.

154
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:25,379
Isn't it __ ___ something was done about that
empty building?

155
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:28,379
There's an empty building.

156
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:34,699
Maybe it's been empty for ten years or more
and it's in bad condition, probably.

157
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:37,529
It's boarded up, it looks terrible.

158
00:13:37,529 --> 00:13:42,910
You wish somebody would do something about
it.

159
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,899
Open it up and use it, renovate it, do something
nice with it.

160
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,029
So, you're asking, isn't it __ ___.

161
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:59,989
So, "time" goes there, and what's the other
word that goes with it when you're asking

162
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:02,149
this question?

163
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:10,079
Isn't it about time?

164
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:17,069
Isn't it about time something was - subjunctive
- done about that empty building?

165
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:21,239
It's terrible, the way it's just been left.

166
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:23,470
Okay, good.

167
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:32,689
Next one, "If we don't arrive at the theatre
__ ____ for the start," the start of the play,

168
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:35,019
"they won't let us in."

169
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:44,019
In some theatres, if you're not there, they
close the doors.

170
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:55,519
They don't let you into the performance space,
the auditorium, because you will disturb other

171
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,519
people and disturb the performers as well.

172
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,160
So, sometimes they won't let people in if
they're late.

173
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,449
So, if we don't arrive at the theatre __ ____,
so this would be "time".

174
00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:19,399
So, you have to be there before the start
time.

175
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,959
So, what preposition goes here?

176
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:34,279
If we don't arrive at the theatre in time,
in time for the start, they won't let us in.

177
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,279
Okay.

178
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:42,419
Right, next one: My friend will be here - you're
at home, expecting your friend - my friend

179
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:44,389
will be here in two hours.

180
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:46,809
You have two whole hours.

181
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:51,680
Are you going to just sit there and wait for
two hours?

182
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:59,439
No, so hopefully not, unless you want to meditate.

183
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:05,299
That's useful, it's always good to use the
time somehow in a constructive way, even if

184
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,559
it's meditating.

185
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:08,569
That's good.

186
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:10,970
Or sleeping, maybe?

187
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:18,579
As long as you're using it for something and
not just wasting time, okay?

188
00:16:18,579 --> 00:16:25,209
My friend will be here in two hours, so __
__ _____, I'll do some housework.

189
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:29,559
So, that's a very useful thing to do while
you're waiting.

190
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,619
So, what do we put in here?

191
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:42,519
When you're filling in some time by doing
something else while you're waiting, so we

192
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,970
have a word here that ends with "time", but
it's a longer word.

193
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,879
Do you remember that one, beginning with "m"?

194
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,779
Meantime, okay.

195
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:01,129
So, that's "meantime".

196
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:10,609
So, in the meantime, I'll do some housework.

197
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,259
Okay.

198
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:21,579
And then finally, "We thought we'd be late,
but we arrived __ __ _____ to see the start

199
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,740
of the film".

200
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:28,970
So, you thought you were going to be late,
but you weren't.

201
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,669
You were very close to being late, though.

202
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:38,800
So, this is that one where you're very close
to being late, but maybe with one minute to

203
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:44,700
spare, you get into your seats and then the
film starts.

204
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:53,559
So, we arrived ___ ____ time.

205
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:57,669
That's "in time", what's the word here?

206
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:02,649
We arrived just in time.

207
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,740
Okay?

208
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,120
We had "only just in time" there, which is
even closer to being late.

209
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,290
This wasn't quite as close to being late.

210
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,039
Just in time to see the start of the film.

211
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,340
Okay, so I hope that was helpful.

212
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:28,350
So, also, if you would like to go the website
www.engvid.com , there is a quiz to test you

213
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,500
a little bit further on this subject.

214
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,370
So, thank you very much for watching and see
you again soon.

215
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,460
Bye for now!
