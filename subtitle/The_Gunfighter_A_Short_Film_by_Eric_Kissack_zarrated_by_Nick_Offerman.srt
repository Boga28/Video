1
00:00:00,739 --> 00:00:04,406
(dramatic orchestral music)

2
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,973
(people chattering)

3
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:36,628
- [Narrator] The weary gunfighter

4
00:00:36,628 --> 00:00:39,108
walked slowly through the saloon.

5
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:42,916
The long miles from Cheyenne
had taken their toll.

6
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,469
- Who's saying that stuff?

7
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:47,445
- [Narrator] He scanned the
room with a suspicious eye.

8
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:49,983
Years of being on the
wrong side of the law

9
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,629
had taught him that a tough
man can get out of a situation,

10
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,108
but a smart man never
gets himself into one.

11
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:57,708
- Please quit doing that, I just want to

12
00:00:57,708 --> 00:00:59,892
have a shot of whiskey in peace.

13
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:02,326
- [Narrator] But the
gunfighter would find no peace.

14
00:01:02,326 --> 00:01:04,516
For the Henderson boys
were waiting in the corner

15
00:01:04,516 --> 00:01:08,860
to kill him for the
$200 bounty on his head.

16
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,110
- Is that true?

17
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:14,253
You boys trying to kill me
like this voice is saying?

18
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:15,086
- Uhh...

19
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,676
No.

20
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:19,504
- [Narrator] Lied the
oldest Henderson boy.

21
00:01:19,504 --> 00:01:20,476
- How do you know I'm lying?

22
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:22,684
- [Narrator] The oldest
Henderson boy asked of the air.

23
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:24,193
- No, I didn't ask the air.

24
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:27,026
I'm asking you, you fuckin' voice.

25
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:29,839
- [Narrator] Said the
oldest Henderson boy.

26
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,672
- Would you please stop saying

27
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:32,473
"Said the oldest Henderson boy"?

28
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:36,209
- [Narrator] Implored Tommy,
the oldest Henderson boy.

29
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:38,662
Meanwhile, the younger
Henderson's hand twitched

30
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:41,123
by the Colt Peacemaker on his right hip.

31
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:43,090
He was thinking of shouting
"Look out behind you"

32
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,401
to trick the gunfighter
into turning around

33
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:47,001
so he could shoot him in the back.

34
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,233
- No, I was not!

35
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,260
- Come on, Johnny, again
with the "Look behind you"?

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,409
What were you gonna say
was behind him this time?

37
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:53,652
- Uhh, nothing.

38
00:01:53,652 --> 00:01:54,810
- [Narrator] Johnny lied.

39
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,802
He was going to say a bear.

40
00:01:56,802 --> 00:01:57,635
- Oh, come on.

41
00:01:57,635 --> 00:01:58,468
(people laughing)

42
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:00,336
- A bear, Johnny? In a saloon?

43
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:02,104
- [Narrator] Johnny's face turned red.

44
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:04,576
He began wishing he was in a safe place

45
00:02:04,576 --> 00:02:07,680
at home, in bed, with his dolls.

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,502
(Johnny scoffs)

47
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:11,590
Hey, hey, I ain't got no dolls!

48
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,553
- [Narrator] To calm his
nerves, he pictured himself

49
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:17,725
combing his dolls' hair and
pouring them each a cup of tea.

50
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:19,122
- No!

51
00:02:19,122 --> 00:02:20,662
- Wait, wait, wait.

52
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:23,745
You have tea parties with your dolls?

53
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:25,681
- [Narrator] But something about

54
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:27,520
the younger Henderson's vulnerability

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,840
opened a door in the gunfighter's heart.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,808
- Nope, no it didn't!

57
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,160
- [Narrator] Inside, a
sea of confusing emotions

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,476
bubbled to the surface.

59
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:36,309
- No.

60
00:02:36,309 --> 00:02:37,809
- [Narrator] He started imagining himself

61
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,226
holding the younger Henderson

62
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,275
and stroking his greasy hair.

63
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:42,108
- No!

64
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,280
- [Narrator] He pictured his first kiss

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,464
with the younger Henderson.

66
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:45,297
- No, that--

67
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,744
- [Narrator] They both
giggle at how clumsy it was.

68
00:02:46,744 --> 00:02:47,577
- No.

69
00:02:47,577 --> 00:02:49,570
- [Narrator] They know the
next one will be even better.

70
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,459
- I'm seriously not picturing that!

71
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:52,715
- [Narrator] But inside he was.

72
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:53,810
- No, I'm not!

73
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,691
- [Narrator] But he was.

74
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:58,024
- No, I'm not and that's the final word.

75
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,743
- [Narrator] But he was.

76
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:08,743
- Goddamnit!

77
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:12,144
- Why don't you two go get a room?

78
00:03:12,144 --> 00:03:15,355
- Hey, why should we
trust this voice anyway?

79
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:17,520
- [Narrator] Just then,
the gunfighter had an idea.

80
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,411
- Hey, you.

81
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:19,244
- Me?

82
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:20,984
- Think of a number between one and 100

83
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:22,557
and then we'll see if this voice

84
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,131
really knows what we're thinkin'!

85
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:25,699
- Okay, got it.

86
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:27,548
- [Narrator] Sally the
whore began thinking

87
00:03:27,548 --> 00:03:31,140
of her favorite number, which was 32.

88
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,900
She then thought of her lady
parts and how itchy they were

89
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,307
before deciding to change
her mind and go with 76,

90
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:39,179
her second favorite number.

91
00:03:39,179 --> 00:03:41,024
- The voice is right!

92
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:43,335
32 is my favorite number,

93
00:03:43,335 --> 00:03:45,882
but then I changed my
mind and went with 76!

94
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,574
- And your cooch?

95
00:03:47,574 --> 00:03:50,126
- It's been itching something
horrible since Saturday, Bill.

96
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:51,695
You know anything about that?

97
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,094
- Uhh,

98
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:54,118
no.

99
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:57,510
- [Narrator] He did, but
we'll get to that in a minute.

100
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,858
- Looks like that voice
really does know everything.

101
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:01,850
- [Narrator] The gunfighter
noticed for the first time

102
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,050
that the bartender was black.

103
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,082
This was still unusual in the west,

104
00:04:06,082 --> 00:04:09,442
but the gunfighter decided
he was okay with it.

105
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:10,609
- Umm, thanks?

106
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:13,626
- [Narrator] The people in
the town prided themselves

107
00:04:13,626 --> 00:04:16,098
for their progressive
attitudes about race.

108
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:17,218
- That's right.

109
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:18,755
- [Narrator] But would
they still feel that way

110
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:20,618
if they knew that Sam had been sleeping

111
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:22,442
with Ned Schilling's wife?

112
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:23,442
- What!?

113
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:25,581
- Relax, Ned, alright?

114
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:28,817
I mean, everyone has been with her.

115
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:29,769
- Guilty.

116
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,556
- Yeah, you're right.

117
00:04:31,556 --> 00:04:33,860
- [Narrator] And Elijah Jessup's sister.

118
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,778
- Welp, it's time for him to die.

119
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:37,897
(cocking guns)

120
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:39,316
- Watch yourself, Jessup.

121
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:41,554
You best put that gun down
or I'll cut you in half.

122
00:04:41,554 --> 00:04:44,221
(ominous music)

123
00:04:46,739 --> 00:04:47,822
- That music,

124
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:50,826
it seems kind of ominous, don't it?

125
00:04:50,826 --> 00:04:51,659
- Ominous.

126
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:53,946
What's that mean?

127
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:56,246
- You know, like, something
bad's about to happen,

128
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:58,627
like a needless gunfight.

129
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:00,467
- [Narrator] The stage
was set for an awesome

130
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,475
ballet of death.

131
00:05:02,475 --> 00:05:04,907
Blood would be spilled,
but who would be the first?

132
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:05,923
- Wait a second.

133
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:07,275
Ballet of death?

134
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:08,491
What the hell?

135
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:11,218
I think this voice wants
us to kill each other.

136
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,321
- [Narrator] Meanwhile, the
gunfighter saw his opening

137
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:14,687
to shoot Tommy dead.

138
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:15,825
- No, no, no, wait!

139
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:17,513
That one really is a lie, see?

140
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:19,145
My hand's nowhere near my gun.

141
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:20,441
- [Narrator] Okay, you got me.

142
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:22,068
That one wasn't true.

143
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,164
But this one is.

144
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:25,305
Yesterday, Tommy Henderson made sweet love

145
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:26,712
to Bill Jessup's wife.

146
00:05:26,712 --> 00:05:27,545
- No!

147
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:30,279
You made sweet love to our mama?

148
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,991
- (laughs uncomfortably)
Here's the thing about that.

149
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:35,674
- Oh, you're dead, Henderson.

150
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,727
- [Narrator] Said Gabriel,
who had recently delivered

151
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:41,894
a load of cream to the back
porch of his brother's wife.

152
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,617
He did her in the butt.

153
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:45,665
- What!?

154
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,526
- How could you? Your own brother!

155
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:50,010
- [Narrator] Yet even as
Bill reacted with disgust,

156
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,863
the irony was not lost on him.

157
00:05:51,863 --> 00:05:54,877
- You know what, I see
where you're goin' with this

158
00:05:54,877 --> 00:05:57,732
and I'm just gonna retract
my disgust right now

159
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,788
if that's possible.

160
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:00,220
- [Narrator] For he had
been regularly sneaking

161
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,972
into Paul Valentine's barn.

162
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:04,780
- Okay, you know, we're
good, we're good here.

163
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,508
I think we should just move on.

164
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:08,724
- [Narrator] Where he had been having sex

165
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:11,347
with Paul's favorite sheep Martha.

166
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:12,180
- Oh boy.

167
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,697
- Marth, Bill!?

168
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:14,729
Martha!?

169
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,145
- That is why I've been
so itchy? (cocks gun)

170
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:18,105
- You know what?

171
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:21,105
We all just need to
take a deep breath here.

172
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:23,513
We're playin' right
into the voice's hands.

173
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:25,033
Sure, there's been a surprising amount

174
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,105
of infidelity in this town,

175
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,881
and the bestiality should probably stop,

176
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:31,633
and I might be gay.

177
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:34,713
But if we start shootin', the voice wins.

178
00:06:34,713 --> 00:06:36,986
I think the voice is
givin' us an opportunity.

179
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:39,425
In a world where our
deepest, darkest secrets

180
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:41,170
are unveiled one by one,

181
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,051
maybe we'll stop doing the
things we're ashamed of

182
00:06:44,051 --> 00:06:46,521
and start to embrace the
things about ourselves

183
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:48,146
we're afraid to accept.

184
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:50,804
Hell, this could be the
beginning of a new utopia,

185
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:54,121
a society based on fairness and tolerance

186
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:56,852
where it don't matter
if you're rich or poor--

187
00:06:56,852 --> 00:06:58,169
- Or a woman!

188
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:00,913
- Let's not get carried
away, but the point is,

189
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:04,209
is that the voice is showing
us the worst side of ourselves

190
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:06,905
and we need to show it our best.

191
00:07:06,905 --> 00:07:08,288
Now, who's with me?

192
00:07:08,288 --> 00:07:09,538
- [All] Yeehaw!

193
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:13,820
- [Narrator] It was a good speech

194
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,880
and things might have
turned out differently

195
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,577
if the crowd never found
out that the gunfighter

196
00:07:18,577 --> 00:07:21,024
had just last night shot and killed

197
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,552
the youngest son of John McCullers,

198
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:26,560
because he "had some
breath that smelled like

199
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,893
"the ass end of a Chinaman."

200
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,917
- Well, you must be Mr. McCullers.

201
00:07:34,917 --> 00:07:36,292
(fires gun)

202
00:07:36,292 --> 00:07:38,792
(guns firing)

203
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:54,379
- [Narrator] It was a
true ballet of death.

204
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,175
When the gruesome bloodbath was over,

205
00:07:57,175 --> 00:08:00,826
not a single person was left standing,

206
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:04,304
except for Sally, the itchy whore.

207
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:05,304
- Yoo!

208
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:08,992
- [Narrator] Who celebrated
by scratching her front porch.

209
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,433
- [Sally] Whoo!

210
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:11,448
- [Narrator] Little did she know,

211
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:14,200
she would be mauled to
death by a rabid wolf

212
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,692
the very next day.

213
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:16,775
- Well, fuck.

214
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:21,283
(dramatic orchestral music)
