Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel 
Sparkle English where I teach you how to  

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:14,720
improve your level of English. Today is going 
to be a very important beginner grammar lesson  

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:22,480
on the difference between A, AN, SOME, and ANY. 
These are very common words in English and it's  

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,480
important that you know how to use them. First, 
we need to learn the difference between countable  

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,240
nouns and uncountable nouns. Countable nouns have 
a singular and plural form. In plural, these nouns  

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,520
can be used with a number, which is why they are 
called countable nouns. For example, we could say  

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:52,000
I have one dog, or I have two dogs. Uncountable 
Nouns can only be used in the singular form. These  

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,640
nouns cannot be used with a number, which is why 
they are called uncountable nouns. For example,  

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,640
we can say I have money, but we can't say I have 
one money, or I have two money. So now let's learn  

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:15,920
when we use AP or n, we use the articles AP, 
or N in front of singular countable nouns,  

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,720
is used when the next word starts with 
a consonant sound. So for example,  

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:33,760
I have a cat, I need a laptop. Because cat and 
laptop both begin with a consonant sound, we use  

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:42,640
AP, and is used when the next word starts with 
a vowel sound. For example, I want an ice cream,  

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,240
he's eating an orange. Both ice cream 
and orange begin with a vowel sound.  

15
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:59,840
So we use and we use some and any with plural 
countable nouns and uncountable nouns. Some  

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,840
is generally used in positive or affirmative 
sentences. For example, I have some bad news.  

17
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:15,600
She invited some friends over for dinner. 
Any is generally used in negative sentences.  

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,560
For example, there isn't any milk 
left. She doesn't have any friends.  

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,160
We can use either any or some in questions. 
However, there is a small difference.  

20
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,720
We usually use any in requests for information. 
For example, do you have any wrapping paper?  

21
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,320
Does she play any sports? And we 
usually use some in offers and requests?  

22
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Can I please have some cake? 
Would you like some coffee?  

23
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,560
So now let's review ah, and some and any in a 
bit more detail and do some practice together.  

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay, so before our quiz, we're going to 
quickly go over these again. We use r and n  

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,680
in front of singular countable nouns, we use an 
in front of a singular countable noun that begins  

26
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:25,120
with a consonant sound. So for example, I have 
a banana. And we use an in front of a singular  

27
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:34,560
countable noun that begins with a vowel sound. For 
example, I want an orange. We use both some and  

28
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:43,360
any with plural countable and uncountable nouns. 
Some is mainly used in affirmative sentences.  

29
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:51,680
For example, I bought some balloons for the 
party. Natasha has some homework to do before bed.  

30
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,440
Both of these are affirmative sentences. 
So we use some in the question form, we can  

31
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:08,480
use some in offers and requests. For example, 
would you like some tea? Can I have some pie?  

32
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:18,560
Any is mainly used in negative sentences and 
questions, example, and doesn't have any dates  

33
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:27,600
this week. There isn't any coffee left. Both 
of these are negative sentences. So we use any  

34
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:36,240
and not some. We usually use any in questions 
with requests for information. For example,  

35
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:45,360
are there any cute guys at the party? Do we 
have any flour? So now we're going to do a quiz,  

36
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,040
you have to fill in the blanks with an n sum or 
any? There will be eight questions in this quiz.  

37
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:03,840
Question number one, Joe doesn't have ___ 
friends. Question two, I'd like ___ cake please.

38
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:14,640
Question three. Do you get ___ presents on your 
birthday? Question four, would you like ___ water?  

39
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
Question five: Do you know ___ famous people?  

40
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:30,960
Question six, I have ___ small dog. Question 
seven, make sure to bring ___ umbrella.  

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:43,120
And finally eight, we didn't buy ___ bread. The 
correct answer for number one is any. Joe doesn't  

42
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:55,280
have any friends. Because this is a negative 
sentence we use any question to I'd like some  

43
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,760
cake please. This is a positive or affirmative 
sentence, so we use some. Now you might be  

44
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:10,880
confused about this word cake. And you might 
wonder, could we put I'd like a cake. And that  

45
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,960
would also be correct. If you wanted a cake, you 
would want the complete cake. If you say I'd like  

46
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:28,640
some cake, you want a piece of that cake? Question 
three, did you get any presents on your birthday?  

47
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,800
This is a request for information. We're 
trying to find out information. So we use any.  

48
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,800
Question four: the answer is some. Would 
you like some water? And that is because  

49
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,200
this is an offer. When we are offering 
something to someone, we use some.  

50
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,040
Number five: The answer is any. 
Do you know any famous people?  

51
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:07,200
Again, this is a question and it's also a 
request for information. Just like number three.  

52
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:19,360
Number six, the answer is a. I have a small 
dog. Dog is a singular countable noun.  

53
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:29,280
And we have small and that's a consonant sound. So 
we can't say an; we have to say a. Number seven,  

54
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:38,480
make sure to bring an umbrella because umbrella 
is a singular countable noun. And also it begins  

55
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:49,680
with a vowel sound. And finally, we didn't buy 
any bread. This is a negative sentence. So we  

56
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,200
have to use any. So let me know in the comment 
section how many you got correct out of eight.  

57
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,280
And if you had any difficulties, which ones were 
most difficult for you? If you have any questions,  

58
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,320
let me know in the comment section. Make sure to
