00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,400
Hi Everyone! I'm Arnel and today we're going to 
look at the past simple and the present perfect  

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,920
In today's lesson there are six 
steps and I'm gonna use a pyramid.  

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,200
We're going to start with the most obvious 
difference - the grammatical structure, then  

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:34,000
everything else is about finished and unfinished 
- not finished. Finished or unfinished time,  

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:46,240
life experiences, actions and that last one - 
connections to the present. The larger parts  

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,440
of the pyramid are pretty simple. It's that 
top part of the pyramid, in my experience,  

7
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,840
that students find the most confusing. Don't 
worry, I'm going to give you lots of examples.  

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:09,520
Let's start with the base - grammatical 
structure. verb 1 verb 2 and verb 3.  

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,800
We form the past simple: subject plus verb 2,  

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:26,000
and the present perfect: subject have has plus 
verb 3. Verb three is the past participle.  

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,560
For example, I ate a sandwich for lunch. 
I've eaten three sandwiches today.  

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,200
I'll keep the grammatical structures highlighted 
for you.Has or Have? It depends on your subject.  

13
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:56,800
Take a look. Use Has when your subject is 
HE, SHE or IT. Finished or Unfinished - time

14
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:09,280
I have a clock. My morning is from 7 to 
12. That's my morning. I worked very hard  

15
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,240
this morning. I've worked very hard this morning. 
Notice the contraction. When you're speaking,  

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,880
contract. So what's the difference between 
these two sentences? I worked very hard this  

17
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:33,920
morning. Now it's three o'clock. The morning 
is finished - use past simple. I've worked very  

18
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:42,720
hard this morning. Now it's 11, the morning isn't 
finished. It's unfinished - use present perfect

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,760
I have the month of February and I'm in the 
middle. Which sentence is correct? February  

20
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,880
was a successful month. February 
has been a successful month

21
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,760
The second one. February isn't over. I'm in the 
middle, we're in the middle of February now.

22
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:20,160
imagine now it's March. Then I could 
say: February was a successful month.

23
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:28,400
Okay look at this chart. Here you can see 
there's a lot of vocabulary we can use to show  

24
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,920
finished and unfinished time. With finish 
time, we have dates, years in the past.  

25
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:43,760
Things like yesterday, last week. For unfinished 
time, we have things that are still happening now.  

26
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,240
Today, this week, or even so 
far, recently, things like that.  

27
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Yesterday I went to the beach with my sister 
and we had a picnic. Yesterday, finished,  

28
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:04,880
past simple. Sue called me three hours ago. 
Past simple, three hours ago, finished time.  

29
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,840
I've had a headache all afternoon. It's only 
four o'clock, the afternoon isn't finished.

30
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:27,840
2021 has been a challenging year. It's only 
November. 2021 isn't finished yet, right?

31
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,000
Hello future viewers! If you're watching 
this video and it's not 2021, you need to say  

32
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,840
2021 was a challenging year.

33
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,520
Common mistake: Last month 
we have visited Lake Como.  

34
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:58,960
Last month is finished. Last month we visited 
Lake Como. Okay let's move on to life experiences.

35
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,960
Have you ever been to Canada? Have you ever  

36
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,680
broken a bone? Have you ever messaged the 
wrong person? I've been to Canada once.  

37
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,840
I've never broken a bone, and yeah I've 
messaged the wrong person five or six times.

38
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,600
We use a present perfect with life experiences  

39
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,640
because your life isn't finished 
yet. You're still alive.

40
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:40,320
The question: Have you ever. ? is really 
common. Have you ever been to Mount Rushmore?

41
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:51,840
Do I care about the "when"? No I don't care. 
You don't care. This lady doesn't care.

42
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,920
I went there two years ago, it was great, I took 
loads of pictures. Did you go with your family?  

43
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,880
No, it was actually a business 
trip. You can see the rest of  

44
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,520
the conversation is in the past simple because 
I've established a specific time - a specific  

45
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:23,360
finish time, two years ago. Now the "when" 
is important. Finished / unfinished actions.

46
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,000
Okay I have two sentences. I knew Lynn for 
one year. I've known Lynn for one year.  

47
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
We know the first one is past simple 
because of the grammatical structure  

48
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,360
and the second one is present 
perfect because of that grammar.  

49
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,840
But, when you're studying, you really don't 
want to isolate the grammar. Without context,  

50
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,120
no sentence really makes sense. Morning 
Al! I knew Lynn for three years!

51
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
We need some context, it's more 
natural. I knew Lynn for one year  

52
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,200
back in high school. We were good 
friend,s but her family moved away.

53
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,640
Past simple, I've given you a bit more 
context _ back in high school. I've  

54
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,200
only known Lynn for one year. We work 
together but we're not really close.  

55
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,560
Here, present perfect because we still work 
together. I've given you a bit more information.  

56
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,960
We can't talk about these two tenses 
without looking at for and since. So  

57
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:40,160
let's do a mini For and Since review. For 
plus duration, since plus starting point.  

58
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:50,240
What does that mean? For plus duration: for 
ten years, four eight months, for five hours.  

59
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,240
Since plus starting point. When did 
something start? From when? since 2011,  

60
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,840
since March. Those are my starting 
points. I've lived here for 10 years.  

61
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:14,320
I've had a bad shoulder since summer. For and 
Since are really common with the present perfect  

62
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,640
because they show us that something is 
continuing up to now. I still live here.  

63
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,920
My shoulder still hurts. Can we use For and 
Since with the past simple? We can use FOR.  

64
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:39,280
My grandparents were married for 60 years. I 
lived there for 10 years. We don't use Since  

65
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:53,840
with the past simple because Since means something 
is continuing up to now. I lived here since 2011.

66
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:03,680
But! I've met thousands of students since I 
started teaching. I've met - present perfect.  

67
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:11,120
I'm still teaching now, great. Since I 
started? What? Since plus past simple?  

68
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:21,600
In this sentence here, Since plus I started, is 
my starting point. I'm not saying my starting  

69
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,000
is continuing up to the present. Let me give you 
the same sentence, but I'll change things around  

70
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:37,280
a little bit. I've met thousands of people since 
2010. Same information, I'm just using different  

71
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:43,520
vocabulary. To summarize: Don't use the past 
simple with since if you're trying to express  

72
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:53,760
up to now. Use since plus past simple if that 
past simple time was your starting point. Let's  

73
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,240
move on to that last part - connections to 
the present. A connection to the present.

74
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh man, Kevin has already booked the meeting room.  

75
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,960
The police have taped off the 
path I use to walk to work.  

76
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,160
Both of these past actions have an impact on 
my present. How do I know that? Because without  

77
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:29,200
these actions, my life wouldn't be different now. 
Now I can't book the meeting room. Thanks Kevin!

78
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,840
Now I need to walk the long way to work. 
So there's a connection to the present.  

79
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,400
Does anyone here speak Russian? 
Kyle's been to Russia loads of times.  

80
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:53,360
Notice my contraction. Let's ask him. Maybe he 
can help us. We see the present perfect a lot  

81
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:03,840
in the news because past actions impact us now, 
right? New Covid restrictions have complicated  

82
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:11,440
plans to reopen air travel between the US and 
the UK. Teachers have expressed concerns over  

83
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,600
recent cyber bullying cases. Okay, let's 
get a little bit more conversational.

84
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,880
I've sprained my ankle, so 
I can't go on a skiing trip.  

85
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,800
I've received some bad news from my 
doctor. I really don't know how to feel.  

86
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,800
We're out of coffee pods. Don't 
worry, I've already ordered some.

87
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,840
Because of my sprained ankle, now I can't go 
on that skiing trip. Because of the bad news,  

88
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:53,680
now I don't know how I feel. I ordered coffee 
pods, now you can relax. But, Americans usually  

89
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:59,920
don't use the present perfect when we have this 
past to present connection. If something's done,  

90
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:08,880
it's done. So I could say: I sprained my 
ankle, I received some bad news, I already  

91
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,480
ordered some. Keep that difference in mind when 
you're listening to podcasts or watching movies.

92
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,920
Okay are you ready for a big review?

93
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,960
Both tenses have different grammatical 
structures. Verb 2 for past simple.  

94
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,040
Have/Has plus verb three, past 
participle - for the present perfect  

95
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,880
It's all about something that is finished 
or unfinished - time. Finished: I drank three  

96
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,880
cups of coffee yesterday. Unfinished: 
I've drunk three cups of coffee today.  

97
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:55,040
Life experiences. Finished: My grandma went to over 
50 countries. Unfortunately, she's not alive now.  

98
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,400
Unfinished: She's been to over 50 
countries. She's still alive. Actions.  

99
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:13,680
Finished: I lived there for 20 years. Unfinished: 
I have lived here for 20 years. Connection to  

100
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,560
the present: You don't need to cook. I've just 
ordered a large pizza. This is correct, but many  

101
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,320
times, Americans prefer to use the past simple .
You don't need to cook. I just ordered a pizza.

102
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,640
Well done. I know there was a lot 
of information in today's lesson,  

103
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:44,400
so leave me a comment down below, and I 
can't wait to see you soon. Thank you. Bye!
