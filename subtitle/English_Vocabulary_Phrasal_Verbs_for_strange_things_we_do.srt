1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,199
hello i'm gonna i'm gonna cook something

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,160
my name is ronnie

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,200
um but i need my tongs and

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,160
oh gotta make sure they work why do we

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,040
do that

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,280
when when you grab the tongs out of the

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,719
drawer which is

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,880
the thing that you store them in why do

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,400
we always test them

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
what's that like oh i think they broke

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,840
in the drawer overnight but

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,880
these are tongs and this lesson is about

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,800
doing some really

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,840
crazy strange things as humans i think

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,439
that you're human

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,320
are you a robot

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,079
no okay i'm a human and i do some really

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,640
weird things so for example

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,239
i wear mascara and every time i put on

20
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,280
mascara

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,840
i do this

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,440
okay let me demonstrate i'm going to put

23
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,719
on mascara and i

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,760
always have to open my mouth i could do

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,800
it like this but i have to do this

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,239
why do we do that are we eating

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
something are we expecting food to fly

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,760
in our mouths

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,040
i got a biscuit oh great no

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,360
no we're just really kind of strange

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,560
humans aren't we

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,680
um so ask yourself

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
why do i do these things

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,840
why do you open your mouth

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,360
to put on mascara now if you actually

36
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,400
look at this sentence

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,520
put on is a phrasal verb you're going to

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
learn some phrasal verbs

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,159
so a phrasal verb means that there's a

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,200
verb

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,479
and a preposition so we

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,759
put on some kind of makeup put on

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,640
mascara

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
put on blush eyeshadow i don't know what

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,439
you ladies apply but

46
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,240
whatever you're putting on it looks

47
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,960
great

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,840
so put on means apply

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,040
do you drive a car or have you been in a

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,360
car

51
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
yes we have why

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,119
you're driving along got the tunes

53
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,000
cranked

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
which means up really high you have to

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,919
find an address

56
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,239
even google map says you have arrived at

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,200
your destination

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,400
but you got to turn down the music you

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,120
will never

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
be able to find the address unless you

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,560
turn the music down

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,040
no no your eyes are like no i'm just

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,640
don't i can't see anything until you

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,400
turn the music down

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
it has to work with our delicious brains

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
and

67
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,319
it's about distraction i'm telling you

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,959
the answer why okay

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,319
if we have too many sounds or too much

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,800
confusion in our heads we can't focus on

71
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,720
one thing enough so

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,239
that's the answer that's why we turned

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,800
down the radio

74
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,440
to find an address why we open our mouth

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,680
when we put on mascara

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,720
uh kind of opens our eyes more

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,319
yeah we're just really strange humans

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,200
alright let's go to the next one

79
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,440
turn down is a phrasal verb so turn down

80
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,319
something means you

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,280
decrease so we turn down the radio we're

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
actually turning down the volume

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
of the radio but we just say the radio

84
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,879
it's like

85
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,800
take the radio turn it no it's not

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
working so turn down the volume

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,640
um i do this so turn off the lights

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,840
when we leave the room now this is a

89
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,879
good habit

90
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,959
okay so i'm i'm proud that i do this

91
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,840
ronnie's saving energy

92
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,720
but sometimes there's other people in

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,000
the room

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,239
so i leave the room total darkness to

95
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
the other people oh my god

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,519
ronnie why did you turn off the lights

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,280
oh because

98
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,920
i left the room it doesn't work like

99
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,480
that

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,440
um so be careful it's a good habit to

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,400
get into

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,920
when you leave the room turn off the

103
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,159
lights just make sure there's no other

104
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,560
people

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,840
enjoying something what are you enjoying

106
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,040
um this happens to me

107
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,239
every day because i live

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,040
in a place that has an elevator and

109
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,799
elevators are quite fascinating actually

110
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,239
there's lots of stuff you can do in them

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:12,959
brano

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,920
keep it up um but

113
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,439
you're waiting for the elevator

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,080
and the elevator finally comes you stand

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,000
right in front of the elevator door

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,320
the door opens oh my god and there's

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,199
people

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,720
what there's other people

119
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,600
in the elevator already and they they

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
scare you like

121
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
how are there people in the elevator the

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,560
door opens you look up

123
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,680
people sometimes other people scream

124
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,600
kind of like doing this i have a dog and

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,120
sometimes a dog comes out first and

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,639
scares the people and

127
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,560
he's just a small guy but people are

128
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
weird so

129
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,360
we never never we never fathom which

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,840
means

131
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,320
think that there is another person

132
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,680
already in the elevator we think

133
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,759
the elevator is always empty it's always

134
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,680
for us i called it ding

135
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,560
it's here oh there there's another

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
person in the elevator get them out of

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,080
there

138
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,600
here's another phrasal verb to throw

139
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,960
something out or throw out something

140
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,160
this means you put it in the garbage so

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
a lot of the times you're making a

142
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,320
packet of something maybe you're making

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,479
craft dinner because you're in canada or

144
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,840
you're cooking something that has

145
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,960
instructions

146
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,600
so you rip open the box or the bag or

147
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
the package

148
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,479
put the crap in your pot

149
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,759
throw out the box

150
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,680
oh my god i have no idea how to cook

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,199
this what am i going to do

152
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,120
how long do i cook it for what's the

153
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
next step you have just thrown out all

154
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,960
of the magical answers

155
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,080
to the world right in the garbage

156
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,240
but why do they put the instructions on

157
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,759
the box

158
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,039
why not put it inside that would help us

159
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,840
so throwing out cooking instructions

160
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,440
it's kind of a stupid thing that we do

161
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,160
i do this i really honestly do this to

162
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,800
you

163
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,000
pack extra gitch

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,319
now let's just find out what these words

165
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,600
mean pack

166
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
so this means i'm going to go someplace

167
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,280
on vacation

168
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,479
or a night trip or to some place and i

169
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,720
need a change of clothes

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,039
pack means you put the things into your

171
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,039
bag okay

172
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,560
extra means more than you need and gitch

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
apparently is a slur slang term for

174
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,080
underwear

175
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,400
i've said it my whole life and it's kind

176
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,759
of a cool thing to say now

177
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,280
nice gitch so we always

178
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,240
i always pack extra git and i think to

179
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
myself

180
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
i'm going to put these in just in case i

181
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,440
ship myself because

182
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,800
i'm prepared to do that because it's

183
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,360
going to be a crazy time when i go

184
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,599
on a road trip but we always do this

185
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,440
we're like we need extra underwear

186
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,120
it's like we think or we prepare

187
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
yourself for the worst

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
oh i'm gonna get diarrhea if i go to

189
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,919
mcdonald's

190
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,919
and i definitely gonna need that extra

191
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,680

194
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,080
and then if you do actually have

195
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,599
diarrhea you're gonna have to go to a

196
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
public washroom

197
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,440
and most of them have locks

198
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,599
which is fantastic to have a lock on a

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,720
public bathroom

200
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,400
and you can say bathroom or washroom

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,319
doesn't matter um

202
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,919

203
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,240
taking a rest in there what are you

205
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
in the public washrooms you knock on the

206
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,759
door

207
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,360
and what do you say when you're in there

208
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,280
um hello

how awkward now in our crazy world of

288
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
coronavirus we're only allowed to have

289
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,519
one other person

290
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,640
in the elevator with us yes so it's not

291
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,959
as

292
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,320
awkward but you're still like what do i

293
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:50,720
say

294
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
where do i look where do i put my eyes

295
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,079
oh damn i can look at the little lights

296
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,880
as they light up now my building's quite

297
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,519
modern

298
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,640
and we don't have the little lights

299
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,279
across the top we have a number plate

300
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,480
digital two three

301
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,440
four it doesn't talk but we always look

302
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,279
at this

303
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,880
we just stare at that we could look at

304
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,560
our shoes that would be better

305
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,720
but we always stare at the numbers you

306
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,920
could look at the person well

307
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,440
don't look at the people they'll think

308
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,200
that you're weird if this is your mask

309
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,800
then you try and talk to them get on the

310
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
phone just shut up

311
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
and stare at the numbers it'll work

312
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,680
great

313
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,399
and then oh the other person's off the

314
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,680
elevator then we can look anywhere we

315
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,399

316
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,800
ah yeah how's my hair huh where's my

317
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,240
shoes we can do that

318
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,920
um one time i was doing something

319
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,120
and i had no idea where my glasses were

320
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,399
okay and i was oh my god

321
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,720
i know i had my sunglasses i know that i

322
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,399
put them someplace

323
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,279
and i looked in my car i got out

324
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,160
looked around

325
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,480
they're on my head

326
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,720
so

327
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,399
i know i put lots of things on my head

328
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,079
it's my new storage compartment

329
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,079
but why do you always forget this you

330
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,360
know they're there you look in the

331
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
mirror like no

332
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,360
not there um this one is a

333
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,839
terrible habit that we have okay when we

334
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,399
click on ads

335
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,040
so this means with your mouse which is

336
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,240
weird it's a mouse

337
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
not a dog or a rat or a cat it's a mouse

338
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,000
and we're looking

339
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,279
at something

340
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,279
and we don't want this ad there but they

341
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,320
do this on purpose

342
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,720
there's a little tiny x you can't see

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,440
the x

344
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,880
but it's tiny ah

345
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,760
pollock's actually clapped on it and

346
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
that

347
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,200
adds an extras like three seconds before

348
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,560
you actually get to watch my next

349
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,440
youtube video

350
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
and you have to wait that three seconds

351
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,760
or one minute even oh after the ads

352
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,120
don't click on the ads

353
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,279
you go oh i clicked on the ads again

354
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,360

355
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,320

356
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,160
on something

357
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,360
now this means that i

358
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
press my mouse button if you have a

359
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,200

i can click on something and i press it

361
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,399
um

362
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,240

thing for missing children or things

373
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,360
