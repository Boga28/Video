1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,670
Okay. Sometimes when you're
speaking English or you're

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:12,510
online, you have problems
because you're in sticky

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,620
situations. So, "sticky
situations" means that you feel

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,860
uncomfortable or you don't
really know what to say, or how

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,800
to act, because someone has made
you feel weird.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,240
So, I'm here to help you about
this. And job interviews. Oh my

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,140
god - the worst. People ask you
questions. You're like: "Oh, I

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,150
don't know. I don't know. I
don't know." Don't tell them the

9
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,960
truth. Don't tell them that
you're.  "Oh, okay." So, if

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,440
English is not your first
language, or if it is, sometimes

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,010
we help dealing with things. So,
let's get into this.

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:48,120
Where do these things happen?
So, uncomfortable questions can

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,790
happen when you're outside
walking your dog, they can

14
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,020
happen on social media; sticky,
sticky situations. Facebook,

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,570
Instagram, YouTube, comments or
messages.

16
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,770
I have a YouTube channel; you're
watching it. And people say

17
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,620
things like.  That are just
wrong. And that I take thing. 

18
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,560
They take what I say and make it
very different from what happens

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,310
from reality. That's a dangerous
thing. Know what you're

20
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,890
commenting on, first of all, and
know how to comment back.

21
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:24,509
If you're on Facebook, and
people are saying bad things

22
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,959
about you - this.  This can be
terrible, especially if you'r

23
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,389
 younger and you're ver
 vulnerable. So, make sure tha

24
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,239
 you know how to handl
 yourselves in this situation

25
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,259
 Because if you type a comment
 and then you type an answer; an

26
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,749
 then they answer: "Blah, blah
 blah", it can get very, ver

27
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:45,539
 dangerous out there. There'
 many examples of people gettin

28
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,959
 killed, people getting sho
 because of Facebook social medi

29
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,879
 comments. Careful

30
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:54,149
These can happen in real life.
So, someone could say to you:

31
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:57,389
"Oh, hey. How old are you?"
That's none of your business.

32
00:01:57,389 --> 00:02:02,789
Really? Is it? Which can be a
legitimate question, if it's

33
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,659
your friend or someone; but if
it's a stranger - no, no. That's

34
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,989
not their business. "How much
money do you make?" These are

35
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,559
considered rude questions. And
when someone asks you them,

36
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:17,519
you're put in a ver
 uncomfortable situation. And yo

37
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:19,919
 want to tell the truth, but yo
 know you shouldn't, and: Wha

38
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,690
 are you going to do

39
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:27,500
-"Hey, sweetheart. Can I get
your phone number?" -"Oh, I.  I

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,460
don't have a phone." Ring-ring.
"Mom, that's a bad time to call

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,570
me now." So, what do you do if
somebody says: "Hey, sweetheart.

42
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,520
Can I have your phone number?"
You say: "No." And then the

43
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,090
person is like: -"Well, why
not?" -"Because I don't want

44
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,350
to." -"How old are you?" -"It's
not your business." -"How much

45
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,910
money do you make?" -"Why?"

46
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,130
You can ask them a question.
"Why do you want to know how

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,370
much money I. ? How much money
do you make?" Oh! You can ask

48
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,970
them a question back. -"How old
are you?" -"How old are you? Do

49
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,950
you want to know how old my dog
is, too? It's not your

50
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:01,370
business."

51
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,360
So, you have two options, here.
One: You can give them a

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,620
"snarky", which means sarcastic
answer, like I usually do. Or,

53
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,160
following the voice of my mom:
You can choose to ignore the

54
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,670
people. This isn't as fun,
though. Oh. It means you're not

55
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,070
playing the game, are you? So,
the solution to social media and

56
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,980
real-life problems: You say
nothing.

57
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,070
Somebody types nasty comments
about you on your Facebook page,

58
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,970
or on your Instagram, or on your
YouTube channel - you say

59
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,370
nothing; you don't reply.
Nothing. Nothing. Absolutely.

60
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,450
Because: Why? They're waiting
for you to say something.

61
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,400
These people are called:
"keyboard warriors". "Warriors",

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,370
like a soldier. And "keyboard"
is the thing that you type on.

63
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,780
So, these "keyboard warriors"
have nothing better to do than

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,340
sit on YouTube, and comment on
people's videos. Well, get a

65
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,880
hobby, go ride a bike, go walk
outside. Okay? Because their

66
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,020
lives are so terribly tragic,
that they can think: "Oh, I'm

67
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,930
going to go on people's videos
and leave these bad comments."

68
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:07,920
Okay.

69
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,030
Also known as "trolls". "Trolls"
go through videos and say:

70
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,720
"Ah-ha-ha. I'm going to leave a
bad comment. And I'm going to

71
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,529
call this person this name."
Nice grade three. Okay? Go back

72
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,220
to grade three; get off your
keyboard. But say nothing.

73
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,920
That's what my Mom told me. So,
I don't like that. I like to

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,610
fight.

75
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,630
So, maybe you're in a job
interview and they ask you a

76
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,360
question. Frank, thank you very
much for giving me this advice.

77
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:49,040
And you have no idea what the
answer, because job interviews

78
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,220
are sticky. They.  They ask you
something, but you know you

79
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,410
shouldn't tell the truth because
then you'll lose the job.

80
00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:01,700
Hey, guess what? You can say to
them: "Let me get back to you on

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:07,940
that one." So, they could ask
you a question, like: "So, why

82
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:12,740
exactly would you like to work
for this company?" Real answer:

83
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,330
"I need a job. And you had a job
interview, and I'm here. And you

84
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,280
should hire me." Bad answer.
Good answer: "That's a good

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,870
question."--I have no idea--"Let
me get back to you on that one."

86
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,220
So, hopefully what will happen
is the interview will be very

87
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,500
happy with your answer, continue
with the job interview, and

88
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,600
completely forget to go back and
ask you the question you

89
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,440
couldn't remember or you didn't
know the answer to. It's magic.

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,800
Because the job interviews:
"Dunh-dunh-dunh" done all these,

91
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,820
good. Okay. Yes/no. Hired. Good.
They forget to ask you most of

92
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,090
the time, unless you've got a
genius working on your job

93
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,540
interview.

94
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,780
The other thing that you can say
is.  They might ask you

95
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,400
something you're not comfortable
about at all, and you're going

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,160
to find out that there's many
things that they're not allowed

97
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,430
to ask you. They're not allowed
to ask you about your age, your

98
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,090
race, and many other
discriminatory things in a job

99
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,120
interview. And if they ask you
one of these things, or

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,840
something that you're just like:
"No. Do you know what? Nah. No,

101
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,800
no, no."

102
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,862
You can say: "I'm not
comfortable talking about that."

103
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,239
And this might set off a little
alarm for the interview, going:

104
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:34,069
"Oh. Did I say something
illegal? Well, I hope that was

105
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:38,104
allowed in my jurisdiction." So,
it actually makes the job

106
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:41,729
interview.  Interviewer
nervous. You're like: "Yes.

107
00:06:41,797 --> 00:06:43,430
Ha-ha. Give me the job."

108
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,430
It's a crazy world out there,
and people are going to attack

109
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,370
you, but stay strong. And if
something makes you

110
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:53,540
uncomfortable, talk about it.
Say things: "Ha. Hey, guess

111
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,910
what? I'm not playing your
games. Bye."
