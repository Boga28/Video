Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa  

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,920
from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Huh? 
What did you say? Let's talk about it. 

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,240
Have you ever been watching your favorite movie 
or TV show and decided to turn it to English and  

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,800
then, "Oh my goodness, it's so fast. How in the 
world are they talking so fast? I can't understand  

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,160
this." Well, don't worry. You are not alone. Many 
English learners have had that same sensation  

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,080
of, "Oh, it's so fast. I will never understand 
this." Well, I have some good news. In today's  

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,920
lesson, you are going to learn five 
secrets to understanding fast English,  

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,320
improving your listening skills, and 
understanding movies and TV shows. 

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,000
To help you master today's lesson, I have 
created a free PDF worksheet just for you,  

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,240
my beloved students, so that you can download 
this worksheet, study these five secrets, check  

11
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,440
out all of the tips and ideas that are mentioned 
in today's lesson. And at the end of the PDF,  

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,240

so that you can use what you have learned in this  

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,360
lesson. Don't forget to click on the link below 
this video to download the free PDF worksheet. 

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,320
Let's get started with the first 
secret. Problem number one,  

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,040
don't watch a movie or TV show that you are 
unfamiliar with, or you only understand 10%.  

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,640
That's so frustrating. Instead, apply secret 
number one. Watch a movie or a TV show that you  

17
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,440
already know in your native language. You are 
already familiar with the story, the characters,  

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,720
possibly even some of the words. If you 
need to use English subtitles, go ahead.  

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,880
But this is a great way to let go of fear, to 
let go of the frustration, "I can't understand.  

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,080
I only understand every couple words and 
it's just too much." No, watch something  

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,440
that you already know in your native language.
Have you seen Disney's Frozen in your native  

22
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,280
language? Great, watch it in English. Have 
you seen Forrest Gump in your native language?  

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,640
Excellent, watch it in English. This is a great 
way to feel more confident and to improve your  

24
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,000
listening skills to understand fast English.
Problem number two, don't study how individual  

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,760
words are pronounced. Instead, follow secret 
number two, which will help you to overcome  

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:37,280
this problem and that is study some common 
linking expressions in English. For example,  

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,320
if you ask me, "Vanessa, where are you going?" 
And I say, "I'm 'onna go to the mountains."  

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,280
Okay, maybe you understood a couple parts of this, 
but do you really understand the linking that is  

29
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,800
happening so that when other people say this, 
who are not your English teacher, you can get it? 

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,480
Let's break down this sentence, "I'm 'onna 
to go to the mountains." I'm onna...Well,  

31
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,080
I'm really saying I am going to. First, I'm 
using a contraction. I am becomes I'm. And then,  

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,720
I'm pushing together, or linking together 
'going to' which often becomes gonna. "I'm gonna  

33
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,760
take a nap. I'm gonna study English." But we 
can reduce it even further and cut off the G,  

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,320
and say, "I'm 'onna," which is what I said 
earlier. I'm onna, I'm onna. If you're  

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:37,120
listening for, "I am going to," you will not 
get this. But if you understand some common  

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,720
linking principles in English, contractions, 
"Going to" becomes "Gonna," or becomes,  

37
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,360
"'Onna," your ears will be more aware of it.
Let's go to the last part of that sentence.  

38
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,680
"I'm 'onna go to the mountains, go 
duh the mountains. Go duh. The word to  

39
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:01,120
becomes duh. This is very common after the 
verb go. "Go duh the mountains. I'm gonna go  

40
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,480
duh school tomorrow." Go duh school. "I got duh 
go to duh office." Go duh the office. Excellent. 

41
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,560
What's happening with that last word, mountains? 
Mountains. Well, often, if there is a T plus  

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,560
N sound at the end of a word, we drop 
the T and kind of swallow that sound.  

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,200
Listen to these other words that 
are very similar. Button becomes  

44
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:40,320
but-n. But-n. Threaten becomes threat-n. 
Threat-n. And Mountain becomes mount-n. Mount-n. 

45
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,400
Now you can say this word clearly and say, I'm 
onna go to the mountains, mountains. It's okay.  

46
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,520
But you're going to hear people say, you're gonna, 
I just used that reduction, you're going to hear  

47
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,240
people say mountains, and you need to be able to 
understand it. We are all focusing on improving  

48
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,840
your listening skills for comprehension so that 
you can understand how people are speaking in  

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,840
daily conversations. So with this one very 
simple sentence, you learn some key phrases. 

50
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,880
I'm 'onna go duh the mountains
Can you say that with me? Let's  

51
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,960
have a little pronunciation practice. 
Also when you improve your pronunciation,  

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,800
you're also improving your listening, so they 
are linked together. Let's say it together. 

53
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm gonna go to the mountains. I'm gonna to 
the mountains. I'm gonna go to the mountains.  

54
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,960
I'm gonna to go to the mountains. Lovely.
Problem number three is don't get discouraged.  

55
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,560
A lot of English learners try to watch something 
in fast English, or they have a business meeting  

56
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
where people are speaking so comfortably 
in English. And they're just sitting there,  

57
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,960
fearful. "Please don't ask me a question, 
please don't call on me to speak",  

58
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,400
because they can't understand the conversation 
that's happening. And this can be really  

59
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,120
discouraging. You feel like you'll never be able 
to actually understand what people are saying.  

60
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,800
So we need to just take it slow. I know we're 
talking about fast English here, but don't  

61
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:18,320
expect yourself to be able to understand English 
overnight. This is a journey. This is a process.  

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,040
So a problem that a lot of English learners have 
is that they get discouraged too quickly and  

63
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,720
they're not realistic about it. So, let's see how 
secret number three can help you with this secret. 

64
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:38,240
Number three is to take some notes. Whenever 
you hear something fast, take a note about it,  

65
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,960
write it down in a notebook, write it down on your 
phone. And when you learn one new quick phrase,  

66
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,720
every day, this will build and build and build 
over time. So let me help you do this today.  

67
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,080
Take a look at this sentence. I got to go well, 
if you're in a hurry and you're at a friend's  

68
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,320
house and you look at the time, I got to go, I'm 
going to be late. This is a great phrase to use,  

69
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,480
but what's happening here. There are a lot of 
reductions, a lot of things that are cut out.  

70
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,760
We could say, I have got to go. This means I 
need to leave, right now. I have got to go.  

71
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,800
But when we reduce that, we cut 
out 'have' and 'got to' becomes  

72
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,200
gotta, gotta, but we don't pronounce the T.
So we're going to reduce it one more time. And  

73
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:37,120
in American English, the Ts change to a D sound. 
Listen, when I say it, I gotta go. I gotta go. I  

74
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:42,720
gotta go. Oh, sorry. I gotta go, I'm going to 
be late. I gotta go. Can you say that with me?  

75
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:52,640
Sorry, I gotta go. Sorry, I gotta go. Great. You 
just learned one normal and casual and natural  

76
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,600
reduced English phrase. You did it, great. So 
now I hope you feel a little bit less discouraged  

77
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,160
because you conquered that mountain, mountain.
Problem number four, that I see a lot of my  

78
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,320
English students making is don't just speak with 
yourself or your pet. This is a good starting  

79
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:20,400
point, but really to overcome that, secret number 
four is you need to speak with someone else.  

80
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,000
There is nothing like having a 
real-time conversation with someone. 

81
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,159
Do you know what real-time means? It means it's 
happening at that second. You can't pause and  

82
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:39,119
rewind and go back. No, if you don't understand 
at that second there's real world consequences,  

83
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,520
because you're going to need them to repeat. 
You're going to have to ask them, "Sorry,  

84
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,960
I didn't catch that. Can you repeat it?". Or 
you're just going to stand there and smile. So  

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,520
speaking with someone else in a real-time 
conversation is going to test listening  

86
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,680
skills and also help you to find the holes 
in what's difficult for you. Maybe you can  

87
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,760
understand some topics, but other topics it's too 
much. I know that when I was living in France,  

88
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,560
as my French listening skills grew, I could 
understand a lot of people, but for some reason,  

89
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,400
there was the father of my host family, 
I could not understand him at all. 

90
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,120
There was ways that he was linking or reducing 
French expressions, the way that he was  

91
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,200
mumbling. It was so challenging. And finally, when 
I could understand him, I felt so proud of myself.  

92
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,000
So it is essential to be able to have real time 
conversations with someone else. If you feel  

93
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,120
like that might be a little too scary for you 
right now, or maybe you're not in a situation  

94
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,960
where you can find someone else to speak with, 
a good starting point is to check out my series,  

95
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:54,240
speak with me. You can click on the link up 
here. In these videos I will give you some key  

96
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,320
vocabulary, some key questions, and we will have 
a little mini conversation practice together. The  

97
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,280
good thing about this type of practice is that 
it's kind of real time, but you can also pause  

98
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,960
the video and go back and practice it again. So 
I hope this will be a good tool to help you with  

99
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,680
this secret number four, speak with somebody else.
Problem number five that I see a lot of English  

100
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:25,840
learners make is they just watch English lessons 
on YouTube, like this one. And while that's great,  

101
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:33,840
you can't only do that. You also need to be able 
to practice real conversation, listening skills,  

102
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,240
because that's what happens in the real 
world. Whether you're watching a TV show,  

103
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,120
whether you're talking with someone at a hotel, 
whether you're talking with a client on the phone,  

104
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,200
it's not exactly an English teacher who speaks 
clearly and understandably and understands that  

105
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,840
you're an English learner. Nope, it's important to 
step that up. So if you can already understand me  

106
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,680
pretty well, maybe you're using subtitles, maybe 
not, that's okay, what if we added one more person  

107
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,120
to my conversation? What if we added someone who 
speaks a little bit clearly too? Like my husband,  

108
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,920
Dan, check out this clip. See how you feel. Can 
you understand generally what we're talking about? 

109
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,000
Dan:
Can I say my second worst job? 

110
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,720
Vanessa:
Yeah, sure. 

111
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,920
Dan:
Can you guess what it is? 

112
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,760
Vanessa:
I know you worked at a lot of coffee shops,  

113
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,960
but those weren't that bad.
Dan: 

114
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,640
Working at a coffee shop is good.
Vanessa: 

115
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,400
Okay, what was it?
Dan: 

116
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
It's Sharpshooter.
Vanessa: 

117
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,320
Can you explain about that job?
Dan: 

118
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,120
Yeah. So I don't know if you've ever seen this 
in your country, but have you ever been to a  

119
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,920
place where somebody takes your picture and 
then later they try to sell you that picture?  

120
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,160
I was that guy. So we took the same 
pictures. It was going onto a boat,  

121
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,920
on one of the rivers in Pittsburgh,
Vanessa: 

122
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,240
Kind of like a cruise boat, but river cruise.
Dan: 

123
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,440
It was very kitschy though. Not high class at 
all. So people, before they got on the boat,  

124
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,560
we forced them to stop and go through the 
line and we'd take their picture. And it  

125
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,840
was like required, but people were like, 
"I don't want to get my picture taken". 

126
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,200
Vanessa:
Everyone had their own cameras  

127
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
and phones, they didn't need that.
Dan: 

128
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,720
Yeah. Mind you this in like 2010 where people 
already had phones on their cameras and stuff.  

129
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,480
That's at least getting more popular.
Vanessa: 

130
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,480
They didn't need your picture.
Dan: 

131
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,200
And so I had to take everybody's picture. And 
then when they got off the boat, I stood at  

132
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:29,920
the side and said, "Hey, come over here, buy this 
picture". And they were like $20 for one picture,  

133
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,040
terrible rip off. Even I knew it was a terrible 
rip off, just not a worthwhile business, at least  

134
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,520
in 2010 when I was doing that job.
Vanessa: 

135
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,840
Maybe 10 years before that, 
it would have been cool. 

136
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,400
Dan:
It was a viable business like  

137
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,760
30 years ago.
Vanessa: 

138
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,680
Okay, maybe that went all right for you. 
But what if we added a different speaker  

139
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,000
who speaks a little bit faster and maybe 
the topic isn't so comfortable for you?  

140
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,200
Check out this clip and watch what we're saying.
Brandi: 

141
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,000
So there's a lot of different factors that go into 
play and it takes, that's why like, especially in  

142
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,280
this market, it's great to work with a realtor.
Vanessa: 

143
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:10,960
We would have had no clue what to do. I pretty 
much guarantee we would never have gotten this  

144
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,560
house without you.
Brandi: 

145
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,880
I'm so glad it worked out. It's so cool to 
see. I've always feel like people land in  

146
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,120
the right places, even if it's a little 
tricky. They lose out on a few houses,  

147
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,360
it's always a bummer, but people always land in 
the place that they're meant to be. And I always  

148
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,520
keep that heart, like when somebody loses, it's 
just knowing that that wasn't the right thing. 

149
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,200
Vanessa:
Yeah, that wasn't the destiny that  

150
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,440
was meant to happen. Another place would come up.
Was it a little bit more challenging? What about  

151
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,840
the next step? What if we took out the video 
completely and you only listened to our voices?  

152
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,320
Check out this quick clip where 
you're going to only listen to the  

153
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,840
audio of me speaking with my friend, who's 
here in that past video, Brandi. Listen. 

154
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,320
Brandi:
If it's possible, pay off a car,  

155
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,200
it's a big chunk of change, but sometimes lenders 
will say it's more important to pay off your car  

156
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,320
than it is to put this towards a down payment. 
So sometimes a lender, a good lender again,  

157
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,480
is an important thing, because they can help guide 
you as to what makes the most sense to help you  

158
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,320
get the house that you really want.
Vanessa: 

159
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:24,160
It's a little bit tougher in that situation. What 
if you had a teacher to guide you someone nice,  

160
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,200
someone helpful, maybe someone like me, someone 
who could guide you through all of those  

161
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,360
challenging conversations who could introduce you 
and explain new vocabulary and who could help you  

162
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:42,400
to not feel so overwhelmed when you're listening 
to fast English. You would be able to understand  

163
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:47,520
fast English like never before, and maybe 
you would even have fun. I'd like to
