1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,600
Well, hello and welcome to
this English lesson about rain.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,200
It's a rainy day here in Ontario, Canada,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,670
so I thought it would be a good time

4
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,860
to go outside with my camera.

5
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,510
Hopefully I don't get soaked.

6
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,420
Hopefully I don't get too wet,

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,800
and do a little English lesson about rain.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,020
So in this English lesson,

9
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,950
I'll help you learn some words and phrases

10
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,138
you can use to talk about
a rainy day in English.

11
00:00:22,138 --> 00:00:24,888
(cheerful music)

12
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,790
I want to start this
English lesson about rain

13
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,310
by talking about two words.

14
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,490
I want to talk about the word
rain and the word showers,

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,350
and sometimes we actually
even put them together

16
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,870
and say rain showers.

17
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,000
We use both of those words
to talk about a rainy day.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,240
In fact, the weather forecast this morning

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,760
said, "Rain, heavy at times,"

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,070
and then on a different part
of the weather forecast,

21
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,840
it said, "Showers today, heavy at times,"

22
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,200
So you can use those words
somewhat interchangeably.

23
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,400
You can also put them
together, like I said before.

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,800
You could say rain showers.

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,270
There's gonna be a few rain showers today.

26
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,250
In fact, the rain's getting
a little heavier as I speak.

27
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:07,120
I really hope I don't get too
wet while I make this lesson.

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,200
Before we move on, though,
with the rest of the lesson,

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,780
if this is your first time here,

30
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,690
don't forget to click
that red subscribe button

31
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,890
and give me a thumbs up if
this video helps you learn

32
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,290
just a little bit more English.

33
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,070
Now let's continue with the lesson.

34
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,620
I should also tell you the difference

35
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,250
between a rainstorm and a thunderstorm.

36
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,100
Sometimes it rains for a long time,

37
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,720
and it rains really, really hard,

38
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,530
and we would call it a rainstorm,

39
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,700
but only if there's no
thunder and no lightning.

40
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,600
If it rained for a long period of time,

41
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,900
and it was really heavy rain

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,510
and there was thunder and lightning,

43
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,400
we would then call it a thunderstorm.

44
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,380
So really, the only difference is that,

45
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,020
with a rainstorm, there's
no thunder or lightning,

46
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,260
and with a thunderstorm,

47
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,130
there's usually lots of
thunder and lightning.

48
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,280
That's really the only difference.

49
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,680
Here in Ontario, Canada,
there's really four basic ways

50
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,690
to describe the kind of
rain that you are getting.

51
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,810
We usually say it's spitting.

52
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,940
That means that if you go outside,

53
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,260
the odd raindrop will hit
you every once in a while.

54
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,480
If it gets a little harder,

55
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,600
we would probably say it's drizzling.

56
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,500
It's actually drizzling right now.

57
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,150
You can see a little bit of
rain on my jacket, maybe.

58
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,540
It's not coming down super hard.

59
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,440
The next level would be to
simply say it's raining.

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,400
It's a pretty basic description,

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,780
but when you say it's raining,

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,400
it's probably raining hard
enough that you need an umbrella,

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,970
but it's not raining so hard

64
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,370
that you're worried about going outside.

65
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,200
And then the last way we would describe it

66
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,110
is we would say it's pouring.

67
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,640
When it's pouring outside,

68
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,250
the rain is coming down in buckets.

69
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,840
Rain is just falling out
of the sky at a rapid rate,

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,180
and if you go outside,
even with an umbrella,

71
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,690
it can sometimes be hard to stay dry.

72
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,920
So the four levels of
rain in Ontario, Canada.

73
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,990
It's spitting, it's
drizzling, it's raining,

74
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,403
and then it's pouring.

75
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,970
Of course, as you know by now
with the English language,

76
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,940
we're never happy with just
one way to say something,

77
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,510
so when it's pouring outside,

78
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,820
there's a few ways we could describe that.

79
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,340
We could say, "It's a
real downpour out there."

80
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,220
A downpour is when it's
pouring rain outside.

81
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,060
Another way to say that
it's pouring in English.

82
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,340
You could say, "It's really
coming down out there."

83
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,550
That's probably the most
common one that I would use.

84
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,957
If it was pouring rain outside,
I would probably say to Jen,

85
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:21,150
"Wow, it's really coming down out there,"

86
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,157
and if I was outside in it, I would say,

87
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,300
"It's really coming down out here."

88
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,390
The third phrase is the phrase
it's raining cats and dogs.

89
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,630
Sorry, there's a mosquito
flying around me.

90
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,040
This phrase is quaint and
a little bit old fashioned.

91
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,770
I haven't actually heard anyone
use this phrase recently,

92
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,140
but you might, if you watch
an older movie or TV show,

93
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,780
hear someone describe a really hard rain

94
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,200
by saying, "It's raining
cats and dogs out there,"

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,030
or, "Wow, it's really
raining cats and dogs."

96
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,390
And then the last phrase that I might use,

97
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,410
I might say, "Wow, the sky has opened up,"

98
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,060
kind of a descriptive way to describe

99
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,640
that there were really beautiful clouds,

100
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,300
and it's like the sky opened up

101
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,140
and water just started falling down.

102
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,300
So four ways that you can
describe rain in English.

103
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,000
You could say, you could
use the word downpour.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,460
You could say, "It's really
coming down out there."

105
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,220
You could say, "It's
raining cats and dogs,"

106
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,209
if you want to sound old and quaint,

107
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,726
or you can say, "The sky has opened up."

108
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,969
Sometimes we have a day where it rains

109
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,710
and then it stops raining and
then it starts raining again,

110
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,190
and there's a couple of ways in English

111
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,590
that you can describe this.

112
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,060
You could say it's raining on and off.

113
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,450
You could say, "It's going
to rain on and off today,"

114
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,870
but you can also say, "It's
going to rain off and on."

115
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,890
You can switch the on and
off and use them both ways,

116
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,970
and it basically means that
it's gonna rain for a little bit

117
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,300
and then it's going to stop raining,

118
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,980
and then it's going to start again.

119
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,910
I think the official term for this,

120
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,100
if you look at the weather forecast,

121
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,630
is it would probably
say scattered showers.

122
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,520
It would say, "There's going
to be scattered showers today,"

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,160
and that simply means the same thing.

124
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,540
It means that it's going to rain,

125
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,600
and then it's going to stop,

126
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,690
and then it's going to rain again.

127
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,290
Sometimes it rains for most of the day,

128
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,000
and then eventually the rain stops,

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,030
and one phrase we use to describe that

130
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,660
is we say that the rain let up.

131
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,810
So we use the phrasal verb to let up

132
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,500
to describe the fact that
the rain is stopping.

133
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,333
So you could say,

134
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,680
"I think the rain is going
to let up later today,"

135
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,300
or, "I hope the rain lets up later today,

136
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,320
because I certainly hope it doesn't rain

137
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,050
when I have to play my
football game outside."

138
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,280
One more phrase before I wrap this up.

139
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,820
I'm happy that, as I finish
this lesson, I'm not soaked.

140
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,010
In English, when you say, "I'm soaked,"

141
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,210
it's something you might say

142
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,490
after you go outside in a rainstorm

143
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,750
and your clothes are all wet.

144
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,070
Thankfully, my jacket worked really well.

145
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,990
I have a little bit of rain
on me, but I'm not soaked.

146
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,190
So anyways, thanks again for
watching this English lesson

147
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,460
where I hope you learned a
few more phrases and words

148
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,230
to be able to talk about a rainy day.

149
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,130
