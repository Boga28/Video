in total.

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,239
I want to know how many you know out of 15?

17
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,960
Let me know in the comments, and let me

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,680
know which ones were new to you.

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,040
Okay, let's get down to business.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,520
Phrase number 1, 'touch base,' 'touch base.'

21
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,160
'To touch base' means to make contact with

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,120
someone, usually to share updates or information.

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,480
We usually say 'base' with a bit more

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,520
energy, 'touch base.'

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,400
You might also hear people say 'check in'

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,680
or 'catch up,' which have similar meanings.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,120
For example—'Let's touch base next week

28
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,360
to discuss the progress of 
the marketing campaign.'

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,720
Moving on to phrase 2, 'get the ball rolling'.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,920
'Get the ball rolling'.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,440
When you 'get the ball rolling', you start

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,800
or initiate something, like 
a project or a meeting.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
This phrase comes from the idea of

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,960
pushing a ball to start it moving.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,880
Another similar phrase is 'kick off'.

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,840
An example for 'get the ball rolling'—'I've
scheduled a team meeting for Monday to

37
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,000
get the ball rolling on the new product launch'.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,039
Next up, phrase 3, 'on the same page,'

39
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,840
'on the same page.'

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,000
Being 'on the same page' means that

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,400
everyone agrees and understands a
situation in the same way.

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,240
'Before we move forward, we need to get on
the same page and figure out the next steps.'

43
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,320
Phrase 4, this is a good one.

44
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,080
'In the loop,' 'in the loop.'

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,520
Informed about what is going on.

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,600
We normally stress the word 'loop,' 'in the loop.'

47
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,920
The opposite phrase is 'out of the loop,'
meaning someone isn't fully informed.

48
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,760
An example—'I'll send a weekly update
email to keep all stakeholders in the loop.'

49
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,360
Or—'I've been feeling a bit out of the
loop ever since I got back from maternity leave.'

50
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,760
And number 5, we have 'win-win.'

51
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,840
'Win-win.'

52
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,040
Business professionals love to use this phrase!

53
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,800
'A win-win situation' is one that benefits

54
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,240
everyone involved.

55
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,920
We say both syllables clearly, but the

56
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,280
main stress is on the second 'win.'

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,920
'Win-win.'

58
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,800
'Win-win.'

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,920
An example—'If we collaborate with their

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,280
team, it could be a win-win for both companies.'

61
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,640
Now, you get a bonus point if you can

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,680
come up with the opposite of 'win-win.'

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,200
No trick questions here.

64
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,640
We do say a 'lose-lose,' I promise.

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,240
Phrase 6 is 'think out of the box.'

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,560
'Think out of the box,' or 
'think outside of the box.'

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,200
'To think out of the box' is to think
creatively and innovatively, coming up

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,680
with entirely new solutions.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,720
If someone tells you 'to think out of the

70
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,880
box,' they are basically saying—think creatively.

71
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,560
You will also hear people shorten 'out of

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,200
the' to /ˈaʊtə ðə/ or /ˈaʊt̬ə ðə/.

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,840
That's in fast speech.

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,960
As I mentioned, we also say 'think outside
the box' or 'think outside of the box.'

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,040
They're both very common, just choose the
one you like best.

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,440
An example—'We really need to think
outside the box if we're going to beat

77
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,200
our competitors on this.'

78
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,600
Lucky number 7 is 'bottom line.'

79
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,720
'Bottom line.'

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,280
'The bottom line' has two main meanings in

81
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
business contexts.

82
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,000
First, it refers to the essential point

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,960
or final outcome.

84
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,800
It's the most important part of the

85
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,440
matter, the deciding factor.

86
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,520
This could be meeting a deadline,

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,440
satisfying customer needs, or achieving a
specific goal.

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,520
For example—'The bottom line is that we
need to ensure customer satisfaction

89
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,920
above all else.'

90
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,440
In addition to this more general meaning,

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,960
'the bottom line' also has a specific
financial definition.

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,280
In a business English setting, your
'bottom line' can refer to the final

93
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,280
financial outcome, whether it's a profit
or a loss, after all expenses and

94
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,840
revenues have been accounted for.

95
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,200
An example—'Our bottom line has improved

96
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,280
since implementing the new cost-saving measures.'

97
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,520
For phrase 8, we have 'action point.'

98
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,320
'Action point.'

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,800
'An action point' is a task that needs to

100
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
be completed, usually assigned during a meeting.

101
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Stress 'action.'

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,920
You might also hear 'action item,' which
has the same meaning.

103
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,800
An example—'Let's review the action
points from last week's meeting.'

104
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,360
Phrase 9, 'learning curve.'

105
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,360
'Learning curve.'

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,480
'The learning curve' is the time it takes
to learn a new skill or understand a new process.

107
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:57,080
We often use the strong collocation—
'steep learning curve' to talk about

108
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,120
something that's quite difficult to learn.

109
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,640
For example—'We went through a steep

110
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,840
learning curve when switching to the new
software but it was worth it in the end.'

111
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,360
Number 10, 'game plan.'

112
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,960
'Game plan.'

113
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,280
Notice how there's no pause between the
two words and I blend the 'm' and 'p' together.

114
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,360
'Game plan.'

115
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,200
'A game plan' is a strategy or plan for

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
achieving a goal.

117
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,280
And this phrase likely comes from sports

118
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,560
where teams have a strategic plan for winning.

119
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,680
For example—'Let's develop a game plan

120
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,560
for expanding into international markets.'

121
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,240
Phrase 11, 'to give the green light.'

122
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,200
'To give the green light.'

123
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,600
When someone 'gives the green light,' they

124
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
approve or give permission for something
to happen.

125
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:51,040
The emphasis is on 'green light,' which
comes from traffic signals where green

126
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,080
means go.

127
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,080
You might also hear the verb 'to green-light

128
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,200
something,' which has a similar meaning.

129
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,520
An example—'Once the budget is approved,

130
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,040
we'll give the green light to start the project.'

131
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,200
At 12, we have 'at stake,' 'at stake.'

132
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,880
If something is 'at stake,' it means it's
at risk or there's something to be lost

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,760
or gained, and it often implies high
importance or urgency.

134
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,480
For example—'There's a lot at stake with
this big client pitch, so let's bring our

135
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
A-game!'

136
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,680
'A-game' is another great expression,

137
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,200
meaning giving your best performance or effort.

138
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,720
Moving on to 13, 'pain point,' 'pain point.'

139
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,680
'A pain point' is a problem or challenge
that a customer or business is facing,

140
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,840
but the emphasis is on pain.

141
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,400
Identifying 'pain points' helps businesses

142
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,520
create solutions that customers need.

143
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,800
For example—'Our new service addresses a

144
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,040
major pain point for small business owners.'

145
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,840
Our penultimate phrase—phrase 14—is 'up

146
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,800
to speed,' 'up to speed.'

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,040
When you're 'up to speed,' it means you

148
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,680
have the latest information and are fully
informed about a particular topic or situation.

149
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,360
We often use this phrase with 'on' to
specify the subject.

150
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,200
For example—'I need to get up to speed on
the new project guidelines.'

151
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,440
Once you're comfortable with this usage,
you'll also often hear it combined with

152
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,680
verbs like 'get' or 'be.'

153
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,360
For example—'Let's schedule a call to get

154
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,159
the new team members up to speed on the project.'

155
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,479
And finally, our last one, number 15, we

156
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,240
have 'ballpark figure.'

157
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,400
'Ballpark figure.'

158
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,800
I remember being so confused when I heard
this for the first time.

159
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,720
'A ballpark figure' is a rough estimate,
not an exact number.

160
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,480
'Ballpark' likely comes from baseball
stadiums, implying a large general area.

161
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,240
For example—'Can you give me a ballpark
figure for the cost of the event?'

162
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:11,440
And there you have it: 15 essential, quite
advanced business English phrases to help

you sound professional. How many did you

like a seasoned pro in no time.

166
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,720
Also, this is the first time I'm

167
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,560
mentioning it on this channel, but in the
next few months, I will release my new

168
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,600
Professional English Programme, Level 2.

169
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
This caters to the B2 level of English in

170
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,080
