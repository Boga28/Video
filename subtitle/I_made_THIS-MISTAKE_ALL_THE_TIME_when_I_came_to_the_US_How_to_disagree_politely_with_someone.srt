00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,159
hey guys welcome to lingua marina today

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,120
we're gonna talk

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,759
about disagreeing with people and i know

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,120
these situations

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,519
happen very often and when i first came

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,559
to the us

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
i used my russian russian culture where

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,719
we disagree with people like say

9
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,480
no you're wrong like we're very

10
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,920
straightforward people

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,400
in russia in america it doesn't work

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,080
that way it can be actually

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,720
really offensive if you just say no

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,599
you're wrong

15
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,320
i think it's this this and that so when

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,960
i was

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
studying here and i went through a

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,159
filmmaking course

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,559
when i was just dealing with people they

20
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,360
would kind of

21
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,000
correct me sometimes say marina that's

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,600
not the right way to disagree with

23
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,800
people you should do this

24
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,960
this and that so i decided that in this

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,079
video i'm gonna

26
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,920
collect all of my experience i'm gonna

27
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,000
share some tips and tricks that you can

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,680
use to disagree with people

29
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,960
without becoming too angry without

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
starting a fight so if you're interested

31
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,399
in

32
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,320
both learning some new vocabulary and

33
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,520
also learning some

34
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,399
cultural aspects of living in the us and

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
most of the western world i guess

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,840
please continue watching this video

37
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
first of all when you disagree with

38
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,240
people please

39
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,720
start with facts when you disagree with

40
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,439
someone

41
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,200
it's not like a personal thing it's not

42
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,960
just that you want to show a person that

43
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,799
you disagree with everything they do

44
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,560
well sometimes we have those situations

45
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,479
we're not going to talk about them

46
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,840
but disagree with facts like for example

47
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,000
if somebody tells you it's going to rain

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,960
in an hour

49
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,400
you'll be like i actually just checked

50
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
my app and it's not going to rain

51
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,200
what does your app say so you know talk

52
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,640
about facts don't say oh

53
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,600
no you're wrong you are stupid you

54
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,119
haven't considered this this and that

55
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,000
having even looked

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,119
at your phone this is too much also when

57
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,040
you talk about facts it just makes you

58
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
more convincing

59
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,280
because when you're talking facts you

60
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,600
actually have a ground to disagree

61
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
when you're talking just based on your

62
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,799
emotions and what you think about

63
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,159
another person

64
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,880
that doesn't really support your opinion

65
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,680
the second

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,719
tip here is to just be indirect

67
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,600
and being indirect is a thing that can

68
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,439
confuse you when you come to the us

69
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,119
because a lot of americans are very

70
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,479
indirect with everything

71
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,560
if they disagree with you or they don't

72
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
like something

73
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,760
they can start their phrase by wow

74
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,520
you're amazing and i really like your

75
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
work and you're like

76
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,200
and then it's going to be followed up by

77
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,360
but unfortunately we think

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,080
that this it doesn't meet our investment

79
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,120
criteria or whatever

80
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
when i was fundraising for a lingua trip

81
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,040
with my husband all of the replies from

82
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,720
investors and we had like

83
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,200
over 50 meetings i guess we had more but

84
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
all of the replies would start with

85
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,640
you guys are doing an amazing job your

86
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,920
company is great

87
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,720
but and then they would say that they

88
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,239
basically don't want to invest

89
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
so and that was super confusing because

90
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,840
at first you think like if the people

91
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
think that your company is great

92
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,360
why don't they invest so this is the way

93
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,280
of how americans are

94
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,360
indirect with their feedback they would

95
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,760
always start with something positive

96
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
and then disagree or say something

97
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,159
negative and even the the negative thing

98
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,360
that they're saying it wouldn't

99
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,519
sound too negative it would sound like

100
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,959
if it's their fault

101
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,040
not your fault that they're not

102
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,120
investing or they don't want to hire you

103
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,400
or they don't want to accept you to the

104
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,159
university or whatever

105
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,400
and so what you've noticed here from my

106
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,840
from my story it's like

107
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,599
always going from you to me

108
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,120
so i would never say oh my god your idea

109
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,080
is horrible

110
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,840
i would say if i want to sound polite

111
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,680
and indirect i would say

112
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,080
i don't really think that this idea

113
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,720
would work

114
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,640
i don't think that would be a good idea

115
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,080
you see how i am

116
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,599
trying to be polite i'm not saying it's

117
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,319
a horrible idea and also i am trying to

118
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,560
take away somebody else's pain or

119
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,159
somebody else's fault to me

120
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,319
i just don't think it's a good idea

121
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,200
instead of saying

122
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,280
it's a horrible idea or instead of

123
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
saying you're wrong you're stupid

124
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,720
i would say i am not sure i can't agree

125
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,959
gotta say i'm not too sure i agree with

126
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
that so you see how i'm always talking

127
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,720
to another person through

128
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,439
myself i'm not sure i can agree with

129
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,080
this

130
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,400
i'm not sure this idea is gonna work i

131
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
don't think it's the right thing to do

132
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
so it's always about me

133
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
not about another person here's another

134
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,480
thing don't be

135
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,519
overpolite as well like don't overdo and

136
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,440
i think you could overdo

137
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,358
being polite by saying sorry because i

138
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,560
think a lot of

139
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,800
americans and a lot of native speakers

140
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,759
use sorry

141
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,240
way too often even if you know that the

142
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,520
most common situation

143
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
is when you're running and it's a rush

144
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,680
hour and somebody bumps into you and you

145
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,080
say

146
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,040
i'm sorry like it's it's even not your

147
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
fault you were just there and

148
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,639
the person another person didn't notice

149
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,080
you i would avoid saying

150
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,759
sorry just because you have a different

151
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
opinion but again it's up to you

152
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,600
quick pause here disagreeing with

153
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,960
someone directly

154
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,199
is one of the most common mistakes

155
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,400
people make in english

156
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
and i made it many many times and people

157
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,520
were like

158
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,160
eh because there are some grammar

159
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,280
mistakes that you make

160
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
there are vocabulary mistakes that you

161
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,880
make and there are cultural mistakes

162
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,880
well i wouldn't call them mistakes

163
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,360
necessarily but you need to understand

164
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,280
a culture before you can actually speak

165
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,639
like a native speaker

166
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,520
so if you struggle with making mistakes

167
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,440
my team at linguatrip and i have created

168
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,560
a workbook

169
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,720
that actually goes through 365 mistakes

170
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,520
that are very very common for non-native

171
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,560
speakers in english

172
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
just imagine you get this workbook and

173
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,759
every single day

174
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,320
you learn how to not make another

175
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,160
mistake an example of a mistake

176
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,400
when i came to the us i said i and

177
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,720
dimitri my husband we started a company

178
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,160
which is completely wrong

179
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
dmitri and i have started a company

180
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,680
because when you're talking about

181
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,039
yourself and somebody else

182
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,919
somebody else goes on the first place in

183
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:44,960
the sentence

184
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,039
those kinds of mistakes are in that

185
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,080
workbook with

186
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,639
real examples with very intuitive

187
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,520
explanations

188
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,039
and we have a special prize for you

189
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,800
today the link will be down below

better every single day by tackling

193
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,199
one of the mistakes that a lot of

194
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,039
non-native speakers make in english

195
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,880
the link will be down below now let's

196
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,479
get back to the class and learn some

197
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,199
phrases

198
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,520
that would help you disagree with a

199
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
person in a polite way

200
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,680
are you sure that's possible and also

201
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,199
please pay attention to

202
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,720
the way you pronounce this phrase

203
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,400
because i say are you sure that's

204
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
possible

205
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,000
it's kind of you're being sarcastic when

206
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,400
you're

207
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,039
genuinely wondering are you sure that's

208
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,240
possible

209
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,240
it sounds a lot more polite the same

210
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,440
with

211
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,639
i wonder if it's true like again once

212
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,240
you play with your intonation there is a

213
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,520
completely different meaning to the

214
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,000
phrase

215
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,880
it sounds a lot better when you say i

216
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
wonder if that's true

217
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,360
let's check really i wonder if it works

218
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,919
like that

219
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,680
i wonder if it still works this way

220
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,120
interesting really

221
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,560
really interesting this word interesting

222
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,400
we keep laughing at it with our friends

223
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,919
because whenever whenever

224
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,560
we use it like i tried something i think

225
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
it was food at restaurant

226
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,440
and i hated it and i was like because i

227
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,960
wanted to be polite i said

228
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,039
that's an interesting flavor and

229
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,960
everybody started laughing because they

230
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,440
know

231
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,120
what i mean under interesting i mean

232
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,720
horrible when you say like

233
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,560
for example you see this course online

234
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,840
that tells you

235
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,319
you're gonna become rich in three days

236
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,240
after taking this course i'm gonna teach

237
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,160
you how to buy a lambo in a month

238
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
and you're like interesting really and

239
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:23,919
um

240
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,240
with this interesting you just say that

241
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,680
you know i don't believe that's gonna

242
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,160
work

243
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,080
but again watch your intonation don't be

244
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,000
too skeptical maybe that's the real

245
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,680
course where you get rich in in three

246
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,639
days or whatever

247
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
another way to disagree indirectly is

248
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
just to state your opinion and when you

249
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,479
start your phrase with well

250
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,199
or actually these words would indicate

251
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,000
that you're actually

252
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,759
disagreeing so people will get you

253
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,919
disagreeing without you actually saying

254
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,520
that you're disagreeing if you know what

255
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:49,919
i mean

256
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,599
let me give you an example let's not

257
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,199
invite friends and go to a restaurant

258
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,240
tonight instead

259
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,160
actually i think we'll have a better

260
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,599
time with our friends

261
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,160
you know this actually i think we should

262
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
invite them

263
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
that just indicates that you disagree

264
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,039
let's look at another example

265
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,720
titanic is the best movie of all time

266
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,360
well in my opinion citizen kane is

267
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,479
better

268
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,599
by the way watch citizen kane one of the

269
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,919
best movies i watch is classic

270
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
and everyone well a lot of people in

271
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,039
america i know

272
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
watched it and when you learn a language

273
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,960
it's important to know the context

274
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,720
so when you're speaking to a native

275
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,080
speaker and they've mentioned citizen

276
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
kane you're like oh yeah marina told me

277
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,360
to watch it and i watched it

278
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,679
and now i can support the conversation

279
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,200
so always always

280
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,640
try to watch movies that people are

281
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
talking about try to follow

282
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,320
different people try to learn what's

283
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,919
going on in the world so not only you

284
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,360
can sound good at english but also you

285
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,200
can support conversations i found it

286
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,399
really really important

287
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,040
because um okay quick quick story when i

288
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
first came to the uk

289
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
my friends were discussing all of the

290
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
stories like there was a rabid story

291
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,320
that everyone read when they were a kid

292
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,839
and i didn't read it because i grew up

293
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,040
in russia and we had completely

294
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,320
different fairy tales

295
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
and i'm just teaching emily my daughter

296
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
all of the local

297
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,200
stories and all of the local fairy tales

298
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,120
because i want her to be in context

299
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
when she goes to kindergarten when she

300
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,959
goes to school i want her to know

301
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,279
what other kids were reading when they

302
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,880
just lived with their families

303
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,399
so it's really important to be in the

304
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,640
context and this is why i highly highly

305
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,160
highly recommend watching

306
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,760
citizen kane when we go back to the

307
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,839
example when i say well

308
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,680
i actually think citizen keen is better

309
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,880
so this well

310
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
indicates that i'm disagreeing you can

311
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
also acknowledge another person's

312
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,279
opinion

313
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,760
before actually stating your opinion

314
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,760
because it would just help other people

315
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,360
understand that you're listening to them

316
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
not just disagreeing and there are some

317
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
phrases that you can use for that as

318
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,800
well

319
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,920
i see what you're saying but and then

320
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,959
you continue

321
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,440
i see what you're saying i understand

322
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,800
where you're coming from

323
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,640
but i understand where you're coming

324
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,000
from that's a

325
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,680
valid point but that is a valid point

326
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,160
and after this but you can introduce

327
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,519
your opinion

328
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,959
there is some truth to what you're

329
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,880
saying but don't you

330
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,760
think that if you ask me i think we

331
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,399
should

332
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,360
and then you suggest instead i think we

333
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,920
should

334
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,480
could god all together invite our

335
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,360
friends

336
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,959
my suggestion would be to do something

337
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,279
my suggestion would be an alternative

338
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,880
solution might be

339
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,120
i would recommend that we what do you

340
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,079
think about

341
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,640
having lunch outside instead another

342
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,440
helpful tip

343
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,920
is to find common ground which means

344
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,880
that you pick

345
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
some things that you actually agree with

346
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,560
in another person's statement

347
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,720
and then you add something else while i

348
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,600
agree with you

349
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,320
on and then you state the common ground

350
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,000
have you considered

351
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,720
blah blah blah an example would be well

352
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,800
i agree with you on the point that we

353
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,399
have to change your strategy

354
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,720
have you considered a less aggressive

355
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
approach

356
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
now there are some phrases that are a

357
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
little more direct and they're a little

358
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,760
more

359
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
like when you have to cut it because

360
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,360
sometimes you get to a point

361
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,600
where you don't want to be too polite

362
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
let's learn those phrases as well you

363
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,079
have to know them

364
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,399
i'm afraid i disagree i'm afraid i have

365
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,200
to disagree

366
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,360
i'm afraid i have to say no i'm not sure

367
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,160
about that i'm not so sure about that

368
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,560
not necessarily necessarily again those

369
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,160
phrases can be said with such an

370
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,880
intonation

371
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,200
and such context that they don't sound

372
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,920
impolite

373
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,839
i don't see it that way i didn't see it

374
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:22,959
that way or

375
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,480
you can simply say yes but yes

376
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,720
but let's wrap up this video with some

377
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,720
informal phrases that you can use to

378
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,519
