1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
- A long time ago, but not long enough ago

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,292
that it's not still very relevant

3
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:06,770
(audience laughs)

4
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,750
everyone in Britain got in a big old boat,

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,540
and we set sail and we robbed,

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,080
and this will sound far-fetched,

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,582
everyone in the world.

8
00:00:13,582 --> 00:00:14,636
(audience laughs)

9
00:00:14,636 --> 00:00:15,469
Do you remember that?

10
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:16,302
What a spree that was?

11
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:17,135
Do you remember the great heist?

12
00:00:17,135 --> 00:00:18,371
What a spree.

13
00:00:18,371 --> 00:00:21,220
(audience laughs)

14
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,277
And we got all this swag didn't we?

15
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:24,130
And we took it back to old blighty

16
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,840
and we hid it, this is the clever part,

17
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,331
we hid it in a museum.

18
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:31,164
(audience laughs)

19
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,183
Last place anyone looks.

20
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,140
Now it's the modern day,

21
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,290
and all them countries we stole stuff from

22
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,370
are asking for their stuff back.

23
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,930
But don't be worried.

24
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,291
We're totally saying a blanket no.

25
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,124
(audience laughs)

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:50,460
Now, a few of you are sitting there,

27
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,660
I can see your angry faces,

28
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,342
like "So what? Finders keepers, shut up."

29
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:57,443
And--
(audience laughs)

30
00:00:57,443 --> 00:01:00,050
listen, in your defense,
"finders keepers, shut up"

31
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:02,818
has worked very well for us so far.

32
00:01:02,818 --> 00:01:04,247
Gents does and knocked it out of the park

33
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:05,627
"finders keepers, shut up".

34
00:01:08,713 --> 00:01:10,040
But even you got to admit, right,

35
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,290
if someone stole something
off you as an individual,

36
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,740
it was your favorite
thing and they nicked it,

37
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,500
and you knew who had nicked it by the way

38
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,720
for a fact, not a hunch,
you know who's stolen it.

39
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,640
Everybody knows, it's common knowledge.

40
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,100
Some people have written books about it.

41
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,699
They have definitely nicked it off you.

42
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:26,357
(audience laughs)

43
00:01:26,357 --> 00:01:28,360
You go to ask for it back,
and they just standing there.

44
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,535
They're not even running away.

45
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:30,770
And they're twice your
size, they ain't scared.

46
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,150
They haven't even bothered to hide it.

47
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,800
They've done the opposite
of hiding it actually.

48
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,824
They put it in a glass display case.

49
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:36,990
(audience laughs)

50
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,810
It's lit from seven different
angles, real clear what it is.

51
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,010
There's no disputing it's the same thing

52
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,010
that once belonged to you cause
there's a plaque next to it,

53
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,750
says exactly what it is
at the top of the plaque,

54
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,020
and then a paragraph underneath

55
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,506
about how important it is
to you and your culture.

56
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:53,339
(audience laughs)

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,497
You'd be forgiven for
thinking, "Mmm I'm pretty sure

58
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,260
"they haven't got a leg to stand on here.

59
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,107
(audience laughs)

60
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:02,560
"Probably gonna take this home today."

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,170
Must have been so confident,
all them countries

62
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,590
when they asked for their stuffs back.

63
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,197
Walking up to Britain,
saying to their friends,

64
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:09,846
"Wait in the car, don't even need ya.

65
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:11,273
"Be back in a jiffy mate.

66
00:02:14,047 --> 00:02:16,817
"Hey man, a while ago,
a lot of your ancestors

67
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:18,547
"stole loads of stuff from my ancestors.

68
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,487
"Yeah, I'm here to take them home.

69
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,505
"Let's right this wrong, what do you say?"

70
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,700
They must have thought the
British person at the door

71
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,177
was gonna go, "Absolutely
you can have them back.

72
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:30,967
"We stole them after all."

73
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:36,547
But instead we went, "I don't think so.

74
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:37,777
(audience laughs)

75
00:02:37,777 --> 00:02:39,532
"We're still looking at it.

76
00:02:39,532 --> 00:02:43,282
(audience laughs and cheers)

77
00:02:48,987 --> 00:02:51,177
"Yeah, just looking at it these days.

78
00:02:51,177 --> 00:02:52,877
"And there's a lot of other
people who haven't seen it yet

79
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:54,237
"we'd quite like to show it to.

80
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:56,792
"So not right now selfish.

81
00:02:56,792 --> 00:03:00,007
(audience laughs)

82
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:00,840
"Don't sulk about it.

83
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,047
"Look, it's no hard feelings mate.

84
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:03,577
"Hey, you can look at it, come on in.

85
00:03:03,577 --> 00:03:04,967
"Have a look; have a look.

86
00:03:04,967 --> 00:03:06,045
"Seem familiar?

87
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:08,857
(evil chortle)

88
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:10,663
"Stand behind the rope!"

89
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:13,714
(audience laughs)

90
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,600
That's why the British Museum
is so busy all the time.

91
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,940
No British people ever go in there,

92
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,101
it's full of people from abroad
looking at their own stuff.

93
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:21,200
(audience laughs)

94
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,310
Just walking the corridors,

95
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,080
reminiscing about the good old days.

96
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,710
And I imagine just openly
robbing the gift shop at the end.

97
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,113
That is one all you punks.
