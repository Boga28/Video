1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:04,502
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:11,187
- Hello everyone.

3
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:13,540
And welcome back to English with Lucy.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,830
I'm here once again in front

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,580
of possibly the most
beautiful tree in England.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,730
I don't know, no offence to other trees.

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,140
Now, today we are going to
be talking about small talk

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,800
because I don't want to jinx it,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,390
but it seems that the world is,

10
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,440
or some places in the world
are slowly opening up again.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,440
Here in the UK, supposedly
we have Freedom Day

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:42,740
on the 19th of July where nightclubs,

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,880
bars and everything open up again,

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,550
and people have the choice
to not wear masks anymore.

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,810
Let me know what the situation
is like in your country

16
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,860
in the comments section down below.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,830
And when I heard about this
Freedom Day from the pandemic,

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,630
I suddenly thought, oh, my word,

19
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:04,099
I have not been in a big room of people

20
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:09,100
having to make conversation
in a year and a half.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,860
So I thought today we
could talk about small talk

22
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,580
and I'm actually going
to give you 50 different

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,690
small talk questions that you can use

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,460
in your next social event,

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,520
because not only are you learning English

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,040
you are also probably a
little bit out of practise.

27
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,700
There's nothing worse than
trying to make conversation

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,950
in another language and
just having loads of boring,

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,000
embarrassing silences.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,690
So all of these questions
or nearly all of them

31
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,040
are open-ended.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,800
So you can get really good
answers from the other person.

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,700
As always I have created a free PDF

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,270
that goes with this video if
you'd like to download it,

35
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,970
all you've got to do is click on the link

36
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,890
in the description box,

37
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,420
you enter your name
and your email address,

38
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,540
you sign up to my mailing
list and then I send the PDF

39
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,180
directly to your inbox,
and then every week

40
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,780
after that you will automatically
receive my free PDFs.

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,300
Plus all of my news offers
and course information.

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,169
Before we get started,
I would like to Thank

43
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:11,960
the sponsor of today's video, Skillshare,

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,120
which is an online learning community

45
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,640
with thousands of inspiring classes,

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,020
for creative and curious people.

47
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,710
There are so many classes to choose from.

48
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,860
From writing to design, to animation,

49
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,440
to business, to productivity.

50
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,130
I recently took a class,

51
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,940
could email productivity work smarter

52
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,130
with your inbox by Alexandra Samuel,

53
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,900
and it transformed my email game.

54
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,860
Emails used to stress me out so much,

55
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,760
and this 45 minute class
just taught me to filter

56
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,700
through everything and
organise my email game.

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,540
Skillshare is curated
specifically for learning.

58
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,580
Meaning there are no ads and
they are always launching

59
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,760
new premium classes so
you can stay focused

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,530
and follow wherever your
creativity takes you.

61
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,100
The first 1000 of my
subscribers to click on the link

62
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,500
in the description box will
get a one a month free trial

63
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,910
of Skillshare premium

64
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,930
so you can start
exploring your creativity.

65
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,763
Right.

66
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:12,933
Let's get started with the small talk.

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,130
I have divided the 50 small talk questions

68
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,450
into five different categories.

69
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,400
The first one being travel,

70
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,650
which is something that
most of us haven't been able

71
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,490
to do a lot of recently.

72
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,560
But hopefully things are
getting back to normal

73
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,240
and we will be able to attend conferences

74
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,850
and make small talk with
people we don't know.

75
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,683
Yes.

76
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,620
The first question, a really good one

77
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,950
if you're in a new country and
you're speaking to a local,

78
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,550
do you know of any
hidden gems around here?

79
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,270
A hidden gem is something
really, really great,

80
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,870
a really great place or restaurant,

81
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,540
that tourists don't generally know about.

82
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,970
In fact, not many people know about it.

83
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,740
You kinda have to hear
about it to go there.

84
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,380
When I travel I always ask
around for the hidden gems.

85
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,550
You could also put it
in more simple terms.

86
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,550
Is there anything I should
know about around here?

87
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,200
Are there any places I should know about?

88
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,480
Now generally when it comes to small talk,

89
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,020
it's really good to ask open questions.

90
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,190
Questions that can't be
answered with a yes or no,

91
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,750
because if the answer with
no and it really shuts

92
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,140
down the conversation,

93
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,730
but I think this next one is an exception.

94
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,920
Have you got any trips planned?

95
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,020
If they say, no, you can
move on to another topic

96
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,680
of small talk.

97
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,430
If you know the person you're talking to,

98
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,240
and you know, they went
on a trip recently,

99
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,547
you can say, "Tell me
about your trip to Hawaii.

100
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:36,570
"Would you recommend it?"

101
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,240
If there's one thing I've learned,

102
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,380
people love talking about
their past holidays.

103
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,060
Another great topic to bring
up is food whilst travelling.

104
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,370
You could say something like
I love trying new cuisines.

105
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,480
Have you been anywhere
with really great food?

106
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,760
If you're with a fellow foodie,

107
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,470
then you know conversation
is going to flow.

108
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,560
The next one is a great one
for international conferences

109
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,620
where you know that the majority of people

110
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,290
have come in from another location.

111
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,620
One question I like to
ask in those situations

112
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:11,073
is have you got any tips for jetlag?

113
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,840
I really, really struggle with it.

114
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,130
So if you do have any tips

115
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,150
please do put them in the comment section.

116
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,930
Now what about if you are in your hometown

117
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,080
but someone else has come in to visit.

118
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,100
You could say let me know if
you need any recommendations.

119
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,040
I know this area pretty well.

120
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,230
That's a great opportunity
for them to follow up with.

121
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,220
Yeah, actually I'm looking for
somewhere for dinner tonight,

122
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,320
do you know anywhere?

123
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,320
And then you panic because
you've lived here for 10 years

124
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,670
and you've hardly gone out.

125
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,580
That was like me in London as a student,

126
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,100
I lived there for three years

127
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,380
but because I never had any money

128
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,690
I never went to any restaurants.

129
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,523
So when people ask me,

130
00:05:48,523 --> 00:05:50,397
"Where should I go in London?"

131
00:05:50,397 --> 00:05:52,010
"I have no idea."

132
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,690
I just ate microwave meals.

133
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,530
Another great question is
asking what sort of holiday

134
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,410
or trip someone prefers.

135
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,930
You could say, do you prefer
a fly-and-flop holiday

136
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,190
or an adventure?

137
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,270
A fly-and-flop holiday is
what it says on the tin,

138
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,320
you fly out to the destination,

139
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,330
you flop on a sunbed and
you remain there for one

140
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,173
to two weeks and then you fly home.

141
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,090
Another interesting question
to do with the pandemic is,

142
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,910
has the pandemic affected
your travel plans at all?

143
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,620
And this will probably
open up a lot of moaning

144
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,980
from the other person.

145
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,053
It would, for me, the
pandemic ruined a honeymoon.

146
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,400
And the last one number 10 is
so when are you heading back?

147
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,180
What do you want to do before you go back?

148
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,640
Right, let's move on to the topic of work.

149
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,380
Maybe you're trying to get
to know your new colleagues

150
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,850
or your existing colleagues
that you've hardly met before.

151
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,100
It's really nice to have a
couple of small talk questions

152
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,230
up your sleeve to combat
those awkward silences.

153
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,150
The first one.

154
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,990
So how did you get into marketing?

155
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,320
How did you get into sales?

156
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,870
So really nice general one.

157
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,150
And it invites the person to tell

158
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,550
you a little bit about their work history.

159
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,700
Two really interesting ones
are what is the best career

160
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,330
advice you've ever received?

161
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,330
And then the next one,

162
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,910
what's the worst career
advice you've ever received.

163
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,950
I use this one a lot

164
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,840
and I get some really interesting answers,

165
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,890
especially for the worst career advice.

166
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,360
The next one, a nice theoretical one,

167
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,250
if you were guaranteed to be successful,

168
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,500
what job would you want?

169
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,800
That's a really interesting one.

170
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,810
I don't even know how I would answer that.

171
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,200
You'll get your partner thinking there.

172
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,990
Another really fun one
is what is the craziest

173
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,640
thing a boss has ever asked you to do?

174
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,330
I think the craziest thing
a boss has ever made me do,

175
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,840
he didn't ask me,

176
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,760
is I had to knock on
his door in the middle

177
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,780
of the night to beg for him to pay me.

178
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,903
It was two months late
and I needed my money.

179
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,020
This next one is a nice
way of making someone

180
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,550
feel part of your conversation.

181
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,890
You could say, I was just
talking to a colleague

182
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,480
about our first jobs, what was yours?

183
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,743
Everyone who is currently
working has a first job.

184
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,870
A really good and easy one is how long

185
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,050
have you been working at company?

186
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,313
How long have you been
working at Lucy International?

187
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,316
My whole life darling.

188
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,390
(laughs)

189
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,020
A topic that's in the
news quite a lot recently.

190
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,350
What do you think about
this four-day work week?

191
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,770
I've been seeing that coming
up a lot on my news apps

192
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,140
and I think it sounds
like a fantastic idea.

193
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,120
If people can still
maintain good productivity,

194
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,440
give the people an extra day off,

195
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,309
work to live, don't live to work.

196
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,280
Bring it back to the pandemic,

197
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,200
have you had to work from home recently?

198
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,910
How did you find working from home?

199
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,820
That's a really good topic
'cause that shook up the lives

200
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,120
of many people over here in the UK.

201
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,610
And I'm sure all across the world as well.

202
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,400
And the last one, have you
got any plans for the weekend?

203
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,010
I remember Friday and sometimes
even Thursday afternoon

204
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,620
when I did work in an
office all we could talk

205
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,290
about with the weekend and I loved it.

206
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,600
I used to count down those hours

207
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,280
until it was five o'clock
on a Friday evening.

208
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,250
Oh yes.

209
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,670
All right, next topic, current
events or current affairs.

210
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,440
Now, obviously people are going
to talk about the pandemic.

211
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,020
So one question you could
ask is has the pandemic

212
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,010
affected you much?

213
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,800
But remember that lots of people have lost

214
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,633
loved ones in this,

215
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:29,240
so they might not want
to focus too much on it.

216
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,360
Another one is this person
is from another country

217
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,480
you could say, how are you
all getting on back home?

218
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,140
This invites them to open
up about how the pandemic

219
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,760
has affected their country if
they want to talk about it.

220
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,420
Another variation is how has the pandemic

221
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,490
changed life for you?

222
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:48,610
Some really great conversation
starters are the next three.

223
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,940
I read in the paper that,
I saw on the news that,

224
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,530
or I heard on the radio that,

225
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,670
and then obviously you can
speak about what you've seen,

226
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,070
heard, or read recently.

227
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,940
If you know that your conversation
partner is a sports fun,

228
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,610
you could say, did you catch the game?

229
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,270
Even if you don't know which game it was,

230
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,030
hopefully just by saying the
game they'll know which game

231
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,010
you were talking about,

232
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,570
but make sure you have
a game up your sleeve

233
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,373
for if they say, what game.

234
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,480
If there has been an interesting
or negative situation

235
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,810
in another country, and
you've been following

236
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,650
it on the news,

237
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,280
you could ask something
like, have you been following

238
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,770
what's been going on in, for example.

239
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,660
Again, if the person is from another town

240
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,790
or city or country, you could say,

241
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,250
so what's the latest
news where you're from?

242
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,083
And the last one,

243
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,220
a really interesting
question that somebody

244
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,110
asked me the other day is which
news outlets do you prefer?

245
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,470
And then they asked why.

246
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,200
And this can invite the person
to share kind of indirectly

247
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,920
a little bit of their political leanings,

248
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,740
which is quite interesting.

249
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,573
Right.

250
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,080
The next topic is social events.

251
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,120
I haven't been to a big social event,

252
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,810
well, I've said it before
in a year and a half.

253
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,850
And I'm nervous.

254
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:03,930
I'm very, very nervous.

255
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,790
So I can't imagine how nerve
wracking it will be in a second

256
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,920
language or a foreign language.

257
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,880
So here are some questions
for you to have up your sleeve

258
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,930
to fill in those silences.

259
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,440
The first one, what brings you here?

260
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,500
What brings you here?

261
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,140
And that invites them to
say, oh, well I work with,

262
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:25,770
or I know or I'm going
out with, for example.

263
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,250
If you meet somebody and
you have a mutual friend,

264
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,650
you could ask, so how do you know, Tom?

265
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,260
For example.

266
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,180
I always find a compliment goes a long way

267
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,880
as long as it's a genuine one.

268
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,840
So you could say, wow,
your dress is so unique,

269
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,410
where did you get it from?

270
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,220
I'm in two minds about the next question.

271
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,590
Are you enjoying yourself?

272
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,580
Sometimes it can be a
little bit patronising.

273
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,730
So you've got to say it in the right tone.

274
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,580
But if somebody says,

275
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,960
no, that opens up a bonding opportunity.

276
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,660
If you're also not enjoying
yourself you can say,

277
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,490
oh, Thank God me neither.

278
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,703
I hate social occasions.

279
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,420
If you aren't enjoying a social situation,

280
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,460
you could say something like,

281
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,530
I really don't normally like
crowded events like these,

282
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,560
how about you?

283
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,260
And if the person says, I love them,

284
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,710
then you know, you might not be friends.

285
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,730
But if they say, God,
yes, I hate them too.

286
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,920
Friend for life instantaneous.

287
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,490
If you see somebody who is
hovering around on their own,

288
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,050
you could go up to them and say,

289
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,600
do you know many people here?

290
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,490
And if they say, no,
well then you can stand

291
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,570
and chat with them instead.

292
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:34,350
I absolutely love it when
I'm on my own at an event,

293
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,780
and somebody comes in to save me.

294
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,370
I really, really liked that.

295
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,620
Right.

296
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,630
More pandemic.

297
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,190
A really good way of bonding with someone

298
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,900
else is to kind of share
a bit of vulnerability.

299
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,230
And one thing you could say is,

300
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,680
hello, I've actually not
been around another human

301
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,850
in a whole year so I'm feeling
really awkward right now.

302
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,890
How are you feeling?

303
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,040
That's a good invitation
for you to bond over.

304
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,340
Just feeling out of practise

305
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,440
and not knowing how to behave
in social situations anymore.

306
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,110
Another one I'm desperate for everything

307
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,943
to get back to normal.

308
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,890
What have you missed most?

309
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,450
Or when is the last
time that you were able

310
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,370
to go to a proper party like this?

311
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,334
And you can both bond over
how much you've missed out on.

312
00:13:18,334 --> 00:13:22,760
And the last one I really
liked this one, it's very meta.

313
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,520
What is your best tip

314
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,630
for figuring out small talk these days?

315
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,010
I love it 'cause they can
instantly say something like,

316
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,290
just don't talk about the weather.

317
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:34,350
So then you know, not to talk
to them about the weather.

318
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,840
But that actually brings
me onto my next topic.

319
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,860
The weather, come on, I'm British.

320
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,510
Of course I'm going to talk
to you about the weather.

321
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,960
I did save this one for last,

322
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,200
because I know that it's almost a cliche

323
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
to talk about the weather in Britain

324
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,180
whilst participating in small talk.

325
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,980
But our weather just changes so much.

326
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,970
When I started filming
this video, it was sunny,

327
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,053
and now it looks like it's going to rain.

328
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,020
Look at me I'm talking about the weather.

329
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,110
If it's a beautiful day,

330
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,570
you can say it's such a
beautiful day, isn't it?

331
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,090
And then everyone else
goes, oh yes, it is lovely.

332
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,923
Yes, very nice.

333
00:14:09,923 --> 00:14:11,620
Haven't had one like this in ages.

334
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,530
Or an alternative,

335
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,060
we couldn't ask for a nicer day, could we?

336
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,610
And everyone else goes,
no, no we couldn't.

337
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,443
It's wonderful.

338
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:19,276
It's just stuffy.

339
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,590
So nice.

340
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,410
Fortunately, we don't have
many days like that in the UK

341
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,840
so we don't get to be,
Oh, yes, yes, yes, lovely,

342
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,830
too frequently.

343
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,980
If it's very sunny, you could say,

344
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,870
did you bring the sunshine with you

345
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,720
or did you order the
sunshine, oh, it's lovely.

346
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,850
And then you can have a little joke

347
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,270
about yes, yes, I brought
it with me in my suitcase

348
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:40,173
from Spain.

349
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,870
So in the UK, we have a
love-hate relationship

350
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,180
with the meteorologist,
with the weatherperson,

351
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,330
because when they tell us
it's going to be sunny,

352
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,690
we love them but when they
tell us it's going to rain

353
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,780
we just don't believe them.

354
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,570
And then we get caught out
and about with no umbrella.

355
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,510
One great topic to bring
up is I saw on the weather

356
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,530
this morning that it's going
to rain, it's going to hail,

357
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:05,460
it's going to be sunny,
there's going to be snow.

358
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,670
What do you think?

359
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,320
And then you can follow
up with what do you think?

360
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,153
Do you believe them?

361
00:15:09,153 --> 00:15:10,460
Do you trust them?

362
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,980
Another version is, do you trust
the weather forecast today?

363
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,120
Because they said it's going
to rain but it looks lovely.

364
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,580
If it has been raining a lot,

365
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,570
you can say can you
believe how wet it's been?

366
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,970
Or can you believe all this
rain we've been having?

367
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,640
If you're in a foreign
country you can say,

368
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,740
is the weather normally like this?

369
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,260
Is it usually like this?

370
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,350
A really interesting one
is what's the worst weather

371
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,240
you've ever experienced.

372
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,340
And that invites them to
talk about maybe a country

373
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,230
they've visited or just a prolonged period

374
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,860
of terrible weather.

375
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,280
So I've got two more small talk questions

376
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,310
about the weather that
kind of take the Mickey.

377
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:53,120
They joke about small talk
relating to the weather.

378
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,340
The first one is why do we
always end up making small talk

379
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,390
about the weather?

380
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,150
And then that invites you
to make some small talk

381
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,690
about the weather together.

382
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,760
And the last one is, is
it okay if I try to talk

383
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,400
to you by pretending that
I'm really interested

384
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,511
in the weather?

385
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:08,630
(laughs)

386
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,370
I think that's a great
one to use at a situation

387
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,360
like a conference where small talk

388
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,210
can get a little bit much.

389
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,043
Right.

390
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,190
That is it for today's lesson.

391
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,100
I hope you enjoyed it, and I
hope you learned something.

392
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,290

00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,600
englishwithlucy.co.uk,

405
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,900
where I've got a really cool,

406
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,740
if I do say so myself pronunciation tool,

407
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,380
where you can click on different phonemes

408
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,440
and hear me pronounce those phonemes

409
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,573
and words containing those phonemes.

410
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,690
If you'd like to practise your vocabulary

411
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:11,069
and your listening skills even further

412
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,489
then I have got a vlogging channel

413
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,260
where I document my life here
in the English countryside

414
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,700
and every single blog is fully subtitled.

415
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,650
I will see you soon for another lesson.

416
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:23,612
(coughs)

417
00:17:23,612 --> 00:17:28,369
I promise it's not COVID and
it can't pass through lenses.

418
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:30,650
I recently took a class called,

419
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,970
what is it called, right?

420
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:35,283
A fly-and-flop is what
it says on the card.

421
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:39,690
It says on the cards,
what it says on the label.

422
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:40,523
Tin.

423
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:42,880
Don't forget to connect with
me on all of my social media.

I've got my Instagram.

425
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,320
What else have I got?

426
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,770
I think what I was trying to
say is you have an ologist.

427
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,623
But if really muscly,
you have a meteorologist.

428
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,860
Terrible.

429
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,443
(upbeat music)
