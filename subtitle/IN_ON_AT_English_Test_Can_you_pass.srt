00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:08,320
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. 
In, on, at, let's talk about it. 

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:22,640
I forget. Did I put it in the cabinet, on the 
shelf, or at the front door? In, on, and at  

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,960
are three little words that are often tricky for 
English learners, and maybe they are for you too.  

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,120
But today I have some good news. Today you are 
going to test your skills and knowledge of in,  

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:46,800
on, and at with a fun little test. Fun? Test? Yes.
If you have been watching my lessons or other  

6
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,720
English content, you have been inputting real 
useful English. And our brains are amazing  

7
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,400
things. Our brains are always trying to sort 
out which words go where. Our brains are amazing  

8
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,040
at recognizing a pattern. The clouds are 
dark. It's going to rain. This is a pattern.  

9
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:18,960
But I have a little hunch. A hunch is like a 
guess. Do you think that these words in, on,  

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:27,360
and at are tricky for you? These little words, 
they're called prepositions. I have a hunch  

11
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:35,040
that you know more than you think you do.
These words and concepts seem tricky,  

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,800
but our brains are amazing. You are amazing. Your 
brain has already created some patterns using in,  

13
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,560
on, and at. So I think you are going to do better 
on this test than you think you will. Am I right?  

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,760
Am I wrong? Let's find out. Plus, you'll 
learn five common fixed phrases using in,  

15
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,720
on, and at, at the end of this lesson.
And of course, to help you remember everything  

16
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:11,360
that you've learned today, I have created 
a free PDF worksheet with all of the ideas,  

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,080
rules, concepts, sample sentences. And at the end 
of the PDF, you will be able to answer Vanessa's  

18
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,320
challenge question. You can download this free 
PDF worksheet with the link in the description. 

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,920
Before we start with our test, let's review 
a few simple rules. Each of the prepositions  

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:40,000
in, on, and at can be used to talk about space 
and time. Let's take a look at some examples  

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,440
so that we can study before the test.
In. I put the medicine in the cabinet,  

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,320
in the afternoon. Here we have 
space, in the cabinet, and time,  

23
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:06,160
in the afternoon. We use in for an enclosed 
space, in the cabinet. And for a general time,  

24
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,560
usually a time of day, in the morning, in the 
afternoon, in the evening, this general time. 

25
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:24,000
On. I put my phone on the shelf on Monday. 
Here we have space, on the shelf, and time, on  

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,360
Monday. Usually on is with a surface. Sometimes 
it's a flat surface. Sometimes it's not.  

27
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,840
But we talk about on with a surface, on the shelf. 
And for time we're talking about a specific day,  

28
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,720
on Monday, on Tuesday, on Wednesday. 
This video is coming out on Friday. 

29
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:59,040
And at. Please be at the entrance of the park 
at 4:00 PM. We have space, at the entrance,  

30
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:08,320
and time, at 4:00 PM. At the entrance of the 
park is a specific place, a specific point,  

31
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:18,399
at the entrance of the park. And for time, at 4:00 
PM, we are talking about a specific time, at 4:00  

32
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:27,280
PM, at 9:00 PM, at 3:00 AM, this specific time.
So we've had a little review here.  

33
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,880
Don't stress too much about the rules. I want 
you to look into your heart as I give you these  

34
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,520
test sentences. I want you to choose which word 
is the best to fill in each of these sentences.  

35
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,560
Maybe you remember the rules, maybe you 
don't. That's okay. Remember those patterns  

36
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,000
we talked about. Your brain has created some 
patterns already using these three words. 

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,560
So let's get started with sentence 
number one. Did you find your coat  

38
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:03,600
the closet? Did you find your coat in, on, at the 
closet? I'll give you three seconds to decide.  

39
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:16,400
Did you find your coat in the closet? In is 
an enclosed space. The closet is an enclosed  

40
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,000
space. Did you find your coat in the closet?
Number two. My favorite cafe is the end of  

41
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,400
this street. My favorite cafe is 
in, on, at the end of this street.  

42
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:41,920
What do you think? Three, two, one. My 
favorite cafe is at the end of this street.  

43
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,720
Here we're talking about a specific place, 
a specific point. At the end of the street  

44
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,880
is my favorite cafe. How are you doing 
so far? Take a deep breath. You got this. 

45
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,960
All right, let's go to number three. 
Oh no. I spilled my coffee my homework.  

46
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Oh no. I spilled my coffee in, on, at my homework. 
Three, two, one. Oh, no. I spilled my coffee on  

47
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:25,760
my work. Here we're talking about the surface of 
my homework. It also happens to be a flat surface.  

48
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:32,160
Like I mentioned, we sometimes use this 
for flat surfaces, on my homework. Oh man.  

49
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,200
Now I'm going to have to explain this to my 
teacher. I spilled my coffee on my homework. 

50
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:48,080
Number four. I enjoy taking walks early the 
morning. I enjoy taking walks early in, on,  

51
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:58,960
at the morning. Three, two, one. I enjoy taking 
walks early in the morning. Here we are talking  

52
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:07,440
about a general time of day. We're not talking 
about 9:00 AM. We're talking about a general time,  

53
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,760
in the morning, in the afternoon. And this is one 
of the keys to remembering prepositions, is when  

54
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:20,080
you can remember a full phrase, in the morning, 
you're not going to need to think about the rules.  

55
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,560
All right, general time, specific time, time. 
No, you don't need to think about that because  

56
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,840
you know the full phrase. So sentences like this 
are great ways to remember these tricky words.  

57
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:40,160
In the morning. Let's go to the next question.
Number five. My date will be here 5:15. My date  

58
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:48,400
will be here in, on, at 5:15. We're talking 
about time here. I'll give you three seconds.  

59
00:07:50,560 --> 00:08:02,160
My date will be here at 5:15. Hopefully not 5:14. 
Hopefully not 5:16, 5:15. Maybe not exactly,  

60
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:12,000
but you know what I mean? Here we're talking 
about a specific time, 5:15, 6;15, 7:45,  

61
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,800
at 5:15. All right, let's get to the next one.
Number six. I love to spend summer vacation  

62
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,920
the mountains. I love to spend summer 
vacation in, on, at the mountains.  

63
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,360
Give you three seconds. Three, two, one. 
The best answer for this sentence is  

64
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,920
I love to spend summer vacation in the mountains. 
We're not talking about digging a hole in the  

65
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:53,280
mountains and going inside the dirt and the 
rocks. No. This would really be an enclosed space,  

66
00:08:53,280 --> 00:09:00,160
in the closet, in the cabinet. But 
sometimes we use the idea of an enclosed  

67
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,840
space a little bit more loosely. So here we're 
talking about being surrounded by the mountains.  

68
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:15,200
It's the idea that you're somewhat enclosed 
in the warm embrace of the mountains. So  

69
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,240
sometimes we do use this a little bit more 
loosely. Well, you can get the idea here. 

70
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:28,560
Number seven, we are having dinner my favorite 
restaurant. We're having dinner in, on,  

71
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,320
at my favorite restaurant. I'll give 
you three seconds. Three, two, one.  

72
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:45,040
We're having dinner at my favorite restaurant. 
This is a specific place, a specific point. At  

73
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,040
my favorite restaurant. Well, that's where we're 
going to be having dinner. We're having dinner at  

74
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:58,000
my favorite restaurant, a specific place.
Number eight. I jumped when he tapped me  

75
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:11,680
the shoulder. I jumped when he tapped me in, on, 
at the shoulder. Three, two, one. I jumped when he  

76
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:20,080
tapped me on the shoulder. This is also a little 
more loose, but we're talking about the surface of  

77
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:28,160
my shoulder, the surface of my skin. When 
he tapped me on the shoulder, this is the  

78
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,440
surface of it. It's not inside my skin. This is 
just the surface. He tapped me on the shoulder. 

79
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,000
How are you doing? We have two more 
sentences. Let's go to number nine.  

80
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,680
Do you have a date Saturday night? Do you have a 
date in, on, at Saturday night? Do you remember  

81
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:57,520
which one we should use with days like Saturday? 
I'll give you three seconds. Three, two, one.  

82
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:08,720
Do you have a date on Saturday night? We use 
on for a specific day, on Saturday, on Friday,  

83
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:16,240
on Tuesday. Do you have a date on Saturday night?
And our final test question before we get to five  

84
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:26,160
fixed phrases is using in, on, and at is this. You 
can email me contact@speakenglishwithvanessa.com.  

85
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,120
This is a common phrase we use in business, or 
whenever you need to tell someone your email  

86
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:39,600
address. So it's a good expression to remember. 
You can email me in, on, or at my email address.  

87
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:50,000
Three, two, one. You can email me at 
contact@speakenglishwithvanessa.com. This  

88
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,160
is also a more figurative way to use a specific 
place. So we said at my favorite restaurant,  

89
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:05,280
at the entrance of the park. But this is not a 
place you can go. You can't go physically to my  

90
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:12,080
email address. So we're going to use this a little 
bit more loosely and we can say, you can email me  

91
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:20,000
at, this is my specific email address. You can 
email me at contact@speakenglishwithvanessa.com. 

92
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,440
Great. Are you ready for five bonus 
fixed phrases that include in, on,  

93
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,600
or at? These are kind of outside the rules 
of what we just talked about, but I want  

94
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,280
you to look into your heart and to guess which 
preposition do you think would be the best fit? 

95
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,480
Let's look at this sentence. The building is fire.  

96
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,960
The building is in, on, at fire. What is the 
fixed phrase we're looking for here? Three,  

97
00:12:50,960 --> 00:13:00,160
two, one. The building is on fire. Ah, run. 
So here we're using the fixed phrase to be on  

98
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,160
fire. We can use this in a real way, that there 
are flames coming up from the building. So get out  

99
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:12,960
of the building. It's on fire. But we can also use 
this for more figurative ways. For example, you  

100
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:20,560
might say, "My motivation for learning English is 
on fire from watching Vanessa's video," or talking  

101
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:28,400
about your motivation is on fire. Or we might say, 
"I'm on fire for English." This is talking about a  

102
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:36,480
more figurative way of talking about fire that of 
course there is not fire on you, but we're talking  

103
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,240
about in your heart. There is an excitement. 
There's determination. There's motivation. I'm  

104
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,920
on fire for English. My motivation is on fire. 
And that is another way to use this expression. 

105
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,720
All right, let's go to the next sentence. Do 
you believe love at first sight? Do you believe  

106
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,040
in, on, at love at first sight? I'll 
give you three seconds. Three, two, one.  

107
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,480
Do you believe in love at first sight? 
Here our fixed expression is to believe in  

108
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,760
something. You can believe in love. You can 
believe in peace. You can believe in your  

109
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,760
ability to learn English. You can believe in 
something. And this means you have hope that  

110
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:28,560
it will happen. You have high hopes that this 
will come true. I believe in love. Wonderful. 

111
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,600
Question number 13. He is really good juggling. 
Juggling is when you throw balls in the air.  

112
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:46,720
He is really good in, on, at juggling. I'll 
tell you in three, two, one. He is really good  

113
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,600
at juggling. Here we're going to use the fixed 
expression to be good at something. This is used  

114
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,120
all the time. You might say, "I thought that 
I wasn't good at English. And then I found  

115
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,840
Vanessa's lessons and realized, 'Oh, it's not too 
hard. I can do this.'" You can be good at English. 

116
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,440
Number 14. Do you have this a smaller size? This 
is a common expression when you're shopping.  

117
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:23,760
Do you have this in, on, or at a smaller size? 
Three, two, one. Do you have this in a smaller  

118
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,720
size? This expression, to be in a size or color is 
commonly used when we're shopping and we're trying  

119
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,760
to find the best thing that we are looking 
for. So you might say, "Do you have this in  

120
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:43,040
a large? Do you have this in a medium?" Or we 
can use it for color. "Do you have this in red?  

121
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,320
Do you have this in stripes?" Great. This is a 
great expression to use when you're shopping. 

122
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,680
And our final test question. Are 
you ready, drum roll, is my date was  

123
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:08,320
his phone all night. It was so rude. My date was 
in, on, at his phone all night. Such a shame.  

124
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:20,080
Three, two, one. My date was on his phone all 
night. It was so rude. He's not actually standing  

125
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:27,200
on his phone, but instead that means he's using 
his phone. And this is a common expression, to be  

126
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,680
on your phone. Sometimes you could 
say this maybe to teenagers. "Hey,  

127
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:41,920
get off your phone. You are on your phone all day. 
Why are you always on your phone? I wish I wasn't  

128
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,480
on my phone so much." It doesn't mean that 
you're standing on your phone. It just means  

129
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,360
you're using your phone. So this is a great 
fixed expression to know, to be on your phone. 

130
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,840
So let's do a little review. I'm going to 
read all of these sentences one more time  

131
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:00,800
and I would like you to try to say them out loud 
with me. Do you think you can do this? Of course,  

132
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,839
you can, because you are good at English. 
Let's say all of these sentences together. 

133
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:12,959
Did you find your coat in the closet? I 
enjoy taking walks early in the morning.  

134
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:22,079
I love to spend summer vacation in the mountains. 
Do you have this in a smaller size? Do you believe  

135
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:29,520
in love at first sight? Oh no. I spilled 
coffee on my homework. Do you have a date  

136
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,240
on Saturday night? I jumped when he tapped 
me on the shoulder. The building is on fire.  

137
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,640
My date was on his phone the whole night. It 
was so rude. My favorite cafe is at the end of  

138
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:56,160
this street. My date will be here at 5:15. We are 
having dinner at my favorite restaurant. You can  

139
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,680
email me at contact@speakenglishwithvanessa.com. 
He is really good at juggling. 

140
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:11,440
So how did you do on this test? I hope that it was 
better than you imagined, because your brain is  

141
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,440
amazing. You are amazing. You have been creating 
patterns by watching my videos and other English  

142
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,920
content so that these seemingly tricky words 
are maybe actually easier than you thought. 

143
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,000
