1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,855
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

2
00:00:03,855 --> 00:00:07,150
I''ve got a very interesting English lesson for you today.

3
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:10,902
I'm going to teach you seven extremely common English

4
00:00:10,902 --> 00:00:15,410
linking words plus their professional equivalents.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,835
So linking words are words that link ideas together

6
00:00:19,835 --> 00:00:23,672
as you speak and you write so it's a really useful skill to have.

7
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:25,605
They are useful words to know.

8
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:28,595
But in this lesson we're going to practise the casual,

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:31,642
everyday conversational linking words

10
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:35,881
alongside the more formal alternatives that will make you sound

11
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:40,402
more professional when you're linking ideas together in English.

12
00:00:40,402 --> 00:00:43,867
You probably know already that spoken English is

13
00:00:43,867 --> 00:00:48,466
generally more casual whereas written English is more formal.

14
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:52,694
And it's important to understand the formal and the informal

15
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:54,113
uses of language.

16
00:00:54,113 --> 00:00:56,929
When you use formal language while you're speaking in just

17
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:59,874
a regular everyday conversation,

18
00:00:59,874 --> 00:01:04,658
there is a danger that you'll sound a bit stiff and a bit serious.

19
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:06,930
And if you use the casual,

20
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,337
informal versions in a professional context,

21
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:14,467
well that's okay but you just might not sound as convincing

22
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:16,530
or as professional as you want to.

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,147
All of the words in this lesson are extremely useful to help you

24
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:24,231
communicate clearly and effectively in any situation

25
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:27,640
so I recommend you watch it all the way through to the end.

26
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,764
I just want to take a few seconds here to give a little shout-out

27
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,157

even if you don't have a lot of time to spare.

38
00:02:13,449 --> 00:02:16,975

I've put the link down in the description below,

43
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,383
make sure you check it out and I hope to see you inside!

44
00:02:34,732 --> 00:02:39,123
Today you get to meet casual Emma and professional Emma.

45
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:44,013
Casual Emma is going to tell you about her recent trip to Portugal.

46
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:47,240
And professional Emma is going to talk to you about

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,808
tourism trends in Portugal.

48
00:02:49,808 --> 00:02:54,063
Now I want you to sit back and watch and enjoy the story

49
00:02:54,063 --> 00:02:58,436
but all the while see if you can identify some of the linking words

50
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,641
that get used.

51
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:05,256
Words in my sentences that link to ideas or two thoughts together.

52
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:08,185
I just got back from my trip to Portugal.

53
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:09,582
And I'm exhausted.

54
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:11,236
It was an amazing trip

55
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:14,542
but I'm really struggling with the jetlag this time.

56
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:17,539
If I can afford it, I'd fly business class

57
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,219
or maybe break up the trip by staying a night in Dubai.

58
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:22,103
That might help.

59
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:25,841
We wanted really comfortable weather so we travelled in May.

60
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:30,116
It wasn't too hot, it wasn't too cold, it was perfect.

61
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:33,619
I'd love to go back again soon because there's just

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,172
still so much I want to see and do.

63
00:03:36,172 --> 00:03:41,276
I really enjoyed the food on this trip, sweets like pasteis de nata,

64
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:46,694
custard tarts and seafood like bacahlau, salted cod.

65
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:51,091
Everything in Portugal is beautiful, especially those

66
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:54,192
stunning patterned tiles that you see everywhere.

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,659
Did you notice some of the linking words while I was talking?

68
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,365
I used and,

69
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:00,545
or,

70
00:04:01,127 --> 00:04:02,112
but,

71
00:04:02,811 --> 00:04:03,680
so

72
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,749
because,

73
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:07,474
like

74
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:10,933
and especially.

75
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:15,323
These are some of the most common linking words in English

76
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:19,199
and I feel pretty confident that you know at least

77
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,216
some of them.

78
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,976
Most of them if not all of them.

79
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:24,536
But if you're feeling a little unsure about the

80
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:28,480
function or the meaning in English sentences, don't worry  

81
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,100
because we're going to review how all of these words are used

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,309
in English, what their function is, once we hear from

83
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,806
professional Emma.

84
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:39,479
Professional Emma is going to give you a presentation

85
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,951
and it's going to feel a little more formal because of the language

86
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,123
that she's using.

87
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:47,670
In it, you're going to hear seven more linking words

88
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,088
that are often used in this type of context, in this formal context.

89
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:55,689
All of these words are still very common in spoken English

90
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:57,880
but they are noticeably more

91
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,466
formal than the ones we just went through.

92
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:04,431
Good morning! I'm here today to talk to you about tourism

93
00:05:04,431 --> 00:05:09,534
in Portugal. Portugal experiences mild winters and hot summers.

94
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:13,191
As a result, it's popular in summer as well as winter.

95
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:16,605
The diverse landscape ensures that tourists can enjoy

96
00:05:16,605 --> 00:05:20,647
either a coastal holiday or a trip to the mountains.

97
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:24,676
In fact, Portugal was voted the best European destination

98
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:27,687
to visit by car in 2021.

99
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:32,179
Since Portugal shares a border with Spain, it's logical that many

100
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:37,685
tourists are Spanish. Lisbon is by far the most popular destination.

101
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:42,159
Tourists enjoy activities such as visiting the Alfama neighbourhood

102
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:46,631
or catching the vintage tram 28 through historic neighbourhoods.

103
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:51,453
International tourism has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels

104
00:05:51,593 --> 00:05:55,443
whereas domestic tourism is currently booming.

105
00:05:55,443 --> 00:05:59,973
There's just so much to see, even for the Portuguese themselves.

106
00:06:00,765 --> 00:06:03,674
So did you catch any of these linking words?

107
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:08,545
Each one of them is the formal or more professional equivalent

108
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:11,113
of the linking words that we heard before.

109
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:14,494
Professional Emma used words like as well as,

110
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,983
whereas,

111
00:06:16,123 --> 00:06:17,529
either or,

112
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,124
as a result.

113
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:20,761
since, 

114
00:06:20,761 --> 00:06:21,961
such as,

115
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,220
in fact.

116
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,895
We use and and as well as

117
00:06:26,895 --> 00:06:32,131
for adding information. We can replace and with as well as

118
00:06:32,271 --> 00:06:35,162
if you want to sound a little bit more formal or

119
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:39,216
maybe you just want to add a little bit of variety into your sentence

120
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:43,940
so instead of saying and and and and,

121
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,841
we can add that variety by using as well as.

122
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,282
Portugal is a popular destination in summer and winter.

123
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:57,665
Or we could say it's popular in summer as well as winter.

124
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:03,862
To show contrast we can use but in casual conversational English

125
00:07:03,862 --> 00:07:07,920
and whereas to sound a little bit more professional.

126
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,503
International tourism has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels

127
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:15,001
but domestic tourism is booming

128
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,479
and we can simply switch out but for whereas.

129
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,539
Whereas domestic tourism is booming.

130
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,791
But is definitely a way more common way to contrast ideas

131
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:28,389
but that's exactly why it helps

132
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,047
to use whereas to sound a little bit more intelligent,

133
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:35,453
a little bit more official, a little bit more professional.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,270
Now let's look at or and either or.

135
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,799
We use these conjunctions to show alternatives or options

136
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:45,311
or choices.

137
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:49,877
Enjoy a coastal holiday or a trip to the mountains.

138
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:53,219
So here we have one option and here's the other.

139
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,246
Option one and option two.

140
00:07:55,246 --> 00:07:59,339
Using either or has the same meaning.

141
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,974
Enjoy either a coastal holiday or a trip to the mountains.

142
00:08:03,974 --> 00:08:09,849
One important thing to note here is that we use or and either or

143
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:14,723
to connect two things of the same grammatical type in a sentence

144
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:19,491
so that means we connect two nouns or two verbs

145
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,608
or two clauses together.

146
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:24,006
Two of the same thing in the sentence.

147
00:08:24,006 --> 00:08:27,981
Do you prefer chips or popcorn? So we're connecting nouns.

148
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:31,817
Either you're driving me home or I'm catching a taxi.

149
00:08:31,817 --> 00:08:33,981
So here we're connecting clauses.

150
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,513
Let's take a closer look at this word here for a second.

151
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:38,746
Is it either?

152
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:40,385
Or either?

153
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,749
Have you heard English speakers using

154
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:44,554
both types of pronunciation?

155
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:48,181
Both of them are correct. I want you to practise a little with me.

156
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:56,719
Either.

157
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:01,266
You could choose either or either, it really makes no difference

158
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:03,565
at all. in fact, I use them both.

159
00:09:03,868 --> 00:09:08,324
But this interesting combination of pronunciation creates

160
00:09:08,324 --> 00:09:11,637
another really useful interesting expression that you can learn.

161
00:09:11,823 --> 00:09:15,220
If someone gives you two options to choose from

162
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:18,385
but you really don't care which one

163
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,992
you can say either, either

164
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:22,591
or

165
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:25,505
either or, I don't mind.

166
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,644
So it literally means

167
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,923
I'm not fussed, I don't mind, I don't care which one we do because

168
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:34,749
both of them are fine with me.

169
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:35,903
Either, either.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,959
Either, or.

171
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,754
So connects a reason with a result.

172
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:43,653
The weather is nice all year

173
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:47,093
so Portugal is popular with tourists.

174
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,676
So here's the reason, the nice weather.

175
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:55,279
And the result is that Portugal is popular.

176
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,971
When we use so in this way to connect a reason to a result

177
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:03,389
in our sentence, so always comes in the middle

178
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:06,616
of our sentence because it's linking these two clauses,

179
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:08,298
these two ideas together.

180
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:14,013
And we can replace so with as a result almost interchangeably.

181
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:18,792
So is more casual, as a result is more formal

182
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:22,816
but there is one little change that we need to make,

183
00:10:22,979 --> 00:10:25,949
really important little change. We need to add

184
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,540
and ahead of as a result.

185
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,894
If it's in the middle of a sentence we must make sure that we add

186
00:10:32,894 --> 00:10:33,626
and.

187
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:38,611
Portugal has nice weather and as a result, it's very popular

188
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,676
with tourists.

189
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,622
We can also use as a result

190
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:44,249
at the beginning of our sentence as well.

191
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:49,164
As a result of the nice weather, Portugal is popular with tourists.

192
00:10:49,164 --> 00:10:52,695
So can you see the difference in the way that these two examples

193
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:53,608
are structured?

194
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:58,294
Here as a result connects two full sentences together

195
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:02,373
but here it connects a noun phrase with a sentence.

196
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,514
Now sometimes you want to focus on the reason for something

197
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:09,215
rather than the result.

198
00:11:09,215 --> 00:11:13,987
That's when because and since come in really handy.

199
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:16,292
Because the weather is nice all year,

200
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,499
Portugal is popular with tourists.

201
00:11:18,499 --> 00:11:23,605
Or since the weather is nice, Portugal is popular with tourists.

202
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,759
Because is really common in both speaking and writing

203
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,583
but since is definitely the more formal choice here.

204
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:35,190
They can both be placed at the beginning of a sentence

205
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,656
which helps to put some extra focus on

206
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,400
the reason for something.

207
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,081
And both of them can be used in the middle of a sentence.

208
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:47,430
I want to go back to Portugal because there's so much to see!

209
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:49,104
I want to go back to Portugal 

210
00:11:49,104 --> 00:11:51,400
since there's still so much to see.

211
00:11:51,703 --> 00:11:56,569
Now if you're trying to decide between so and as a result

212
00:11:56,569 --> 00:11:59,469
or because and since,

213
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:02,172
you need to think about where you want

214
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,812
the focus of your sentence to be, on the reason

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,430
or the result? 

216
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,373
That's how you make your choice.

217
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,296
Next up we have like and such as.

218
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:19,596
Now I want you to forget about to like which means enjoy.

219
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:23,421
When we're using like as a conjunction or a linking word like this

220
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:25,423
it means for example.

221
00:12:25,423 --> 00:12:31,746
In Portugal, I really enjoyed the food, sweets like pasteis de nata

222
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,183
and seafood like bacalhau.

223
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:39,066
So we can replace like with for example or such as

224
00:12:39,066 --> 00:12:42,785
and in a professional or a formal setting, they're much better

225
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:46,549
choices but in casual everyday conversations,

226
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:50,927
like sounds so much more natural, friendly and relaxed.

227
00:12:50,927 --> 00:12:53,483
There's one more thing that I want to point out.

228
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,821
Have a look.

229
00:12:55,683 --> 00:13:00,872
Tourists enjoy activities such as visiting the Alfama neighbourhood

230
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:03,307
or catching tram 28.

231
00:13:03,307 --> 00:13:07,859
Like and such are always followed by a noun or a pronoun,

232
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:11,978
aren't they? Like pasteis de nata and bacalhau.

233
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:15,706
So if you want to use a verb you need to make sure that it's 

234
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:18,714
a gerund, it's the -ing form like

235
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,431
visiting or catching here.

236
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:26,141
Last of all we have especially and in fact.

237
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:29,549
These words are not actually interchangeable but they have a

238
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:32,569
similar function in our sentences.

239
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,333
Both of them are used to emphasise

240
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,631
a point, especially is an adverb and we use it to

241
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:43,838
add emphasis to something, it shows that one thing 

242
00:13:43,838 --> 00:13:47,915
is more of something than other things or people.

243
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:50,393
Everything in Portugal is beautiful,

244
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:52,792
especially the patterned pavements.

245
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:56,234
The landscape is beautiful, the people are beautiful

246
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:59,233
but the patterned pavements are the most

247
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:00,591
beautiful part for me.

248
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:05,101
In fact is what we call a discourse marker, something that helps us

249
00:14:05,101 --> 00:14:10,229
to order and connect our ideas as we speak or we write.

250
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:13,207
And we use in fact to give more information

251
00:14:13,207 --> 00:14:15,083
or emphasise something.

252
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:17,895
Portugal is popular with tourists.

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,206
In fact, Portugal was voted

254
00:14:20,206 --> 00:14:22,995
best European destination to visit by car.

255
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:28,220
To emphasise the popularity of Portugal, I'm using in fact

256
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,322
to add extra information and to highlight

257
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:35,081
this important information and draw attention to it

258
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:36,618
so as you're speaking.

259
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:40,637
It makes people listen when you say in fact.

260
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,609
Here's some extra information that's interesting.

261
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:47,000
It's usually used to introduce a sentence but

262
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:49,493
in some circumstances,

263
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:51,936
you'll see it at the end of a sentence as well.

264
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,137
Portugal was voted best European destination to visit by car,

265
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:57,999
in fact.

266
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,926
Again it's adding that emphasis, that 

267
00:15:00,926 --> 00:15:03,218
interesting extra piece of information

268
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,576
that you may not have known.

269
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,701
So that's it for today's lesson.

270
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:11,828
I hope you learned something new, something interesting.

271
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:12,992
In fact

272
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,120
you could prove it to me by writing some of your own sentences  

273
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,909
down in the comments below.

274
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:21,920
I'll head down there now to check them out!
