1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:02,925
How many times have you
shared an opinion in English,

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:08,285
but halfway through your words weren't
really coming together as smoothly

3
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:09,378
as you wanted?

4
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:14,125
Maybe you found yourself saying too
much or searching for the right words,

5
00:00:14,126 --> 00:00:17,805
trying to wrap up your thoughts.
This might happen, for example,

6
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:22,805
when a coworker asks for your
opinion in a meeting and again,

7
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:26,965
you have a difficult time explaining
why you have a certain perspective

8
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:32,445
or perhaps a friend shares her thoughts
about a movie you just saw. And again,

9
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,725
you're not really sure how
to put your ideas into place.

10
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:40,045
If that sounds familiar to you,
here's what I want you to know.

11
00:00:40,475 --> 00:00:43,365
It's not at all because your
English isn't good enough.

12
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:47,165
It's simply because you don't have
the right connectors in place.

13
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:48,725
Words like because.

14
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:54,445
So that and due to these
connectors improve your flow and

15
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:59,085
help your ideas to feel
structured rather than scattered.

16
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:02,125
They also help you explain your reasoning,

17
00:01:02,126 --> 00:01:06,285
which makes your opinion stronger
and more engaging. Ultimately,

18
00:01:06,286 --> 00:01:09,405
this helps you sound
confident and professional.

19
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:13,084
Instead of hesitant or
unsure of your own opinions.

20
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,525
I want you to think about it for a moment.

21
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:20,365
When you hear someone confidently
explain why they believe something,

22
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:23,405
doesn't it make their
opinion more persuasive?

23
00:01:23,785 --> 00:01:27,725
That's exactly what we're going to work
on today. By the end of this lesson,

24
00:01:28,065 --> 00:01:32,885
you'll have the best professional
connectors to explain your reasoning

25
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:34,225
smoothly.

26
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:38,885
You'll also have a simple structure to
make your opinions sound polished and

27
00:01:38,886 --> 00:01:41,125
professional in English. Ultimately,

28
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:46,125
you'll have more confidence in sharing
your thoughts without hesitation or

29
00:01:46,145 --> 00:01:47,845
over-explaining. Now,

30
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:51,765
I want you to stick with me because at
the end I do have a challenge for you so

31
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:55,765
you can put all of these strategies
together and start using the right

32
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:57,725
connectors to get started.

33
00:01:57,855 --> 00:02:02,685
Let's talk about how to structure your
opinion so that it's clear, logical,

34
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:03,925
and easy to follow.

35
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:08,925
English speakers naturally use a
three part structure when we're

36
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,965
expressing an opinion. The first step
is to clearly state your opinion.

37
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:19,165
This is where you introduce your
perspective in a direct confident

38
00:02:19,166 --> 00:02:23,805
way. Most of the time you're going to
hear this with a sentence starter like I

39
00:02:23,806 --> 00:02:26,525
believe, I think I would say,

40
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:31,965
and I feel following that immediate
statement of your perspective.

41
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:36,925
Step two is to explain why, and this
is where the connectors come in.

42
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:42,125
Strong opinions should be
supported by clear reasoning and

43
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:46,245
connectors help you explain
the why behind your statement.

44
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:51,005
So again, this would include
words such as because since,

45
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:55,764
and due to however, we're going to
learn many more in this lesson today.

46
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:58,725
Before we get there, let's
talk about the third step in a.

47
00:02:58,725 --> 00:02:59,965
Clear logical opinion,

48
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:03,764
wrap it up with a
conclusion or a question.

49
00:03:04,695 --> 00:03:08,325
Doing this makes your opinion
feel complete or finished.

50
00:03:09,065 --> 00:03:13,764
You can do this by reinforcing your
point or inviting further discussion.

51
00:03:14,305 --> 00:03:18,965
For example, after stating your opinion
and why you have it, you might say,

52
00:03:19,425 --> 00:03:22,805
that's why I think this is a good
solution, or what do you think?

53
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,565
Before we get into our
professional connectors,

54
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:31,845
I want to give you two examples of
this step-by-step process in action.

55
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:35,205
We're gonna look at a social
example and a professional,

56
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:39,085
so let's imagine in a
social setting I might say,

57
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:44,125
I think the new wicked movie was great
because the actors did justice to the

58
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:47,165
roles and didn't stray from
the original characters.

59
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:51,485
What did you think about it? I
have my opinion, my reasoning,

60
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:56,405
and a way to reinforce or invite
discussion on that opinion.

61
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,565
And now let's look at
a professional option.

62
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:04,645
I believe we should adjust the project
timeline since the current deadlines

63
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:08,605
don't give us enough time for quality
control. What's your take on this?

64
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:13,815
When you structure your opinion in
English using this three-step process

65
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:18,855
and when you include your reason why
you have that particular opinion,

66
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:23,255
your ideas are more clear
and more persuasive.

67
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:27,335
Now of course, simply following
this structure isn't enough.

68
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,855
The connectors you choose are going
to determine how natural and confident

69
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:33,689
you sound.

70
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:38,255
So let's go deeper into the best
professional connectors you can use

71
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:41,295
to explain your opinions
clearly in English.

72
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:46,255
We're going to explore three categories
of connectors today and we'll start with

73
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:51,135
the most important explaining why you
think something or what happened as

74
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:55,135
a result. We need this because when
you're expressing your opinion,

75
00:04:55,555 --> 00:04:57,895
you're not just saying what you think,

76
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:01,455
you're answering an
important question why,

77
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:04,055
and this is where our connectors come in.

78
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:09,335
So let's start with cause
or the reason why you have a

79
00:05:09,336 --> 00:05:11,295
particular belief or opinion.

80
00:05:12,075 --> 00:05:15,175
In English we have several
go-to words for this.

81
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:20,055
The first is the most common
because which means for this reason.

82
00:05:21,165 --> 00:05:26,095
Next on this list is sense and
we use this when the reason for

83
00:05:26,154 --> 00:05:29,175
an opinion is already
pretty clear or obvious.

84
00:05:30,154 --> 00:05:34,575
Now similar to the word
because we can also use due to

85
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:38,654
it's very similar in meaning
but slightly more formal.

86
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:44,135
And here's one more that has a very
similar meaning just like due to

87
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:49,055
we can use because of these
two function in the same way

88
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:54,095
grammatically however of these
two due to is more formal

89
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:58,485
and because of is used more
often in everyday conversation.

90
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:02,404
Now I've got one more in this
list, but before I go there,

91
00:06:03,085 --> 00:06:05,404
I know you might be thinking Annemarie,

92
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:10,045
it sounds like you've just given me a
list of words that all have very similar

93
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:13,605
meaning. And you're right,
English speakers love variety.

94
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:18,005
We like to use different
vocabulary and sentence structures.

95
00:06:18,355 --> 00:06:22,325
This allows us to have more than
one way to express what we think.

96
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,925
Now you don't have to start
using all of these today.

97
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:31,205
My recommendation is learn one or
two connectors that are new to you.

98
00:06:31,654 --> 00:06:36,605
Start incorporating them into your
conversations and your writing and

99
00:06:36,606 --> 00:06:38,925
then once you're comfortable
you can add a couple more.

100
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:43,925
Now the last one on this
particular list is the word As

101
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:48,805
we use this when we're emphasizing
the result of a situation,

102
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:53,045
let's take a look at how these
work. In real conversations,

103
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:56,964
I want you to imagine you're
talking about your company,

104
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:59,245
the place where you
work, and you might say,

105
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:02,525
I like this company because
the people are friendly.

106
00:07:03,265 --> 00:07:07,005
Or maybe you're making weekend
plans and you could say,

107
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:09,925
since the sun is shining,
let's go to the park.

108
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:15,325
Remember we talked about using sense to
highlight that the reason for something

109
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:16,605
is already clear and obvious.

110
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:20,925
It is clear and obvious to everyone
that the sun is shining and it's a good

111
00:07:20,926 --> 00:07:22,525
reason to go to the park.

112
00:07:23,185 --> 00:07:26,045
If you needed to explain why
you were late to a meeting,

113
00:07:26,545 --> 00:07:29,565
you might say I was late due to traffic.

114
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:33,325
And when letting someone know
why an event was canceled,

115
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:36,805
you could say the meeting was
canceled because of the storm.

116
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:42,525
And here's one more using
as as our local coffee shop

117
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,245
has closed, we have to drive
two miles away for good coffee.

118
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:49,165
Before we move on to our next category,

119
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:54,005
I wanna talk about something that is
grammatically important when we're using

120
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:59,205
the words due to and because
of these are always followed

121
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:02,525
by a noun like traffic, the storm,

122
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,685
the delay for example,

123
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:09,805
I cannot say I was late
due to it was raining.

124
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:13,285
That doesn't work for us.
Instead you would say,

125
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:16,085
I was late because it was raining.

126
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:21,205
This is a simple but important difference.
Now, at the start of this section,

127
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:26,245
I highlighted that we're looking at
words that help us explain why or

128
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,505
what happened,

129
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:32,445
so let's take a look at a few more
connectors that help us express the what

130
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:35,245
happened, what was the
result of something.

131
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:38,045
For that we use words like so,

132
00:08:38,424 --> 00:08:42,803
and this helps us to show a
consequence or an outcome.

133
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:45,245
We might also use witches.

134
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:50,445
Why this explains a reason at the
beginning or the end of a sentence.

135
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:52,725
Let's take a look at a few examples.

136
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:57,845
Let's say that you studied really hard
for some exams and you want to highlight

137
00:08:58,065 --> 00:08:59,725
the result. You might say,

138
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:03,325
I studied hard so I
passed all three exams.

139
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:08,485
Or maybe your team just had a really
successful meeting and in telling someone

140
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,725
else about it, you might
say the meeting went well,

141
00:09:11,934 --> 00:09:14,965
which is why we got the project. Now,

142
00:09:14,966 --> 00:09:17,925
before we move on to our
second category of connectors,

143
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,525
I want to give you a
challenge to practice.

144
00:09:21,045 --> 00:09:24,085
I want you to think about
something that you did recently.

145
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,885
Maybe you just started to learn English,

146
00:09:26,886 --> 00:09:30,725
maybe you changed jobs or
maybe you moved to a new city.

147
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:35,255
How would you explain why? For example,

148
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:38,615
you might start with I started
learning English because,

149
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:43,815
or since I wanted to improve
my communication skills I,

150
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:46,575
or due to my work environment,

151
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:51,495
I decided to take a moment to
finish those example sentences.

152
00:09:51,755 --> 00:09:55,175
As always, you can also share them
with me in the comments below.

153
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:58,895
Now that we've covered
connectors for cause and result,

154
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,015
let's move on to purpose.

155
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:04,975
To further explain the
why behind your decisions.

156
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:07,785
Just like expressing what you think.

157
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:13,145
When you share a thought or a
decision that you've already made,

158
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:15,705
you're not just talking
about what you did,

159
00:10:15,804 --> 00:10:19,065
you might also need to
explain why you did it.

160
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,865
And for that we use purpose connectors.

161
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:28,755
I want to share with you three great
ways to express why you did something.

162
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:31,155
The first is in order to,

163
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:36,595
this is more formal and allows
you to emphasize your intention.

164
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:42,155
Now a more informal everyday
conversational version of in order to

165
00:10:42,415 --> 00:10:46,835
is simply using the word to, and I'll
share an example with you in a moment.

166
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:50,355
The third in this category is so that,

167
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,835
and this focuses on the
ultimate desired response.

168
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:59,755
Here's what all of these would sound
like in real conversational examples.

169
00:11:00,525 --> 00:11:05,434
Let's start with evaluating why you
started to learn English for work.

170
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:07,048
You might say,

171
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:11,235
I'm taking these lessons in order
to communicate better at work.

172
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:15,395
Again, using in order to
is a more formal version.

173
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:20,515
You might also say, I joined this
course to improve my speaking skills,

174
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:25,675
or I'm studying English
so that I can work abroad.

175
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:27,915
Again, in that example,

176
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:32,515
we're emphasizing the ultimate
goal or desire that you have. Now,

177
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:35,875
I want to pause here for a
moment because in category one,

178
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:38,915
focusing on cause and results we had,

179
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:43,395
so as a connector and here
when talking about purpose,

180
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:46,554
we had so that what's the difference?

181
00:11:47,365 --> 00:11:50,155
Let's take a look at two
example sentences to help.

182
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:55,405
The first is I went by
car so that I could take

183
00:11:55,406 --> 00:12:00,005
more luggage to the hotel with
so that we're highlighting the

184
00:12:00,075 --> 00:12:02,285
purpose for making that decision.

185
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:07,245
What pros and cons did we evaluate
in order to come to that decision?

186
00:12:08,265 --> 00:12:09,485
We could also say,

187
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:14,245
I went by car so I was able to
take more luggage to the hotel.

188
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:18,125
Here we're emphasizing
the ultimate result.

189
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,684
It might not have been a factor
in the original decision,

190
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:24,684
but it was a positive result. In the end,

191
00:12:25,804 --> 00:12:30,705
one is about what you intended to do
and the other is about what happened in

192
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:33,665
the end. So now let's do
a quick practice again.

193
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:37,065
I want you to think about a
decision that you've made recently.

194
00:12:37,554 --> 00:12:41,745
Maybe you changed jobs or signed
up for a new English class.

195
00:12:42,665 --> 00:12:44,945
I want you to try
finishing these sentences.

196
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:50,655
I started learning English
two or I changed careers

197
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:55,775
so that and now what if you need to
give more than one reason for your

198
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:56,609
opinion?

199
00:12:56,915 --> 00:13:01,655
That's where our next category of
connectors comes in because sometimes one

200
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,095
reason isn't enough.

201
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:08,495
Maybe you love your neighborhood where
you live and there are multiple reasons

202
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:13,575
why. Or maybe you think a
decision at work is a great idea,

203
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,775
but there's more than one benefit
that you want to highlight.

204
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:19,615
For clear organized speech,

205
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:25,015
we use connectors to add more
details and here's how we

206
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:26,895
can do that. The first,

207
00:13:27,445 --> 00:13:31,615
another reason is this
allows us to add a separate

208
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:37,054
second reason to support a
decision or an opinion we can also

209
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,455
use, plus, this is a bit more casual,

210
00:13:39,825 --> 00:13:44,375
quite often used in everyday
speech similar to plus is using

211
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:48,015
also very neutral and commonly used.

212
00:13:48,755 --> 00:13:51,495
And a fourth option is on top of that.

213
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:56,735
This adds emphasis and may be
used to highlight a surprising

214
00:13:56,755 --> 00:14:00,575
detail. Now again, let's take a
look at all of these in action.

215
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:04,934
Let's say that someone asks you,
do you like your new neighborhood?

216
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:09,335
And you might say, I love
my new neighborhood because
it's so close to work.

217
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:14,215
On top of that my friends live there
and there are many great restaurants

218
00:14:14,275 --> 00:14:15,108
nearby.

219
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:20,175
Or imagine you're trying to explain why
you support a particular company policy.

220
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:25,615
You might say this new work
from home policy is great

221
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:30,215
for those who prefer to work at
different times of the day. Also,

222
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:35,175
it helps employees save money on
commuting. And here's one more.

223
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:40,055
Let's say that you're giving feedback
to someone on a new cafe that you tried.

224
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:44,375
You might say, I love this new
cafe, the coffee's excellent,

225
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:47,295
plus they have delicious pastries. Now,

226
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:52,605
one important thing to keep in mind
about using on top of that or another

227
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:57,445
reason is both of these can
only be used at the beginning

228
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:01,295
of a sentence. And once again,
let's do a bit of practice.

229
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:06,255
I want you to think of something
that you really enjoy or support.

230
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:10,855
It could be your job, a
new hobby, a policy change,

231
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:12,415
or even a favorite restaurant.

232
00:15:13,435 --> 00:15:18,375
How would you give two reasons for
your particular opinion? You could try.

233
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:23,775
I love because and plus or one reason I

234
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:27,255
support is a, another reason is,

235
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:31,655
and now let's do a quick recap.
Today we did quite a few things.

236
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:37,215
We started with a three step
structure to ensure that you can share

237
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:40,015
a clear, well organized
opinion in English.

238
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:45,095
Then we learned a variety of connectors
for cause and result explaining why

239
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,575
something happened. Next,

240
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:52,535
we moved on to purpose connectors
showing why you did something,

241
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:57,735
and finally we learned how to add
extra reasons to strengthen an opinion.

242
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:00,895
So now I want you to put
all of this into practice.

243
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:05,655
Here's my challenge for you. I want
you to think about this question.

244
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,695
Why did you choose to learn
English? In your answer,

245
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:15,135
I want you to try to use at least
two connectors from today's lesson.

246
00:16:16,205 --> 00:16:17,225
You might begin with,

247
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:22,025
I started learning English because
or since I wanted to improve my

248
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:26,305
communication skills or I'm
learning English. So that,

249
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:31,985
and another reason is as always
you can share your answers and

250
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:35,425
your questions with me in
the comments below. Also,

251
00:16:35,445 --> 00:16:38,145
