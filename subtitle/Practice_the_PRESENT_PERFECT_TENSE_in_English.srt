1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:01,619
Emma: Hello.

2
00:00:01,619 --> 00:00:05,790
My name is Emma, and we have a very special
video for you today.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,790
Okay?

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:12,360
In today's video you're going to learn a little
bit of grammar about the present perfect,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,030
and then you are going to play a really fun
game.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,980
Not only are you going to get to play a fun
game, you're also going to get to meet my

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:24,980
sister.

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:30,680
Yes, Emma has a sister, so you'll get to see
my sister a little bit later because she is

9
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,450
going to play the game with us as well.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,250
So, let's get started and let me teach you
this grammar point, so then we can get to

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,480
the fun stuff.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Okay?

13
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,960
So, today we're going to talk about the present
perfect.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,130
The present perfect is a bit of grammar.

15
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,130
Okay?

16
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:53,140
It's a type of tense that many students get
very frustrated with.

17
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,940
They don't know: "Do I use the present perfect?

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,620
Do I use the past tense?"

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,120
It can be really difficult.

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,720
So, when do we use the present perfect, and
what is the present perfect?

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,970
Well, let me first give you an example of
a present perfect sentence, because maybe

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,310
you've seen something like this before.

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:19,610
"Have you ever been to France?", "Have you
ever lived in a different city?", "Has your

24
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,520
sister ever been on TV?"

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,460
These are three examples of the present perfect.

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,650
So, when do we use the present perfect?

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:33,150
Well, there's different times we use the present
perfect in English.

28
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,930
In today's lesson, we're going to focus on
using the present perfect to talk about a

29
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,800
past experience.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,850
So, this is something interesting.

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,420
An experience is usually an interesting experience;
although it doesn't have to be.

32
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,180
So, it's an experience that has happened in the past.

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:59,850
So, it's not happening now, it's not happening
in the future; it's already happened.

34
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,200
It happened before, in the past.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,149
That's why a lot of students have a hard time
with the present perfect because they see

36
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,409
the word "present", and they get confused.

37
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:14,049
"But how can we be talking about the past?"

38
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:21,049
Well, the present perfect can be used to talk
about a past experience, and we use it to

39
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:27,459
talk about a past experience when we're just
talking about something that happened, but

40
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,430
we're not talking about when it happened.

41
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,199
We're not talking about a specific time; 
we're not talking about a date.

42
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,260
We're talking generally about an experience
that happened in the past.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:48,469
So, I wanted to focus on present perfect questions
to ask people about their experiences, because

44
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:54,430
a lot of conversations start this way or
 have this in them.

45
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:01,540
So, when we ask a person a question about
the past experience, we can ask them: "Have

46
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,629
you ever...?"

47
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,870
This indicates we want to know something about
somebody's past.

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,510
"Have you ever been to France?" for example.

49
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,430
So I'm asking you: "In the past, have you
been to France?"

50
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,650
So, to create the present perfect, let's talk
about form now.

51
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,879
We have: "Have you ever" and then we add something
called a past participle to make it the present

52
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,879
perfect.

53
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,269
So, what's a past participle?

54
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:37,510
Well, a "past participle" is a form of the
verb.

55
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:46,650
So, for example, in this case we have the
verb "be", "to be".

56
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,889
The past participle form of the verb "to be"
is "been".

57
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:53,529
Okay?

58
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:58,719
In this case, we have: "Have you ever" and
we have our past participle.

59
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,129
What's a past participle again?

60
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,079
It's a verb in a specific form.

61
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,079
Okay?

62
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,930
So it's a specific form of a verb.

63
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,879
In this case, "lived" is the past participle
of "live" or "to live".

64
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,279
And our last example.

65
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:17,560
Oh, we have "been" again, which I've already discussed.

66
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,539
So, we use past participles in the present
perfect.

67
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:26,440
Now, this is where it gets a little bit challenging.

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,889
There are two different types of past participles;
we have our regular past participles and our

69
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:34,090
irregular past participles.

70
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,889
So, what's a "regular past participle"?

71
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,810
Well, this is a verb where we just add "ed".

72
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,810
Okay?

73
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:51,620
So, for example: "play" becomes "played",
and I add "ed", and that makes it a past participle.

74
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:56,530
Another example is just down here: "lived".

75
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:04,090
"Live", we add "ed" and it becomes "lived",
and that's an example of a regular past participle.

76
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,090
Okay?

77
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,250
So, have you ever...?

78
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,710
Let's think of some other examples.

79
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:19,240
"Have you ever played baseball?", "Have you
ever shopped?", "Have you ever visited England?"

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,639
We add "ed" in each of those cases to make
the past participle.

81
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:31,509
Now, there are some verbs where we do not
add "ed" to make it a past participle.

82
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:34,380
We call these irregular past participles.

83
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:43,889
So, here are some examples: "be" is the verb,
the past participle is irregular, and it is

84
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:45,680
"been".

85
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,439
Or "eat": "I eat cake."

86
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,449
The past participle of "eat" is "eaten".

87
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:53,580
Okay?

88
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,699
And if you visit our website at www.engvid.com,
you can actually see a list of verbs and their

89
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:05,280
past participles, so that can be really helpful,
especially for the irregular ones.

90
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,110
And this is something you just might have
to memorize.

91
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,110
Okay?

92
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:18,210
So, to ask the question about somebody's past
experience: "Have you ever", with the past

93
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,210
participle.

94
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:27,319
"Have you ever been to China?", "Have you
ever played a musical instrument?", "Have

95
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,430
you ever watched TV?"

96
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,819
These are all examples of asking about
 past experiences.

97
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,229
Now, here we're focusing on the subject "you".

98
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:41,689
We can also focus on other subjects, too,
to ask about a past experience.

99
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:48,200
We can say: "Have you", but we can also say:
"Have I" if I've forgotten about a past experience.

100
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,379
"Have I ever seen a ghost?"

101
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:55,810
That's something I probably wouldn't forget
about, but...

102
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,980
Or we can use: "Has she" if we're talking
about a woman: "Has...?

103
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,009
Has your mother been to France?", 
"Has your father been to France?"

104
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:06,060
We can use...

105
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,499
Also use: "Has he..."

106
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:10,840
Or: "Have they" if you're talking about a
group of people.

107
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:19,569
The main thing is that the form "have" has
to match the subject, so: "Have you" go together,

108
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,370
"Have I" go together; "Has she"...

109
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,050
So, if we have "she", this becomes "has".

110
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,570
"Has he...?"

111
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,749
If we have "he", this becomes "has".

112
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,749
Okay?

113
00:07:30,749 --> 00:07:37,659
And so, what do we answer if somebody asks
us a question about the present perfect or

114
00:07:37,659 --> 00:07:39,180
in the present perfect?

115
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,729
If somebody asks you: "Have you ever...?

116
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:48,479
Have you ever ridden a motorcycle?"

117
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:56,279
Your answer might be yes, and if your answer
is yes, you can say: "Yes, I have."

118
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:01,559
If your answer is no, you can say: "No, I
haven't."

119
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:05,849
So these are the simplest ways to answer present perfect questions.

120
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:06,979
There's other ways as well.

121
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:16,610
You can also say: "Yes, I've ridden a motorcycle
before" or "No, I've never ridden a motorcycle".

122
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:23,189
So, if you want the short form: "I have" or
"I haven't"; and if you want the longer form:

123
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:31,580
"I have ridden a motorcycle before" or "I've
never ridden a motorcycle before".

124
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,789
Okay?

125
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:34,760
So we've covered a lot of grammar.

126
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,530
Thank you for listening to the grammar explanation.

127
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:41,570
And now we are going to do something really fun.

128
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,120
We're going to play one of my favourite games
to practice the present perfect.

129
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,050
Okay, so now it is time to introduce our special guest.

130
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:53,720
Come on out, Audra.

131
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,200
So, this is my sister Audra.

132
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,680
Can you tell who's the younger one and who's
the older one?

133
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,880
Well, that's a surprise.

134
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,640
We're not going to say who's older.

135
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,490
So, Audra, the reason I've invited you here
is because I want you to play a game with

136
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,490
our audience.

137
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,490
Okay?

138
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,480
So you are going to play a game about the
present perfect with my sister Audra.

139
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,910
So, let me tell you the rules of the game.

140
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,910
Okay?

141
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,600
And I'll tell Audra the rules as well.

142
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
Audra: Thank you.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Emma: Okay.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,470
So, the rules are: We are going to talk about
experiences we've done, so I am going to ask

145
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,720
you and I am going to ask Audra questions
using the present perfect.

146
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,079
My question is going to be: Have you ever...?

147
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:48,590
So, for example: Have you ever had a pet dog?

148
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,460
Or: Have you ever played baseball?

149
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,900
Audra is going to answer yes or no.

150
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,839
Now, here's where the game gets interesting.

151
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,839
Audra...

152
00:09:58,839 --> 00:09:59,839
Audra: Yes.

153
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,839
Emma: Can I see your hands?

154
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,690
I want you to put your hands up, like this.

155
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,420
So, we see Audra's 10 fingers.

156
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:11,990
So, when Audra has done something, she's going
to put a finger down.

157
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,580
If you have done the same thing, you are going
to put a finger down.

158
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,580
Okay?

159
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,190
So, let's practice this first before we begin.

160
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,190
So, Audra...

161
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,190
Audra: Yes.

162
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,120
Emma: Have you ever eaten Italian food?

163
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,070
Audra: Yes, I have.

164
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,610
Emma: So notice Audra's finger goes down because
it's something she has done.

165
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,760
If you have eaten Italian food, you can put
a finger down as well-okay?-when we actually

166
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,890
play the game.

167
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,540
So, that's rule number one.

168
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,370
We have our 10 fingers out, and whenever we've
done something we put a finger down.

169
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,519
Now, what is the point of the game?

170
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,759
Oh, sorry.

171
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,170
What if we haven't done something?

172
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:54,370
So, Audra, have you ever had a pet together?

173
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,079
Audra: No, I've never had a pet tiger.

174
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:58,930
Emma: Notice Audra's hands?

175
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,550
None of the fingers go down.

176
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,550
Okay?

177
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,290
Now, how do you win the game?

178
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,470
Okay?

179
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,760
The way you win the game is I'm going to ask
Audra these questions, her fingers are going

180
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,910
to keep going down - when she has no fingers
left, if you still have fingers up, even one

181
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,110
finger, you win.

182
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,140
Okay?

183
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:28,580
If you have no fingers up and Audra has some
up, she wins.

184
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
Okay?

185
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:37,529
So, again, just summary of the rules because
that's a lot of information: If Audra's done

186
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,120
something, then her finger goes down.

187
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,279
If she hasn't done something, her fingers
stay up; nothing happens.

188
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,630
At the end of the game, if your fingers are
up, you win.

189
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,089
If at the end of the game all your fingers
are down, you lose.

190
00:11:57,089 --> 00:11:58,089
Okay?

191
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,260
So let's get started.

192
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,940
All right.

193
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,569
Audra, have you ever been to South America?

194
00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:10,899
Audra: No, I've actually never been to South America.

195
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:11,899
Emma: Okay.

196
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:16,350
For our audience, if you've been to South
America, you can put your finger down.

197
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,420
Audra, have you ever fallen in love?

198
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,819
Audra: I can say yes, I have fallen in love.

199
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,180
Finger down.

200
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,540
Emma: Good.

201
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,079
Have you ever been on TV?

202
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,519
Audra: Does this count?

203
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,750
Because otherwise, no I have never been on TV.

204
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,380
Emma: Okay, so this doesn't count.

205
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,380
Audra: Okay.

206
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,380
Nothing happens.

207
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,380
Emma: Okay.

208
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,199
And if you have been on TV, you can put your
finger down.

209
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:47,310
Audra, have you ever gotten a tattoo?

210
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,650
Audra: Yes, I actually have several tattoos.

211
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,370
Emma: Okay, and I think I can see one right there.

212
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,829
Audra: That's correct.

213
00:12:54,829 --> 00:12:55,829
Emma: Okay.

214
00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:01,329
So, Audra put her finger down because she
has gotten a tattoo before.

215
00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,740
And if you've gotten a tattoo, your finger
should go down, too.

216
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,420
Audra, have you ever been to jail?

217
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,449
Audra: No, I have never been to jail.

218
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:14,449
Emma: Okay.

219
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:18,550
So, if our audience has been to jail, you
can put your finger down.

220
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:22,920
Hopefully you haven't, so your fingers will
stay up.

221
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,139
Have you ever met a famous person, Audra?

222
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:28,029
Audra: Yes, I have met a famous person.

223
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,490
I met Sandra Bullock.

224
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,590
Emma: Wow, I didn't know that.

225
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,910
All right.

226
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,750
So, if you've met a famous person, you can put your finger down, too.

227
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:42,089
Audra, have you ever dyed your hair black?

228
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,660
Audra: No, I've never dyed my hair black;
only blonde.

229
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,389
Emma: Okay.

230
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:50,389
Okay.

231
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,000
Have you ever...?

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,660
Have you ever been on YouTube?

233
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,129
Audra: No, I've never been on YouTube.

234
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,170
Emma: Except now.

235
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,170
Audra: Except now.

236
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,490
Emma: So we'll have her put her finger down for that.

237
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,139
Audra: Okay, finger down.

238
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:04,379
Emma: All right.

239
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:06,440
Have you ever gone fishing?

240
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,060
Audra: Yes, I have gone fishing.

241
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,050
I was not very good at it, but I did go.

242
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,050
Finger down.

243
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,050
Emma: Okay, good.

244
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:17,290
So, I want you to count how many fingers you have right now.

245
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,620
Audra still has give up, so hopefully you
still have fingers up.

246
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,620
Okay?

247
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,080
Because as soon as you have no fingers, you lose.

248
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,350
Audra, have you ever played golf?

249
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,540
Audra: Yes, I recently played golf.

250
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,450
Emma: Okay.

251
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,910
Have you ever ridden on a motorcycle?

252
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,629
Audra: Yes, I went out on a date 
and it was on a motorcycle.

253
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:45,760
Emma: Have you ever visited China?

254
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,449
Audra: Yes, last year I went and I visited
China.

255
00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:51,329
Emma: Okay, good.

256
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:52,329
Have you ever...?

257
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:55,140
Hmm, let's pick something.

258
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Have you...?

259
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,990
Have you ever cheated on a test?

260
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,959
Oh, moment of truth.

261
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:07,550
Audra: Yes, I think I might have, when I was
younger, cheated on a test.

262
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,110
Emma: Okay.

263
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,620
So, Audra has one finger up, so this is...

264
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,980
This might be the question to determine: Who's
the winner of the game?

265
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,540
Audra: The moment of truth.

266
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,370
Emma: Audra, have you ever been in a fist fight?

267
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,580
Audra: No, I've never been in a fist fight.

268
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,360
Emma: Have you ever had a moustache?

269
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,860
Audra: No, I've never had a moustache.

270
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,320
Emma: Have you...?

271
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,529
Have you ever eaten an octopus or a squid?

272
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:37,529
Audra: No.

273
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:41,500
I'm vegetarian; I've never eaten an octopus or a squid.

274
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,379
Emma: Have you ever smoked a cigar?

275
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:47,709
Audra: Yes, I have smoked a cigar.

276
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:49,420
Emma: And there you have it.

277
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,069
So, count how many fingers you have.

278
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:56,759
If you have no fingers, that means you lose.

279
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,670
But if you have a couple of fingers or even
one finger left, you win.

280
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:07,040
So, what I want you to do is I want you to
write in the comment section if you have won

281
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,319
the game or if you've lost the game.

282
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:10,319
Okay?

283
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,680
Do you have...?

284
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,980
Have you experienced these things in the past?

285
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,120
So you can explain what you've done in the
past and you can just say if you've won or

286
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
you lost.

287
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:27,079
All right, so I want to thank my sister Audra
for being here today; she did a wonderful

288
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:28,079
job, so well done.

289
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,740
It's her first time on YouTube and on engVid.

290
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,520
And I just wanted to let our audience know
that we have a quiz where you can practice

291
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,310
the things we've talked about today.

292
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:46,629
So, you can visit our website at www.engvid.com,
and there you'll find our quiz where you can

293
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:51,860
practice the present perfect, especially asking
present perfect questions, like we've done

294
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
today.

295
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,379
I also think this is a great game to practice
the present perfect.

296
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:00,629
We were doing this with fingers.

297
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:03,640
Some people like to do this at the bar, doing
shots.

298
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:11,760
Now, I wouldn't recommend that, but maybe
Audra would, so it can be a fun game to do

299
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,210
either with fingers or with drinks if you
drink, so it's your choice.

300
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,430
But it is a really good way to practice.

301
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,260
I also would like to invite you to subscribe
to my channel; there, you can find a lot of

302
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:29,230
other different resources on similar topics,
including grammar, as well as many other things.

303
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,700
So, thank you for watching; and until next
time, take care.

304
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
High-five, Audra.

305
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Audra: Yeah.

306
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,799
Emma: Well done.
