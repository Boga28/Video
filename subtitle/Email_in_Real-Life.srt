Hey, Tyler. You going to that all day meeting tomorrow?

I'll be on vacation from Tuesday, June 27th until 2 days ago.

3
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:10,814
Um, your auto-response is still on.

00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:26,888
Okay, everyone, I need you to send me your reports ASAP, before lunch if possible.

7
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:27,928
Will do, Tripp.

8
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:29,815

9
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:31,360
Will do, Tripp.

11
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:36,218

Be there around 7 tonight, if that's okay?

13
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,281
Yeah, sounds good.

16
00:01:04,427 --> 00:01:07,490
Here's that report you needed.

17
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:11,225
I don't see anything.

18
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:15,017
Oh, dang it. I forgot to attach it.

19
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:17,557
Hey, Beth, did you see all of the submissions we got today?

20
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:19,141
OMG, I KNOW!

21
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,678
Easy on the all caps.

22
00:01:20,678 --> 00:01:21,455
Sorry.

23
00:01:21,455 --> 00:01:24,148
It's okay. Semi-colon. Closed parentheses.

24
00:01:24,148 --> 00:01:31,841
Hey, son. You have to watch this video of this cat sleeping on a horse. It is so cute!

25
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,214
Mom, I'm at work!

26
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:40,603
Dear friend, I am Johnson Emmanuel. This might come to you as a surprise. I am the next heir to the throne in

27
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:43,614
Nigeria and I want to offer you a large sum of money.

28
00:01:43,614 --> 00:01:44,825
Please stop coming here.

29
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:49,285
Hi, Tripp. Are you satisfied with-

30
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:57,174
Hi. I'm the administrator. I cannot deliver this document. It was too big. On Monday at 10:37am, Paul

00:01:57,174 --> 00:02:01,110

32

Paul."

33
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:03,043
Yeah, I know what I wrote.

34
00:02:03,043 --> 00:02:09,731
Hey, really looking forward to seeing you guys tonight. Oh yeah, circular disclosure: this information

I don't know what that means.

Inbox full.

39
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,771
Hey, what's this poker game I hear about this weekend?

40
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:33,815
Who's that guy?

41
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:35,389
You need me to bring anything, or-

42
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:40,728
I meant to invite a different David. Raincheck?

43
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:46,545
Email can be frustrating, but that's probably because you're trying to use it for the wrong things, like

44
00:02:46,545 --> 00:02:51,433
status reporting or approval tracking. If you're looking for a smarter way to manage work, consider using

45
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:54,861
WorkFront, a much better than email approach to work management.
