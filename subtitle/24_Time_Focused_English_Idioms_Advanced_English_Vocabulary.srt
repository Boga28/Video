00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,721
Recently,

2
00:00:00,721 --> 00:00:05,460
one of my students told me that I haven't
done a lesson on English idioms in

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,500
ages and she's right.

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,910
I haven't done a lesson dedicated
to English idioms for quite a while.

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,020
Like my students,

6
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:17,280
you might love incorporating English
idioms into your conversation,

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,290
sprinkling idioms into your speech here
and there (the way that you sprinkle

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,120
salt on food) is a wonderful way to
bring interest in creativity to your

9
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:30,780
speech. It makes our
language more dynamic.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,650
And that's exactly what I want to
help you do with this lesson today.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,550
If you're joining me for the very first
time I'm Annemarie with Speak Confident

12
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:40,194
English,

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,490
everything I do here is designed to help
you with the confidence you want for

14
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:48,480
your life and work in English in
this Confident English lesson today,

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:53,460
I hope that you'll join me to
learn and add 24 new English

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,800
idioms to your active vocabulary.

17
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,780
All of these idioms are
focused on the concept of time,

18
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,830
whether you want to express that
something happened right on time,

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,450
that you don't have enough
time, or you have too much time.

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,480
Be sure to stick with me
all the way to the end,

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,330
because I do have a practice
opportunity for you.

22
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,770
I want to make sure that you absolutely
understand what these idioms mean

23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,360
and how to naturally use them
in your English conversations.

24
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,813
[Inaudible].

25
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,520
Let's start with our first four idioms,

26
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,530
all of which help us express that
something happened at just the right time.

27
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,500
It wasn't too early
and it wasn't too late.

28
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,180
The first one is in the
nick of time. For example,

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,370
we were stuck in traffic,

30
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,300
but we arrived at the airport
just in the nick of time.

31
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,460
We use this idiom to express that
something happened just at the last

32
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,490
possible moment before it was too late.

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,810
If we had arrived any
later at the airport,

34
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,460
we may have missed our flight. So
we arrived in the nick of time.

35
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:09,870
Similar to that,

36
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:14,340
we can also describe something
as happening at the 11th hour.

37
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,361
Again,

38
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:20,220
this idiom tells us that something
happened just at the last possible

39
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:23,730
moment before it was
too late. For example,

40
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,760
just when we thought we were
going to miss the deadline.

41
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,040
Carol finished her editing and we
submitted the proposal at the 11th hour.

42
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,360
Our third idiom in this
category is it's high time.

43
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,650
For example,

44
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:42,630
it's high time that we consider moving
out of our apartment and into a house.

45
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,880
This idiomatic phrase expresses
that it's about time that we finally

46
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:48,714
do something.

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,940
Maybe someone has been waiting for a
very long period of time and they are

48
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,830
finally ready. It is about
time now is the right time.

49
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,213
It's high time.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,750
And our final idiom in this
category is in good time

51
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,120
and good time expresses that
something will happen when it's

52
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,120
supposed to happen. For example,

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,010
when I was worried about whether I
would ever find a job, I really wanted,

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,300
my mom said all things
happen in good time.

55
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,470
And now let's move on to our
second category of idioms.

56
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:30,370
All of which are focused on
different points of time.

57
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,600
For example, eons ago or ages ago,

58
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,460
English speakers love this phrase to
express that something happened a while

59
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:40,840
ago. In fact,

60
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,580
it emphasizes that something
occurred a long time ago.

61
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,100
Just like the example I
shared at the beginning,

62
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:52,660
when my students said you haven't
done a lesson on idioms for

63
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,430
ages, in other words, for a
really, really, really long time.

64
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,740
Another example, I finished that
book eons ago. In other words,

65
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,120
months ago or years ago,
an idiomatic expression.

66
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,590
That means the opposite. That means
that something will occur in the future,

67
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,760
but not for quite a while is a ways out.

68
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,870
For example,

69
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,009
let's say that it's January and you've
already started to plan your summer

70
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:25,660
vacation. You have everything ready to
go in a conversation. You might say,

71
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,540
I know that summer is a ways out,

72
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,960
but you can never start
planning your vacation too soon.

73
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,390
Another great idiomatic expression to
use with a future focus is in the long

74
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:40,060
run. When we use this in a sentence,

75
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:44,860
we're expressing that something
will more fully develop over time.

76
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,300
For example,

77
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,430
we should start saving money now so
that we don't have to worry about our

78
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,770
financial security in the long run.

79
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,920
The next idiom on our list
is one of my favorites.

80
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:01,090
When I get up particularly early
for a flight or to work out

81
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,020
at the crack of dawn, for example,

82
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,820
I was so excited about my new job that
I woke up at the crack of dawn today.

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,830
This phrase refers to that moment when
we first start to see the sunlight on the

84
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:15,664
horizon,

85
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,950
and we use this expression to talk
about things that happen super early

86
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:21,784
in the morning.

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:26,770
And now our final idiom for talking
about different points of time is a

88
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:28,240
moment of truth.

89
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,640
And we love to use this idiom to talk
about a present moment when something

90
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:34,990
will be revealed.

91
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,730
Maybe we've been waiting and
waiting and waiting to find out some

92
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,630
information.

93
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,850
And when it is time for that
information to be revealed,

94
00:05:45,851 --> 00:05:49,270
we can say, it's the moment
of truth. For example,

95
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:52,390
if you have a child
applying to universities,

96
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,770
you might be waiting and waiting and
waiting to get news in the mail on whether

97
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,620
or not your child was
accepted into that university.

98
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,660
So when that letter finally arrives
and your son or daughter starts to

99
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,250
open that envelope,

100
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,670
it is most certainly that moment of truth.

101
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,750
When you will find out whether or not
your daughter or son was accepted into

102
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:19,160
that university. And now it's
time for our next six idioms,

103
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,360
all of which are focused on
expressing a lack of time

104
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,771
in the past,

105
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:29,150
I've done lessons on time management
and trying to create better

106
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,710
life work balance.

107
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:34,880
So some of these idiomatic
expressions may be familiar to you.

108
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,860
The first one on our list in this
category is to be pressed for

109
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:40,694
time.

110
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,440
And we use this to let others know
that we don't have very much time.

111
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:46,910
For example,

112
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,470
we were pressed for time and had to
finish dinner early so we could make it to

113
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:55,160
the theater. The second one in
this category is running late.

114
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,050
You've probably heard this one before,

115
00:06:57,051 --> 00:07:02,000
because it's extremely common when
we know we are going to be late,

116
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,000
or we already are late for something,

117
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,370
a very common way to use this is
to let others know that you are

118
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:14,240
running late. So you may not
be at the meeting on time.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,050
You might call your coworker and
say, go ahead and start the meeting.

120
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,060
I'm running five minutes late when
you are unable to complete something

121
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,580
because you no longer have time.

122
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,930
You can use the expression
to run out of time.

123
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,460
For example, before I knew it, the test
was over and I had run out of time.

124
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,470
When we use that expression,

125
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,910
we're indicating that we were
not able to finish the task

126
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,400
time, ran out the deadline passed,

127
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,350
and we were unable to succeed in
our task. We didn't finish it fully.

128
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,760
We ran out of time. And of
course in those moments,

129
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,140
when you know the clock is ticking,
you see time going forward.

130
00:07:57,141 --> 00:08:01,430
And you know that you're going to have
a really hard time completing the task.

131
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,680
We can say that you're in a race
against the clock or in a race

132
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,550
against time. For example,
during the holiday season,

133
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,140
everyone raises against the clock to get
their shopping done before the stores

134
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:19,460
close. And sometimes when
we're racing against the clock,

135
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,620
we might try to do something that's kind
of cheating or trying to get ahead in a

136
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:27,740
way to beat the clock. In other words,

137
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:32,060
you want to make sure that you finish
your task before you run out of time.

138
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,409
For example,

139
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,390
Sam tried to beat the clock as he scarfed
down his breakfast and ran out the

140
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,799
door. Let's pause here for a
moment. What do you think? I mean,

141
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,320
by scarfed down his breakfast,

142
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,470
if someone is trying to beat the clock,

143
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,760
they're trying to do something before
it's too late and they're running for the

144
00:08:52,761 --> 00:08:54,920
door to get to work on time.

145
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,050
How do you think they ate their breakfast?

146
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,390
Where are they eating in a calm,
super polite, formal manner?

147
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,520
Definitely not to scarf
something down means to eat it

148
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:12,750
extremely quickly. And
during that process,

149
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:15,870
you've probably lost all
your table manners as well.

150
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,360
And now our last idiom for expressing
a lack of time is certainly one

151
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:25,320
that, you know, I hear my students
use it often. Time is money,

152
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,940
as I'm sure you know,

153
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:31,830
this idiom is used to express that time
is precious and we certainly should not

154
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:33,840
waste it. For example,

155
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:38,490
my husband never sits down for a moment
to relax because he believes time is

156
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,324
money.

157
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,280
Every moment he is working on
something or trying to work toward a

158
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:47,520
specific goal or to complete
a project. All right,

159
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:51,990
so far we've had a variety of idioms that
can be used to express that something

160
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,970
happened right on time,

161
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,580
that we had a lack of time and to
express different points in time.

162
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,240
So now let's move on to our
fourth category with idioms,

163
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:08,160
we use to talk about having
excess time or too much time.

164
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,870
When you go on vacation,

165
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,790
you probably would love to
say that you have all the time

166
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:19,560
in the world. When we have all the time
in the world, there's plenty of time.

167
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:21,690
There's no rush. There's no panic.

168
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,020
We don't have to worry about
any upcoming deadlines.

169
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,540
That is definitely something we all
want when we're going away on vacation.

170
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,760
Another example might be, we have all
the time in the world to binge watch.

171
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,530
Netflix shows this weekend,

172
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,510
similar to all the time in the world
is to have a lot of time on your

173
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,250
hands. Again,

174
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:48,240
this is used to express that
you have plenty of time.

175
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,870
For example, Sandra has a
lot of time on her hands.

176
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:55,560
Now that our kids are at school
with this particular idiom,

177
00:10:55,561 --> 00:11:00,480
we can also use it in the negative
sense to indicate that we don't have

178
00:11:00,481 --> 00:11:03,630
time, that we have a lack
of time. For example,

179
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,410
now that I'm going back to work
and at the office full time,

180
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:12,390
I don't have a lot of time on my
hands to watch Netflix when you have

181
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:14,250
too much time on your hands.

182
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,180
And you're not really sure
how to fill up all that time,

183
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,450
you might start looking
for different things to do,

184
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:25,770
to occupy yourself or to
kill time. For example,

185
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:30,510
if you're traveling, you might have
a six hour layover in an airport.

186
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:35,370
So you might say that you want to find
a really good book to read while you're

187
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:36,930
at the airport to kill time.

188
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,680
And if that book is particularly good,

189
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,880
you might lose track of time.
When we lose track of time,

190
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:49,500
we don't even notice that time has
passed. Maybe before your flight,

191
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,200
you were really dreading
that six hour layover,

192
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:56,590
but then you found that fantastic
book you started reading.

193
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,980
And before you knew it, it
was time for your next flight.

194
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:02,470
You lost track of time
while you were reading.

195
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:06,040
Now let's say that maybe
you've lost track of time,

196
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,900
or you've missed out on opportunities
because you were way too busy

197
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,360
as a way to apologize to someone
else and to show that you

198
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:20,950
value their time. You might
want to make up for lost time.

199
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,360
For example,

200
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,100
both of Julian's parents
have been particularly busy
with work and approaching

201
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:30,700
deadlines. So to make up for lost time,

202
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,620
they dedicated their entire weekend
to spending time together as a family.

203
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,750
And now our last idiom in
this category is to live on

204
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:42,100
borrowed time.

205
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:47,440
We use this to express that someone
is living or surviving beyond

206
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,160
their expected amount
of time. For example,

207
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,020
after surviving cancer,

208
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,470
Karen felt that she was
living on borrowed time.

209
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,910
And now we have our final
three time focus, idioms,

210
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,200
all of which can be used to
express a lack of frequency.

211
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,360
For example, if you want to say
that something rarely happens,

212
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,610
you can say that it happens once
in a blue moon. For example,

213
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,780
we see our extended family
once in a blue moon,

214
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,630
and usually only at family reunions,

215
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:27,550
similar to once in a blue
moon is every now and then if

216
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:32,350
something happens every now
and then it's a little more

217
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:36,580
often than once in a blue
moon, rather than the adverb.

218
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,170
Rarely we might think of the
adverbs sometimes, for example,

219
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:46,120
every now and then Hollywood produces
a movie that impacts an entire

220
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:46,960
generation.

221
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,940
And now our final idiom on the
list for today is every so often.

222
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,240
For example, I don't
really have a sweet tooth,

223
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,830
but every so often I crave
a piece of chocolate.

224
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,300
And with that, you have
24 new English, idioms,

225
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,160
all of which are focused on time
to add to your active vocabulary.

226
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,830
Now, when I say active vocabulary,

227
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,930
I mean idioms that you can think of
and use instantly in a conversation

228
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:21,550
to make sure that these idioms are
part of your active vocabulary.

229
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:25,450
You need to of course learn
them and then practice them.

230
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:28,360
You need consistent repetitive practice.

231
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:32,110
So I've got a couple of
questions for you. Number one,

232
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,680
which idiom on the list today
was your absolute favorite.

233
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,250
Which one did you hear and think,
oh my gosh, I love that idiom.

234
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,700
If there was one, you
really enjoyed learning.

235
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,240
I want you to practice using it
in your own example sentence,

236
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,950
and you can share your example with me
in the comments below my second question.

237
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,310
You is a little more in depth. I want
you to think about your last week,

238
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,640
everything that you've done, the
things that happened right on time,

239
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:02,630
the things that you didn't have enough
time for moments when you felt like you

240
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:06,230
had too much time, think
about your past week,

241
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,810
choose three idioms from
this lesson today and use

242
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:14,630
those idioms to describe your week. Again,

243
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,820
you can share in the
comments with me below.

244
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,570
If you found this lesson useful
to you, I would love to know.

245
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:23,060
And you can tell me in
one very simple way,

246
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,870
