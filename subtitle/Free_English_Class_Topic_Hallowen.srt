1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,826
Well hello and welcome to this
English lesson about Halloween.

2
00:00:03,826 --> 00:00:07,426
For those of you that don't
know what Halloween is it's a

3
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:11,346
tradition. It's an event. It's
not really a celebration. I

4
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:14,386
guess you could call it that.
It's something that happens at

5
00:00:14,386 --> 00:00:17,906
the end of October every year.
And it involves candy and

6
00:00:17,906 --> 00:00:20,466
costumes and a lot of other
things which I will be

7
00:00:20,466 --> 00:00:25,026
explaining in this lesson. Uh
Halloween for me as a child was

8
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:29,026
a very enjoyable time. Because
my parents would take me out

9
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:32,846
for Halloween I would get dressed up and
we would go to all of the

10
00:00:32,846 --> 00:00:36,286
neighbour's houses and we would
get lots of candy. Sometimes we

11
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:40,286
would even get pop like soda.
Uh and one of our neighbours

12
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:43,326
even gave us money at
Halloween. So that was kind of

13
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:46,606
cool. But if you don't know
what Halloween is it's coming

14
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:49,886
up this weekend. Stick around
for this lesson and I will

15
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:53,246
explain all of the aspects of
Halloween to you. That you need

16
00:00:53,246 --> 00:00:55,966
to know to have a good
conversation about it in

17
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:59,706
English. Or at the very least
to understand and other people

18
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:04,266
when they talk about Halloween.
So as you can see here most

19
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:07,866
graphics or images that you
find for Halloween. They'll

20
00:01:07,866 --> 00:01:11,066
have things like skulls and
bats and spiders and witches

21
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:14,666
hats and jack-o-lanterns which
I'll talk about later. But

22
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:18,186
they're not images of fun
things. Which is kind of

23
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:21,466
strange because Halloween is
something that happens once a

24
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:25,226
year. And generally it's
something that is fun.

25
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:30,426
Halloween happens on October
31st. It's in a couple of days.

26
00:01:30,426 --> 00:01:34,626
And on that day Uh it's usually
fairly cool weather in our

27
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:39,266
area. But in spite of the cold
kids will go out and they will

28
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:43,186
go from house to house. They
will go from door to door. And

29
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,466
they'll ring the doorbell or
they'll knock and then they'll

30
00:01:46,466 --> 00:01:51,506
say trick or treat. Now I think
a long time ago trick or treat

31
00:01:51,506 --> 00:01:55,906
meant either give me a treat.
Give me some candy or I will

32
00:01:55,906 --> 00:01:59,346
play a trick on you. But it's
not very often that kids

33
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:03,566
actually play tricks on people
at Halloween. Ninety-nine point

34
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:07,166
percent of the time kids say
trick or treat and the person

35
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:11,406
at the house they are at will
give them some kind of candy or

36
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:15,486
chocolate so trick or treat I'm
going to talk about this on two

37
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:20,286
slides because trick or treat
is what kids say. So they ring

38
00:02:20,286 --> 00:02:23,966
the doorbell ding dong. When
the door opens they hold out

39
00:02:23,966 --> 00:02:27,486
their Halloween bag and they
say trick or treat and then the

40
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:32,446
person usually gives them some
kind of candy. We also use it

41
00:02:32,446 --> 00:02:35,326
as a verb though. So you can
say that you're going to go

42
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:39,006
trick or treating. Okay well
not exactly a verb but you can

43
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,366
say you are going to
participate in the act of trick

44
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:46,526
or treating. So someone at work
yesterday just said are you

45
00:02:46,526 --> 00:02:50,126
taking your kids out to go
trick or treating this weekend?

46
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:56,286
And I responded by saying no my
youngest kid is too old for to

47
00:02:56,286 --> 00:03:01,246
go trick or treating. Usually
in our family once our kids are

48
00:03:01,246 --> 00:03:04,846
about 12 years old they don't
go out trick or treating

49
00:03:04,846 --> 00:03:08,446
anymore. We don't take them out
trick or treating. Um just so

50
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:12,506
you know with little kids
parents usually go with when

51
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:15,946
they go trick or treating. And
when they're around age 12 or

52
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,706
13 they might go with a group
of friends trick or treating.

53
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:24,266
Um but our kids are too old to
go trick or treating. But we

54
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:28,666
will be home. I'll show you
something in a sec. We will be

55
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,866
home on that evening and we
will of course be handing out

56
00:03:31,866 --> 00:03:39,106
candy. Um usually kids will
dress up in a costume. So they

57
00:03:39,106 --> 00:03:43,666
will decide what they want to
be for Halloween. Okay. They'll

58
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,186
decide how they want to dress
up for Halloween. So a common

59
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,306
question will be this. What are
you gonna be for Halloween? And

60
00:03:50,306 --> 00:03:54,466
that means what costume are you
going to wear? What character

61
00:03:54,466 --> 00:04:00,546
or what are you going to dress
up as? When I was a kid you

62
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:05,066
could either be a cow, a
pirate, a cowboy, or a

63
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:07,706
princess. I think we only
really had four Halloween

64
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:12,586
costumes at our house and so
you would choose one of those

65
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,426
when you went out. Of course I
used the verb to dress up

66
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:20,986
already. Um either you say I'm
going to be Mario for

67
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:24,666
Halloween. I'm going to wear a
Mario costume for Halloween. Or

68
00:04:24,666 --> 00:04:28,906
I'm going to dress up as Mario
for Halloween. A few different

69
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:34,186
ways to talk about how you are
going to dress up in order to

70
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:39,226
go out for Halloween. And maybe
you'll wear a mask. You could

71
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:42,906
see this kid has a little mask
on. Um she has a mask that has

72
00:04:42,906 --> 00:04:45,786
a little it looks like a little
beak. Maybe she's trying to

73
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:51,386
pretend to be a bird. Um so you
cannot only dress up as people.

74
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:54,506
You can dress up as animals as
well. As you might have heard

75
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:58,906
when I said I would dress up as
a cow sometimes for Halloween.

76
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:02,346
I think my mom actually made
the cow costume. I should ask

77
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:05,146
her about it today. I'm going
to see my mom tonight. I should

78
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:08,586
ask her about the cow costume.
We'll probably have a good

79
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:14,266
laugh about it. Some of the
most popular costumes at

80
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:18,506
Halloween the probably the most
popular costume is to dress up

81
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:22,746
as a superhero. When I give out
candy this weekend I will

82
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:26,426
probably see a few Batmans,
some Supermans, some Wonder

83
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:32,666
Woman's probably a few Black
Widows probably Iron Man

84
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:36,666
Captain America. All of the
superheroes that you see in

85
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:42,046
movies usually show up at your
door but usually a lot because

86
00:05:42,046 --> 00:05:46,046
they're kids. Um so you will
see a lot of superheroes. I

87
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:50,366
think Batman is probably one of
the most popular ones. Although

88
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:53,806
last year I did see a lot of
kids dressed up as Iron Man as

89
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:59,726
well. Um another common costume
is to be a pirate. If you're

90
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,806
not sure what a pirate is a
pirate is someone from a long

91
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:07,646
time ago who would sail around
on a boat and attack other

92
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:11,886
boats and steal all of their
gold and other things that were

93
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:17,426
valuable. Uh so for some this
has survived as a as a

94
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:21,026
Halloween costume quite often.
Uh I think because it's simple

95
00:06:21,026 --> 00:06:24,626
if you wear a white poofy shirt
and a hat and find a plastic

96
00:06:24,626 --> 00:06:27,746
sword you're basically a
pirate. So it's a simple

97
00:06:27,746 --> 00:06:31,986
costume for parents to put
together for their kids to

98
00:06:31,986 --> 00:06:36,866
wear. Uh sometimes you just
dress up as normal people. Kids

99
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:39,906
will dress up as construction
workers. Uh they'll dress up

100
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:42,866
well I was gonna say as
teachers but I've never seen

101
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:45,786
that happen. Um but kids will
dress up as construction

102
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:50,986
workers. They will dress up as
firefighters. Um I think I have

103
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:57,226
one here. They will dress up as
regular jobs as well. Um as I

104
00:06:57,226 --> 00:07:00,826
mentioned one of the costumes
we had as a kid was a princess

105
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:04,506
costume. I think my mom found a
dress somewhere and so my

106
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:08,506
sister sometimes would go as a
princess. Still a very very

107
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:14,586
common costume at Halloween to
see kids come as a princess. Oh

108
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:18,346
and I I went the wrong way. Um
sometimes kids dress up as a

109
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:21,946
mummy. Although this costume
doesn't always survive the

110
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:26,426
evening. A mummy is someone
yeah well I don't know if

111
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,986
you've ever watched a movie
with mummies in it. Uh

112
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:32,746
mummification is something they
do to people after they pass

113
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:36,746
away thousands of years ago in
Egypt. Um and they would put

114
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,146
them in the pyramids but
mummies have lots of white

115
00:07:39,146 --> 00:07:44,906
strips of cloth around them. So
it becomes kind of I guess a

116
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:48,766
relative easy costume although
most of the time when someone

117
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:53,086
dresses up as a mummy the the
the cloth starts to fall off as

118
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:58,446
the evening goes by and then we
said firefighter another very

119
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:04,926
common costume is to dress up
as a ghost I think this is a

120
00:08:04,926 --> 00:08:08,766
common costume as well sorry
I'm not ignoring you I'm just

121
00:08:08,766 --> 00:08:13,326
pulling up my slides over here
for a second cuz I need to kind

122
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:17,166
of follow along where did they
go

123
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:22,106
I can't. I the alphabet's not
working for me in my brain

124
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:24,746
right now. I'll find them
later. Uh a ghost is a very

125
00:08:24,746 --> 00:08:28,826
common costume because all you
need is an old white sheet and

126
00:08:28,826 --> 00:08:32,905
you cut a few holes in it and
voila that's a French word but

127
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:36,105
we use it in English too.
Voila. You have a a Halloween

128
00:08:36,106 --> 00:08:40,586
costume. So you will often see
one or two ghosts. Um really

129
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:44,826
short ghosts. Uh during the
Halloween season or on the

130
00:08:44,826 --> 00:08:48,986
evening of Halloween. Sometimes
people dress up as witches. So

131
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:53,266
a witch is a character who
maybe If you read books you'll

132
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,466
read about witches. I think
there's witches in Macbeth if

133
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:59,826
you ever read Shakespeare.
Witches sometimes make potions

134
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:03,186
and they do magic and sometimes
they're considered to be bad

135
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:07,826
people. But there are things
like yeah I'm trying to think

136
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:12,066
here. There is a good witch
isn't there? Uh in why can't I

137
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:14,706
remember the name? Maybe
someone could tell me what

138
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:17,986
movie The Good Witch is. Oh The
Wizard of Oz. There's a good

139
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:24,446
witch. Um so a witch is kind of
a evil woman. Uh that but not

140
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:27,886
always. Sometimes they're good.
Yeah. But sometimes people

141
00:09:27,886 --> 00:09:30,766
dress up as witches. I'm not
explaining this one very well.

142
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:33,726
You should look at the spelling
of witch though. We have a few

143
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:41,786
spellings of the word witch in
in English. Excuse me. I'm not

144
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:46,106
quite sure what that was. But
this is the scariest picture I

145
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:50,266
have in the slideshow. These
are zombies. Zombies sometimes

146
00:09:50,266 --> 00:09:53,706
people dress up as zombies.
It's become a lot more popular

147
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:59,066
in the last 15 or 20 years. I
think zombie movies have become

148
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:03,466
very popular. A zombie is
someone who has well they're a

149
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:07,786
a fictional character who has
died and come back to life. So

150
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:12,386
sometimes people will dress up
as a zombie. I'm not a big of

151
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:15,426
dressing up in ways that scare
people like that. But you

152
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:19,346
probably have watched movies
with zombies. And if you go out

153
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:21,906
for Halloween you will
definitely see one or two kids

154
00:10:21,906 --> 00:10:26,306
dressed up as zombies. It does
happen. What do you get at

155
00:10:26,306 --> 00:10:30,146
Halloween? You get candy or you
get chocolate bars or candy

156
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:33,986
bars. Um you go to a house you
ring the doorbell and then

157
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:38,946
someone comes. So we're ready
to go here. We have the this is

158
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:42,866
the box that we bought for
Halloween to hand out to kids.

159
00:10:42,866 --> 00:10:45,906
So you could see there are I
don't know how close I can put

160
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:50,886
this. Will it focus? Here we
go. So there are four different

161
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:54,566
kinds of chocolate bars in
here. In my part of Canada I

162
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:57,766
call these chocolate bars. In
some parts of the world they

163
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:02,326
would call them candy bars. We
usually don't hand out candy.

164
00:11:02,326 --> 00:11:05,286
We usually hand out chocolate
bars. I think because I like

165
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:08,086
chocolate bars. And so that's
what we hand out. These

166
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:12,086
chocolate bars are quite small.
So we usually should I open it?

167
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:15,366
If I open it well I start
eating them. I might start

168
00:11:15,366 --> 00:11:19,166
eating them if I open it. But
I'm gonna open it to show you

169
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:24,806
Jen said we can't open this
till actual Halloween. But you

170
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:29,126
can see let me get one of each
of these out. I'm not gonna eat

171
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:35,206
them. I promise. Uh you can see
that they're quite small. Um so

172
00:11:35,206 --> 00:11:39,766
we usually let kids this one
has a coffee flavour. It's kids

173
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:43,366
don't really like that one. Um
in Canada smarties are actually

174
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:46,166
a form of chocolate and then we
have Kit Kat which you might be

175
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:49,526
familiar. We usually let the
kids who come to our door. We

176
00:11:49,526 --> 00:11:54,166
usually let take about five or
six a small handful. Um we

177
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,286
don't actually have a lot of
kids come to our house for

178
00:11:57,286 --> 00:12:00,166
Halloween. So we usually give
out quite a bit of chocolate.

179
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:04,326
We would just refer to all of
these things as treats. So the

180
00:12:04,326 --> 00:12:07,846
candies, the chocolate, all of
it is simply called treats.

181
00:12:07,846 --> 00:12:10,726
Sometimes people hand out
licorice. They hand out small

182
00:12:10,726 --> 00:12:14,566
bags of potato chips. They hand
out chocolate. Um we would just

183
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:18,006
refer to all of them as treats.
And now you can see why kids

184
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:23,126
say trick or treat. Because
they get a treat. So I

185
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:26,326
mentioned when I was a kid that
one of our neighbors would give

186
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:29,606
us money. And that neighbour
still does give out money. We

187
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:33,046
have a neighbour who instead of
getting actually our kids would

188
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:36,006
get candy. They would get
chocolate and they would get a

189
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:40,566
loony which is $1 in Canada.
And I think the last time we

190
00:12:40,566 --> 00:12:42,806
went out a few years ago they
got a toonie from our

191
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:47,046
neighbours. So at some places
they will hand out money. It's

192
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:52,066
rare though. But it does happen
sometimes. Uh we also had a

193
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,786
neighbour that would give each
of our kids a can of pop. You

194
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:58,386
might call it soda in your part
of the world. Um my kids really

195
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:01,346
liked going to that neighbour
because they liked getting a

196
00:13:01,346 --> 00:13:06,946
can of pop for Halloween. Um
and it was yeah. That's not a

197
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:11,826
common thing to get. Most kids
if you go trick or treating in

198
00:13:11,826 --> 00:13:16,706
a city if you go to a house you
will get one little chocolate

199
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:20,866
bar or one little candy. Okay.
That is the most common thing

200
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,906
to happen. But because I live
out in the country I think the

201
00:13:23,906 --> 00:13:28,066
treats were a little bigger and
better because people knew kid

202
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:31,426
weren't going to a lot of
different houses. Um when kids

203
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:35,106
go out for Halloween they will
take a bag with them. They will

204
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:38,626
have a bag to go trick or
treating. Um usually it's just

205
00:13:38,626 --> 00:13:42,866
any old bag. We would just use
reusable grocery bags. But

206
00:13:42,866 --> 00:13:46,866
sometimes kids will have an
actual bag that has you know a

207
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,746
jack-o-lantern on the side and
they'll take that out when they

208
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,426
go trick or treating. They'll
have a special bag when they go

209
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:56,786
out to get candy. Um but yeah
you do need a bag because

210
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:00,806
you're usually gonna end up
with almost half a bag of candy

211
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:04,886
depending on how long you go
out for and how many houses you

212
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:09,526
go to. So many people let me
get this a little bit bigger

213
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:13,446
for you. There we go. So I'm
not sure if you can see this

214
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:17,686
but some people will decorate
the outside of their house for

215
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:21,606
Halloween. We don't decorate
our house for Halloween.

216
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:25,046
Sometimes we'll have a couple
jack-o-lanterns out which I'll

217
00:14:25,046 --> 00:14:28,086
show you in a moment. Um but we
don't put up lights and we

218
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:32,346
don't put up scary things. But
some people to decorate their

219
00:14:32,346 --> 00:14:36,186
house for Halloween which means
they'll put out you know some

220
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:39,306
lights and pumpkins and some
other things which I'll talk

221
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:43,546
about to make their house look
a little bit spooky. So the

222
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:46,746
English word spooky means a
little bit scary or a little

223
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:51,866
bit frightening. People will
try to maybe they'll have a

224
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:55,546
little speaker outside playing
spooky sounds. Maybe they'll

225
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:58,826
have you know different things
on the front of their house

226
00:14:58,826 --> 00:15:01,226
like if you look in this
picture you can see there's

227
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:05,266
cobwebs and a candle and a
spider Jack will answer him.

228
00:15:05,266 --> 00:15:10,466
Let's talk about all of those
things. So pumpkins are the

229
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:13,826
most common thing to see
outside of someone's house for

230
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:19,666
two reasons. Uh one it's very
close to Thanksgiving right

231
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:23,266
now. Canadian Thanksgiving was
two weeks ago. American

232
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:27,586
Thanksgiving is about three
weeks after Halloween. So the

233
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:31,426
same some of the same
decorations that people put

234
00:15:31,426 --> 00:15:34,886
outside their house for
Halloween. Like pumpkins also

235
00:15:34,886 --> 00:15:38,246
work as decorations for
Thanksgiving which for

236
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:41,686
Americans is coming up in a few
weeks. None of the spooky

237
00:15:41,686 --> 00:15:45,286
decorations stay out for
Thanksgiving. But some people

238
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:48,406
might have bales of straw. They
might have pumpkins and other

239
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:53,126
things. So that it kinda works
for both holidays. But if you

240
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:57,206
need a pumpkin you will usually
make a trip to a pumpkin patch.

241
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:01,206
This is a very common fall
activity for people in North

242
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:04,806
America. You will go with your
family especially if you have

243
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:08,426
little kids. You will go with
your to a pumpkin patch and you

244
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:12,186
will pick out a pumpkin or two
and you will buy them and take

245
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:15,386
them back to your house and
maybe put them on your front

246
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:19,306
step or outside your front
door. I have not gone to a

247
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:23,466
pumpkin patch for a long time.
Um in fact I don't know if I've

248
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:27,306
ever gone to a pumpkin patch
with our kids. Now maybe once

249
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:32,106
off to ask Jen but I know a few
of my colleagues with little

250
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:36,106
kids are going to a pumpkin
patch tomorrow on Saturday to

251
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:40,566
pick out some pumpkins to
decorate their house. Uh and

252
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,006
what people will do is they
will make what's called a

253
00:16:44,006 --> 00:16:46,006
jack-o-lantern. A
jack-o-lantern is a pumpkin

254
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:50,166
where you remove everything
from the inside. You cut a hole

255
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,246
in the top and you take off
what's now like a lid and you

256
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:57,526
clean out the inside of the
pumpkin. All of the seeds and

257
00:16:57,526 --> 00:17:02,326
there's some you know gooey wet
insides that you take out and

258
00:17:02,326 --> 00:17:06,406
then you will carve a face in
the front or another design and

259
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:10,806
you will put a candle or a
flashlight or a little lantern

260
00:17:10,806 --> 00:17:15,445
lantern inside the and it's a
really cool it looks really

261
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:18,645
cool in the dark okay you can
see here let me make this

262
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:23,366
bigger you can see here that
the pumpkins glow orange so the

263
00:17:23,366 --> 00:17:27,286
light comes out the front many
people will do this as an

264
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:31,446
activity close to Halloween
with their kids they'll buy a

265
00:17:31,446 --> 00:17:34,086
pumpkin they'll make
jack-o-lanterns kids do this

266
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:39,806
often at school as an activity
in our area as well Um

267
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:43,646
sometimes people will put
spiders outside their house.

268
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,086
You can see there's a big
spider fake spider on this

269
00:17:47,086 --> 00:17:50,446
pillar. And this house in
particular. This is a pretty

270
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:54,446
standard front door for
someone's house close to

271
00:17:54,446 --> 00:17:57,566
Halloween. People will decorate
and it will look like that.

272
00:17:57,566 --> 00:18:01,566
Spiders are also scary and
spooky. Um all of the things

273
00:18:01,566 --> 00:18:05,806
that frighten people show up
around Halloween. Um and then

274
00:18:05,806 --> 00:18:09,806
people will put up fake spider
webs or what we sometimes call

275
00:18:09,806 --> 00:18:14,786
cobwebs. So spiderwebs cobwebs
are the little web that a

276
00:18:14,786 --> 00:18:18,706
spider will make in real life.
But people will actually buy

277
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:22,786
fake spiderwebs and put
spiderwebs up in the front of

278
00:18:22,786 --> 00:18:27,906
their house to make it look a
little more spooky as well. And

279
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,186
then interesting people will
often have some kind of

280
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:35,266
skeleton. This year in North
America a few people have

281
00:18:35,266 --> 00:18:39,426
bought really really tall
skeletons. They're like 12 feet

282
00:18:39,426 --> 00:18:43,506
tall so three metre tall. I
think that would be almost four

283
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:47,666
metres tall. I they scare me. I
don't like skeletons but people

284
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,786
will sometimes decorate the
front of their house with

285
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:54,626
skeletons. You can see now how
Halloween is a very weird

286
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:59,746
thing. Because it's about kids
dressing up and going out to

287
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:03,986
get candy. But it is also about
people trying to scare each

288
00:19:03,986 --> 00:19:08,226
other a little bit. So it's fun
for kids but it's also kind of

289
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:12,306
scary. Um it's kind of a it's a
weird it's a weird thing to

290
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:16,946
celebrate in my opinion. Um
people will often have like

291
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:20,226
little fake bats on the front
of their house. A bat is a

292
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:24,226
small animal that flies around
at night and eats insects. So

293
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:28,066
people will buy fake bats. You
understand the word fake I

294
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,706
think right? They go to a store
and they buy a bat that's made

295
00:19:30,706 --> 00:19:34,146
out of plastic. And they'll put
a few bats on the of their

296
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:38,786
house as decoration. And then
there's always some kind of

297
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:44,866
monsters somewhere I think this
might be Frankenstein. I'm not

298
00:19:44,866 --> 00:19:52,146
100% sure, But monsters are any
kind of you know imaginary

299
00:19:52,146 --> 00:19:56,786
being that is meant to scare
people. So sometimes people

300
00:19:56,786 --> 00:20:00,546
will have fake monsters at the
front of their house. Um just

301
00:20:00,546 --> 00:20:04,386
to give people a little bit of
a fright to scare people a

302
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:08,546
little bit. Um let me see. Oh
yes. Let's go one more. And

303
00:20:08,546 --> 00:20:12,226
sometimes people will put
tombstones or what we also

304
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:16,226
would call gravestones in their
yard. They'll actually have

305
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:20,306
fake ones and it'll say R I P
on it. Can you understand now

306
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:24,466
why I said this is a strange
thing Halloween. Because it's

307
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:27,906
it's about fun and kids go out
for candy and then people

308
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:31,506
decorate their houses to be
really scary. So it's kind of

309
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:35,746
weird. But a tombstone is where
after someone dies and they're

310
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:38,946
buried in a cemetery or a
graveyard. They'll put a

311
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:41,506
tombstone there with their
name. And so people will

312
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:45,906
sometimes put fake tombstones
on their front yard. And RIP

313
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:52,606
means rest in peace. So yeah
kind of a strange thing to do.

314
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:56,446
So someone asked what are the
three most common things to do

315
00:20:56,446 --> 00:20:59,406
on Halloween. So number one if
you're a kid you go out trick

316
00:20:59,406 --> 00:21:02,206
or treating and you get candy.
Number two if you're old you

317
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:05,646
probably stay home and hand out
candy. But number three if you

318
00:21:05,646 --> 00:21:09,966
are a teenager or someone in
your 20s maybe even in your

319
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:13,726
30s, you might go to a
Halloween party. Um these are

320
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:18,046
fairly common at universities.
Right now on the news last

321
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:22,906
night they said the police are
warning university students not

322
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,666
to have big Halloween parties.
Um so we have a few

323
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:30,666
universities close to us. Uh so
on the news they said the

324
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:33,546
police are concerned that the
Halloween parties this year

325
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:37,226
will be too big because of the
pandemic and COVID. Um so

326
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:40,906
generally those are the three
things you do. If you're a kid

327
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:43,306
you go out trick or treating
and you get candy. If you're

328
00:21:43,306 --> 00:21:46,666
old like me you hand out candy.
And if you're younger if you're

329
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,186
in your late teens or you're in
your 20s and you're young and

330
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:53,446
why in free, you might go to a
Halloween party, you might

331
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:56,726
dress up even though you're an
adult, you would wear a costume

332
00:21:56,726 --> 00:22:01,726
and go to a party. Um so
there's something called a

333
00:22:01,726 --> 00:22:07,486
haunted house. So a haunted
house is a house where you pay

334
00:22:07,486 --> 00:22:12,286
money to walk through the house
and then they try to scare you.

335
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:15,806
It's kinda hard to describe
unless you go to one. You can

336
00:22:15,806 --> 00:22:19,406
only go to a haunted house
around this time of year.

337
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:22,926
Sometimes if you go to a
pumpkin patch to get a pumpkin

338
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:27,166
they might also have a haunted
house there. So a haunted house

339
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:31,486
is basically an old building or
place where you go and you pay

340
00:22:31,486 --> 00:22:35,266
money get scared. It's kind of
weird to think about. It's done

341
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:39,186
for entertainment. It's done
for fun. I have only been to

342
00:22:39,186 --> 00:22:42,946
one haunted house in my life.
Uh and it did scare me. It I

343
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,906
think I mentioned it earlier
when I was younger. I went to a

344
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,026
haunted house where you rode a
little you were in a little

345
00:22:49,026 --> 00:22:52,546
car. It's kinda hard to
describe. It was like a little

346
00:22:52,546 --> 00:22:55,186
mini roller coaster haunted
house. I don't know. I'm not

347
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:57,906
making any sense. But it scared
me. I don't like haunted

348
00:22:57,906 --> 00:23:03,906
houses. You might watch a
horror movie. So earlier we had

349
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:06,866
the question about the
Halloween movies or Chucky or

350
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:12,386
there's a whole genre of movies
called Halloween movies. Um and

351
00:23:12,386 --> 00:23:16,866
these are movies that are
designed to entertain people by

352
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:20,546
scaring them. Okay. I've only
seen one horror movie in my

353
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:24,226
life. I think it was Pet
Cemetery by from Stephen King.

354
00:23:24,226 --> 00:23:28,466
Um and I didn't like it. I
really like movies. But I am

355
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:31,566
not a fan of horror movies.
Some people love horror movies.

356
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:35,246
They love movies where there's
just a lot of violence and

357
00:23:35,246 --> 00:23:38,846
people running around in the
dark and it's scary and there's

358
00:23:38,846 --> 00:23:43,326
monsters and I don't like them.
I just don't I just do not do

359
00:23:43,326 --> 00:23:47,646
not like horror movies at all.
Um here's a movie poster from a

360
00:23:47,646 --> 00:23:52,686
really old one. Um but I will
not be celebrating Halloween by

361
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:56,926
watching a horror movie. I
mentioned earlier that people

362
00:23:56,926 --> 00:24:01,226
will do pumpkin carving. Uh
pumpkin carving is something do

363
00:24:01,226 --> 00:24:04,586
after you buy a pumpkin. You
can see here that what you do

364
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:07,546
is you cut out the top of the
pumpkin and then you use a

365
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:13,226
knife to cut usually a face but
sometimes people will do like

366
00:24:13,226 --> 00:24:16,666
really decorative carving.
They'll really do something

367
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:21,226
cool and there are actually
pumpkin carving competitions in

368
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:24,666
some places around us right
now. So if you are really good

369
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:29,306
at it you could win a
competition. And then one thing

370
00:24:29,306 --> 00:24:32,106
that shows up this time of
year. This isn't specifically

371
00:24:32,106 --> 00:24:36,506
about Halloween. But we have a
of things that you can buy that

372
00:24:36,506 --> 00:24:40,426
have pumpkin spice flavour. So
you can go and get a coffee

373
00:24:40,426 --> 00:24:44,106
that's pumpkin spiced flavoured
coffee. You can get pumpkin

374
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:48,026
spiced flavoured cake. You can
get pumpkin spice flavoured

375
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:51,546
anything. You can get pumpkin
spiced flavoured candles. I

376
00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:54,266
know that sounds weird because
you don't eat a candle but it

377
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:57,706
smells like pumpkin spice. The
only way I can describe pumpkin

378
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:02,426
spice is you have to you have
to experience it to know if you

379
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:08,166
like it or not. I'm not a big
fan of pumpkin spice.
