1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,898
- I went to college, for the whole time.

2
00:00:02,898 --> 00:00:05,630
(audience laughing)
Holy shit, right?

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,210
I just got a letter from my college,

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,122
which was fun, 'cause mail, you know?

5
00:00:09,122 --> 00:00:10,820
(audience laughing)

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:13,250
So I open up the letter and they said,

7
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,280
hey John, it's college, you remember?

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,780
(audience laughing)

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,070
I say, yes of course.
(audience laughing)

10
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,480
And then they said,
how did they phrase it,

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,593
then they said, give us some money!

12
00:00:22,593 --> 00:00:24,260
(audience laughing)

13
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,149
As a gift!

14
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:28,750
We want a gift!
(audience laughing)

15
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,511
But only if it's money!

16
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:34,243
(audience laughing)
I found this peculiar.

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,170
'Cause you see, what
had happened New York,

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,970
was that when I was a student you see,

19
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,703
I had paid them a tuition money.

20
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:41,860
(audience laughing)

21
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,320
Every semester, two semesters
a year for four years.

22
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,230
I don't remember exactly what it was,

23
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,250
but rounding up, back in 1999 dollars,

24
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,620
it was about $15,000 a semester.

25
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,320
Two semesters a year for four years.

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,910
So it was about $30,000
a year for four years.

27
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,340
So it was about $120,000, okay?

28
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,340
So roughly speaking, I gave my
college about $120,000, okay?

29
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,480
So you might say that I
already gave them $120,000

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,240
and now you have the audacity
to ask me for more money?

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,962
What kind of a coke-head relative?

32
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:25,040
(audience cheering)

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,980
What kind of a coke-head
relative is my college?

34
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,709
You spent it already?

35
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:31,750
(audience laughing)

36
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,550
I gave you more money
than the Civil War cost

37
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,144
and you fuckin' spent it already?

38
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:40,850
(audience laughing)
Where's my money?

39
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,080
I felt like Jimmy Stewart
in "It's a Wonderful Life"

40
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,550
when he's screaming at his Uncle Billy

41
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,840
I was like, where's the money?

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,010
Where's that money you fat motherfucker?

43
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,110
Where's my money?

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,600
Stay down on the ground,

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,440
stay down on the ground you motherfucker!

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,970
That's not the dialogue, but
do y'all remember that scene

47
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,097
from "It's a Wonderful Life"?

48
00:01:57,097 --> 00:01:57,970
(audience laughing)
Great movie.

49
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,777
Frank Capra, 1946.

50
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:03,550
$120,000.

51
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,860
And I have friends I went to
college with and they're like,

52
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,770
oh, you should donate
and be a good alumnus.

53
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,580
And they wear shirts that say
school and it's like, look.

54
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,340
If you're an adult still
giving money to your college,

55
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,700
college is a $120,000 hooker

56
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,540
and you are an idiot who
fell in love with her.

57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,040
She's not gonna do anything else for you.

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,900
It's done.
(audience cheering)

59
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,870
In their letter they were like,

60
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,810
hey, it's been a while
since you've given us money.

61
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,380
I was like, hey, it's been a while

62
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,270
since you've housed and taught me.

63
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,103
(audience laughing)

64
00:02:38,103 --> 00:02:40,920
I thought our transaction was over.

65
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,800
I gave you $120,000 and you gave me like,

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,640
a weird cinder block room
with a "Reservoir Dogs"

67
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,910
poster on it and the first
real heartbreak of my life,

68
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,603
and probably HPV and
then we called it a day.

69
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,710
Probably.
(audience laughing)

70
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,740
Also, what did I get for my money?

71
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,482
What is college?

72
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:08,920
(stuttering)
(audience laughing)

73
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,410
Stop going!

74
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,030
Till we figure it out.

75
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,110
'Cause I went to college.

76
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,000
I have no idea what it was.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,860
I went to college.

78
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,270
I was 18 years old.

79
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,784
I looked like I was 11.

80
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:20,700
(audience laughing)

81
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,882
I lived like a goddamn Ninja Turtle.

82
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:26,882
(audience laughing)

83
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,753
I didn't drink water the entire time.

84
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:35,029
(audience laughing)

85
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:38,680
I lived on cigarettes,
and alcohol and Adderall.

86
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,530
College was like a
four-year game show called,

87
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,084
Do My Friends Hate Me or Do
I Just Need to go to Sleep?

88
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:48,830
(audience laughing)
But instead of winning money

89
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,600
you lose $120,000.

90
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,380
By the way, I agreed to give them $120,000

91
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,030
when I was 17 years old.

92
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,174
With no attorney present.

93
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,090
(audience laughing)
That's illegal.

94
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,740
They tricked me.

95
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,560
They tricked me like Brendan
Dassey on Making a Murderer.

96
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,910
They tricked me like poor Brendan.

97
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,360
They pulled me out of high school.

98
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,544
I was in sweatpants all confused.

99
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:16,690
(audience laughing)

100
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,570
Two guys in clip-on ties were like,

101
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,700
come on son, do the right thing.

102
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,990
Sign here and you'll be an English major.

103
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,030
I was like, okay.
(audience laughing)

104
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,460
Yes you heard me.

105
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,220
An English major.

106
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,120
I paid $120,000.
(audience clapping)

107
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,560
How dare you clap?

108
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,190
How dare you clap for the
worst financial decision

109
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,740
I ever made in my life?

110
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,650
I paid $120,000 for someone to tell me

111
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,394
to go read "Jane Austen"
and then I didn't.

112
00:04:48,394 --> 00:04:53,394
(audience laughing)
(upbeat music)
