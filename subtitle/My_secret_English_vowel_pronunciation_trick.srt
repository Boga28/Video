1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,480
Buh-clue.

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,480
Hi.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,629
I'm Ronnie.

4
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:04,870
I have something that...

5
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,240
Oh my god, this is amazing.

6
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,990
Honestly, this lesson
will change your life.

7
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,789
It changed my life when my good
friend, Leaf, told me about this.

8
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:17,929
Leaf, thank you; grammar god, you
are pronunciation god - Leaf.

9
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:18,929
Awesome.

10
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:25,190
So, I've been trying to figure this out for
ages, years, maybe 100 years because I'm a

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,210
vampire, and I got it.

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,738
Thank you.

13
00:00:32,738 --> 00:00:37,970
Are you confused about the
pronunciation of vowels in English?

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:46,399
So, for example, we have a long vowel sound,
and a long vowel sound means that the vowel

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,480
sounds like its alphabet name.

16
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,630
So, for example: "a".

17
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,070
But in English, we also
have: "aw" and "a".

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,390
Different ways to
pronounce the vowels.

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:03,230
One of them is a long vowel sound,
so "a" is pronounced like "a".

20
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:10,810
Then we also have a short vowel sound where
"a" is going to be pronounced like: "ah".

21
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:21,190
And how do you know when you read a
new word to say it like "a" or "ah"?

22
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,910
I have the answer.

23
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,690
Oh, it's amazing.

24
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,690
I...

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:33,010
Okay, I get really excited about things a
little bit too much; but this, I'm just super

26
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,010
excited about it.

27
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,310
And I want to teach you this - and, geez,
it's going to change the way that you read

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,040
things, the way that
you learn English.

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,500
So, give me some
money or something.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,850
Just, enjoy.

31
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,850
Listen.

32
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,140
It's amazing.

33
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,220
So, we have some guidelines.

34
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,380
Now, I want to make perfectly clear that people
like to say "grammar rules", and Ronnie hates

35
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,380
rules.

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,380
I'm Ronnie.

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,000
I do not like rules because they're made to
be broken; and in English, there's always

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,050
exceptions to rules.

39
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:13,530
So, you study a rule and you learn it, and
then you go: "Oh", but no - sorry; that's

40
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,530
an exception.

41
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,079
And then you say: "Why?"

42
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:20,609
Maybe you ask someone, maybe you ask your
teacher: "Teacher, why?" and the teacher goes:

43
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:22,890
"I don't know."

44
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,319
So, please think of these as only guidelines;
life-changing guidelines, though.

45
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,319
Okay?

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,319
I'm telling you.

47
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,459
So, we have words
that have two vowels.

48
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:32,459
Okay?

49
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:39,860
So: "a", "e", "i", "o", "u",
and sometimes "y" are vowels.

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,999
But this is our guideline: If in the
word you have two vowels, the first...

51
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:47,999
Oh, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,800
The first vowel sound...

53
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,930
The first vowel in the word is going to sound
like its alphabet name or it's going to sound

54
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,439
like a long vowel sound.

55
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,139
The second vowel, it's silent; we
don't even say the second vowel.

56
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,170
Crazy.

57
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,819
So, in English, if there's an "e" at
the end of the word - we don't say it.

58
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:20,120
In all of the other languages of the world,
we say all the vowels; but English, oh no.

59
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,459
The "e" is silent;
we don't say that.

60
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:31,470
So, if you have two vowels in the word, for
example: "a" and "e", we're going to say the

61
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,719
first vowel like it sounds
like in the alphabet, so "a".

62
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:42,299
We're going to say: "ba", and we do
not say: "bak-e"; we say "bake".

63
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,730
So, the first vowel is going to
sound like the alphabet: "bake".

64
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,379
What about this one?

65
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:57,879
We don't say: "fah-me",
like "ah"; we say: "fame".

66
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,269
And, again, we don't say the
last vowel in the word.

67
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,040
So, this works with
two-vowel words.

68
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,069
The "a" we pronounce like an "a", and
the "e" or the second vowel is silent.

69
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,180
One more time the rule;
it's life-changing.

70
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:19,390
The first vowel sounds like its alphabet name,
the second vowel is silent; we don't say it.

71
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,480
Let's try this again.

72
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,160
So, this is "a".

73
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,670
The next letter.

74
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,820
What's this vowel sound or what's
this sound in the English alphabet?

75
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,380
"A", "e".

76
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,530
So, we say: "these".

77
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,100
We don't say:
"the-se", "the-se".

78
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,480
"Look at the-se.

79
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,860
Look at these."

80
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:47,820
So, again, we're going to say the "e" like
an "e", and the second "e" is silent.

81
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,520
This is amazing.

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Woo-hoo.

83
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
This word.

84
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,660
So, you look: "dre-am".

85
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,170
"I had an amazing dre-am
last night; I was flying."

86
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,040
But it's actually just a dream.

87
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,050
So, one vowel we're going to say
"e", the second vowel is silent.

88
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,470
So, we don't say: "dre-am";
we say: "dream".

89
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,810
"I had a dream."

90
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,420
Did you have a dream
last night or now?

91
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,880
Are you imagining this?

92
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
No.

93
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
No, no, no.

94
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
This is real.

95
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Get back into this.

96
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
It's amazing.

97
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Let's see with this letter.

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,880
What letter is this?

99
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,350
Now, this is hard for you guys because in
your languages maybe this is "uh" and this

100
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,130
is "e", but in
English, this is "i".

101
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,460
So, watch this trick.

102
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,560
Put an eye-woo-hoo-on your "i".

103
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,580
So, this is the pronunciation
of the letter "i".

104
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,810
So, this word is "pie".

105
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,440
We don't say: "pi-e".

106
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,840
"I'd like some pi-e, please."

107
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,090
This word is "ice"; we don't
say: "ic-e" or "ec-e".

108
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,090
Okay?

109
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:06,270
So, again, we're going to say the "i"
like an eye, and the "e" is silent.

110
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,330
"Pie", "ice".

111
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,400
Well, this is making sense.

112
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,120
I wonder who made
this guideline.

113
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,430
Why didn't they tell me before?

114
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,530
This word: "drone".

115
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,190
Do you know what a drone is?

116
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,840
Do you know what pie is?

117
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
It's delicious.

118
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,960
But a drone is something that...

119
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:30,770
Like, a remote control aircraft that
you can make fly and find aliens.

120
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,770
What?

121
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,930
If you don't know what a drone is,
Google it, because I'm not Google.

122
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,930
So...

123
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:36,930
Or Yahoo, whatever.

124
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,140
A drone, we're going
to say the "o" sound.

125
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
"O".

126
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,160
So, we're going to say:
"drone"; not "drune", not...

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,590
Again, we're going to pronounce this like
an "o"; we're going to say: "drone".

128
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,270
What about this word?

129
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,890
This is confusing English.

130
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,320
"Soap" and "soup" Hmm.

131
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,060
Again, these are guidelines.

132
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,860
So, "soap", we don't
say: "so-ap".

133
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,850
"I used some so-ap yesterday.

134
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,120
It was delicious."

135
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,730
We say: "soap".

136
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,070
So, we don't even say the "e"
because the second vowel is silent.

137
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,950
We only say the first vowel.

138
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,510
It doesn't have to be an "e" at the end; if
there's two vowels together, we're going to

139
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,330
say the first one here and we're
not going to say the second one.

140
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,820
Damn, this is great.

141
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,500
Great content, Ronnie.

142
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,060
The next one, oo, so cute.

143
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,060
Eee.

144
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,330
"Cute", again, "u", "u", "u'.

145
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,780
You, you're cute.

146
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,500
So, "cute" is "c-u-t-e",
so we say: "cute".

147
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,180
What's this word?

148
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,680
This is a girl's
name, it's "Sue".

149
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,940
It's also a verb.

150
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:48,200
So, we say: "u".

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,400
"Sue" and "cute".

152
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,910
Again, we're not going to say
the "e" at the end of the word.

153
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:55,591
Are you getting this?

154
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:57,870
This is fun, this is
easy; I love this.

155
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,200
Now, English just became easier for me;
and I can imagine you, too, I hope.

156
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,030
So, let's go to the second one.

157
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:10,530
So, remember: If in one word you have two
vowels together or two vowels, the first one

158
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:16,130
is going to sound like its alphabet name and
the second one-shh-is silent; we don't say

159
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,680
it.

160
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,230
Okay?

161
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,670
If we have one vowel...

162
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:27,980
So, if we have a word that only has one vowel,
then our game is a little bit different.

163
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,880
And, again, this is a
guideline; not a rule.

164
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,009
The vowel sounds
like a relative.

165
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:36,799
Now, not your aunt
or your uncle.

166
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,348
A relative means, as I said,
the short vowel sound.

167
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,259
So, instead of having
"a", it's "ah".

168
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:54,879
So, we don't say: "hayd"; we say: "had", because
there's one vowel - it's going to be the short

169
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,180
vowel.

170
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,100
We don't say: "jaym"; we say...

171
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,120
Oh, hi, James.

172
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,269
We don't say: "jaym";
we say: "jam".

173
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:08,779
So, these vowels are "ah"; not
"a" because there's no vowel...

174
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:11,279
There's no two
vowels; there's one.

175
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,629
The next one: "I'm
going to go to bed.

176
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:22,190
I'm not going to go to bead",
but I'm going to go to "bed".

177
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,870
If we said it like this, it would be "bead"
and this would be "beand", which sounds like

178
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,699
I'm from New Zealand now.

179
00:09:28,699 --> 00:09:31,329
So "uh": "bed"; "uh": "bend".

180
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:36,699
There's only one vowel, so you're going to
say it like a short vowel - "bed", "bend".

181
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:43,480
Next one, it's a man and
it's "him" - "uh", "uh".

182
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,709
This word: "pin", "pin".

183
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,850
"I have pins.

184
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,439
I have safety pins
as a bracelet."

185
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:49,810
Don't steal my idea.

186
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,040
"Him", "uh"; and "pin", "uh".

187
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
We don't say...

188
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,269
Oh, I can't even say
this: "he-, hime.

189
00:09:58,269 --> 00:09:59,269
Hime.

190
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:00,269
Hime.

191
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:01,630
Did you see hime?

192
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,209
This pine is amazing."

193
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:08,300
So, we say: "him" and "pin".

194
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:15,029
In this letter, "o", if it's said like the
alphabet, it's "o"; but when it's like this,

195
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,509
it's "aw".

196
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:17,509
"Aw".

197
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:19,380
So it more sounds like this.

198
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,380
"Aw".

199
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Some people...

200
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,620
If you're cute-oo, oo, ute-if
you say: "Aw, you're cute."

201
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:30,019
So, this word is: "hot", this
"aw" sound and this is "snot".

202
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,319
Do you know what "snot" means?

203
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,620
It's one of my favourite words.

204
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,879
"Snot" is something that comes out of your
nose if you have a cold, with liquid, like

205
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:41,879
nose water.

206
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,790
We don't say "nose water" in
English; we call it "snot".

207
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,790
Yup.

208
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:56,180
So, snot-woo-hoo-mucous - we don't say:
"snowt"; we say: "snot", like the word "not".

209
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,389
We don't say: "sume";
we say "uh": "some".

210
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:03,709
So, we don't use the
"u"; we use "uh".

211
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:08,379
And we don't get on the
"baws"; we get on the "bus".

212
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:13,370
So we have "some" and "bus".

213
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,800
Do you understand this?

214
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,910
I hope so.

215
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:22,920
I think the most difficult one is the two-vowel
guideline - that one has been plaguing me

216
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,569
for years.

217
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:35,170
I am teaching you English, but
I'm not te-aching you English.

218
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,019
I'm only teaching you.

219
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:49,149
So, if you'd like to grab a cup of tea and review
this, I promise it will make your pronunciation

220
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:55,170
of English words, when you're reading new
words, like a breeze, which means very, very

221
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,170
easy.

222
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,019
And, again, thanks to Leaf.

223
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,019
Wow.

224
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,869
And thanks to everyone
out there for watching.

225
00:12:00,869 --> 00:12:03,379
I'm Ronnie, and I
will te-ach you soon.

226
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:04,610
No, I mean teach.

227
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:04,910
Bye.
