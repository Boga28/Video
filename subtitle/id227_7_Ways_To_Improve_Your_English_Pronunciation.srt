1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,710
When you're learning a language,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,070
you want to learn how to
pronounce each word correctly.

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,120
In this English lesson,

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,580
I'll show you seven things that you can do

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,067
to improve your English pronunciation.

6
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,734
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,030
Tip number one. You should
do some warmup activities.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,770
I'm not sure if any of you are singers,

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,830
but singers will often warm up their voice

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,840
before they sing in front of people.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,970
These same techniques can be very good

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,700
to help you develop the right muscles

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,150
and motion of your mouth
to make English sounds.

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,660
I actually do warmups before
I do my livestream on Fridays.

15
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,190
I don't sing during my livestream,

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,500
but I want my voice to be ready.

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,180
You can do something like this.

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,180
You can go e-e-e, e-e-e,
oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,070
ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah.

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,600
Sorry. It sounds a little silly.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,180
You might wanna do this
where someone can't see you.

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,210
And you might wanna practice
your consonants as well.

23
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,870
T-T-T, P-P-P, Th-Th-Th.

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,730
If you do this regularly,

25
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,220
it will help you develop the right muscles

26
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,890
in order to make the right English sounds.

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,940
Tip number two. Make a video
of yourself speaking English.

28
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,520
The best way to do this
would be to find a video

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,500
of someone else speaking English

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,440
and then record yourself
saying the same things

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,300
as the person in the video.

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,760
Then you can compare the two videos.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,450
You can look at how the
person in the original video

34
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,620
makes the sounds.

35
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,280
You can look at how they form
the sounds with their mouth

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,900
and then you can watch your video

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,030
and see if you're making the same shapes

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,820
with your mouth when you
try to say the same things.

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,200
So tip number two,

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,470
make a video of yourself speaking English,

41
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,050
and it's best to find
someone else in a video

42
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:52,050
speaking English and copy
them and then compare the two.

43
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,200
And then try to correct how you're forming

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,940
each sound with your mouth.

45
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,740
Again, this might look a little silly,

46
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,900
but it's a very good tip.

47
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,390
Tip number three. Record yourself.

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,520
This might sound a little
bit like tip number two,

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,150
but I want you to only
record the audio this time.

50
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,030
Again, find a recording of
someone speaking English

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,480
and try to record yourself
saying the same thing.

52
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,360
Then listen to it and
compare it to the original.

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,540
And in this situation,
don't do it right away.

54
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,820
Record yourself and
listen to it the next day

55
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,190
or listen to it a few days later.

56
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,590
Have you ever noticed that
when you hear yourself

57
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,320
on a recording, you don't
always sound like yourself?

58
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,790
This can really help.

59
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,160
This can help you to identify the things

60
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,370
that you've said wrong and
it can help you correct them.

61
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,420
Tip number four. Act out an
English scene with a friend.

62
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,790
So this one of course requires a friend

63
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,070
and it requires that you have a script

64
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,910
or that you've written down
what you've heard in a TV show.

65
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,970
So find a scene in one
of your favorite TV shows

66
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,180
and write down what the two
people are saying to each other.

67
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,820
Then find a friend who's
also learning English

68
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,280
and reenact what you saw.

69
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,810
So you have the original recording

70
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,400
that you can listen to later.

71
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,350
You have a friend that
you can practice with

72
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,900
and hopefully this makes
the practice more fun.

73
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,880
And then you can correct each other.

74
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,930
It will help you to mimic an
actual English conversation.

75
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,190
So tip number four.

76
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,470
Find a friend, find a script,

77
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,100
or write down the words that
two people say in a TV show

78
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,260
and then practice it with a friend.

79
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,080
Tip number five. Read out loud.

80
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,090
I cannot stress this enough.

81
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,820
It is very important when
you are learning English

82
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,540
to take the time to read out
loud every once in a while.

83
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,951
When you read out loud

84
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,130
you don't have to think about
what you're going to say.

85
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,500
You already have it on
the page in front of you.

86
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,300
And if you're reading anyways

87
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,190
because you enjoy reading in English,

88
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,200
why not take the time
every once in a while

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,640
to read out loud?

90
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,900
When you read out loud,

91
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,440
you practice using all of the
muscles that you would use

92
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,900
to speak English in a normal conversation.

93
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,261
So whenever you're reading a book,

94
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:01,890
whenever you're reading
the news on a computer

95
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,160
or on your phone, take
some time to read out loud.

96
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,650
Tip number six. Sing along.

97
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,570
Out loud, like, not quietly.

98
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,850
Whenever you listen to an English song,

99
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,674
sing out loud and sing loudly.

100
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:16,320
You'll probably wanna do this

101
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,980
when there are no other people
around, but sing out loud.

102
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,920
When you sing, you use a lot more force

103
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,600
than when you just talk.

104
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,433
When you sing,

105
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:28,830
you tend to over pronounce
and overemphasize words,

106
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,870
and this can be a really good thing.

107
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,250
So find a song.

108
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,320
Learn the lyrics to the song.

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,790
Learn the words to the song,

110
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,100
and take some time to sing it out loud

111
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,090
every once in a while.

112
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,660
Maybe choose a song for the
week and plan to sing that song

113
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,930
out loud four or five
times as the week goes by.

114
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,280
So, tip number six.

115
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,890
Find a good song. Sing that song out loud.

116
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,540
Sing it with gusto.

117
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,470
That's an English word,

118
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,630
but I wonder what language
it originally came from.

119
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,290
It means to sing with a lot
of joy and a lot of energy.

120
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:02,250
Tip number seven, the last
tip. Practice shadowing.

121
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,290
I'm going to explain this technique again.

122
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,870
I've explained it in other videos as well.

123
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,050
Shadowing is when you
find an English recording.

124
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,500
You find a recording of someone
speaking English or a video.

125
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,840
You play part of it, and you hit pause,

126
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,930
and then you say what
the person has just said

127
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,880
in the video or in the recording.

128
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,380
You can do this with my videos.

129
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,780
Some people do this with my videos

130
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,160
on my second channel.

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,766
They'll write out what I've said

132
00:05:27,766 --> 00:05:30,870
and then they will shadow
what I've said in each video.

133
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,370
But you don't have to use my videos.

134
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,200
Find any video on YouTube

135
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,385
where someone is speaking English clearly.

136
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,340
Hit play, listen.

137
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,850
Hit pause, say what they've
said, and then hit play again.

138
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,730
And keep doing that until you
get to the end of the video.

139
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,710
Shadowing is a great technique

140
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,860
for improving your English pronunciation.

141
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,230
Well, hey, thanks so much for
watching this English lesson

142
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,410
where I gave you seven tips, seven things,

143
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,290
that you can do to improve
your English pronunciation.

144
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,640
I hope they work for you.

145
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,040
Try at least one of
them, if not all of them

146
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,950
and see if your
pronunciation does improve.

147
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,540
Remember, if this is your first time here,

148
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,580

Gimme a thumbs up, leave a comment.

150
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,390

151
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,124
why don't you stick around and
watch another English lesson?

152
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,791
(upbeat music)
