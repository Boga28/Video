1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
I'm absolutely addicted. Who is tidier? 
Legs are just everywhere. I've lied to you.  

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,620
what is my worst habit? This is a conversation 
killer. I'm just trying to think of any other  

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,680
pet peeves you have. That's not true. That's 
the most obnoxious-looking jacket I've ever  

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,560
seen in my life. Can't keep up with myself. 
Now cry and laughter. Why are you crying?  

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,440
Hello, lovely students and welcome 
back to "English with Lucy." Today  

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,580
William and I, because you may have noticed that 
my husband is here with me. Hello, everyone. We've  

7
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,360
got a listening/conversation lesson. I think it's 
going to be interesting for you, but also for us.  

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,760
We might end up learning something about each 
other. Maybe, hopefully not because we've been  

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,060
together for nearly six years. So we're going 
to have a conversation on camera and for your  

10
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:04,560
benefit on screen as we are talking, interesting 
vocabulary words and phrases will appear. I have  

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,120
also created a free e-book for you. It contains 
the full transcript of this conversation, all of  

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:18,960
the key vocabulary along with the pronunciation, 
the definitions and examples, and a quiz so you  

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,700
can put what you've learned into practise. 
It's going to be an awesome resource. If you  

14
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,140
would like to download that free e-book, where do 
they have to click? Here? No. Where do they? Oh,  

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,520
down there? Yes. Okay. Just down there on the link 
in the description box. You then enter your what?  

16
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,880
Email address. And your name. And your name. 
Full name. Sorry. Can I ask, do you ever watch  

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,460
my videos?Sometime. You then join my mailing 
list and the e-book will come directly to your  

18
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,560
inbox. And then after that, you've joined the PDF 
club. You will automatically receive all of my  

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,940
free weekly PDFs in e-books, along with all of my 
course updates, offers, and general emails. It's a  

20
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:08,460
free service and you can unsubscribe at any time. 
Okay. I'm really excited to start this. Me too,  

21
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,020
but I have no idea what the questions are gonna 
be. Well, neither do I cause of one of my lovely  

22
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:21,960
teachers pre- , prepared them. Okay, I'll 
go first. What is my favourite food?Fruit,  

23
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:30,360
as a general answer, fruit, but to 
be specific, watermelons. Yeah. Oh,  

24
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,100
there's nothing like a good watermelon. And part 
of the fun of a watermelon is that they're not  

25
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:40,080
grown in England and you can't access them. 
So when you go abroad and there's a great  

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,580
watermelon. I sound like a total weirdo, 
don't I? Watermelon. You can't access them. 

27
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,880
I don't know. I think the majority of people 
whenever they go abroad and come to exotic fruit,  

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:58,620
I mean coconuts, for me. Oh yeah. Will loves a 
coconut. This isn't my question. No. So don't  

29
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,740
take over. No, sorry! Okay, that was a really 
easy one, I've made no secret of the fact that  

30
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,200
I'm absolutely addicted to fruit. Total fruit fan. 
Well, I also normally buy you a watermelon every  

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,000
birthday. That's true. And Easter. Because you 
don't like chocolate eggs. I do like chocolate  

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,760
eggs, but I prefer, I prefer a watermelon. I 
mean you can get chocolate anytime, but good,  

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:29,940
in season watermelon, in the UK. That's a luxury! 
Yeah! What did Will wear on your first date?  

34
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,460
I know this like the back of my hand because I 
remember calling my mum afterwards and being like,  

35
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,220
he's so nice but he wore a fleece 'cause I thought 
that was so weird. But there's this brand of  

36
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:52,140
fleece that only farmers seem to wear called a 
Schoffel or Schoffel. I'd never seen it before.  

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,080
It's a very soft fleece with a leather 
trim. And I just thought, I just,  

38
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,300
I'd never been out with a farmer before and I 
thought that's a farmer. You'd also just come  

39
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,040
back from Spain. Yeah. So if they were selling 
them in Spain, I would've said that they're in  

40
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,380
the wrong market. Yeah, that's true. Okay. My 
turn. What was the first film we saw together?  

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,019
Oh, I do know this because it was our fourth 
date. "Beauty and the Beast." Yes, it was. It  

42
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,460
was. And do you remember how I impressed you on 
that date? Actually, I did it in two ways. Yes.  

43
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:34,020
You brought beer to the cinema. In my handbag. In 
a cinema that didn't serve any alcohol. I brought  

44
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,760
only one for you because I'd also just passed 
my driving test by that point, it was February,  

45
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,240
and I drove you there in my little car and it 
was traumatic 'cause I wasn't a very confident  

46
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,060
driver. No. But I brought you a beer to have 
to relax after I traumatised you. That was very  

47
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,700
thoughtful. Oh, this is a tough one. How would 
Will describe himself in one word? Interesting.  

48
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,300
Laid back. Yeah. Predictable. You're very laid 
back. No, as in predictable answer, yeah. Yeah,  

49
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:13,140
or chilled. Chilled. Yeah, I'm okay with chilled. 
What would you say? To describe myself? In one  

50
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:29,580
word? Trying to think of the longest word I know. 
No. Good. Good! Spontaneous. No. Laid back I  

51
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,680
would say, I've always been laid back. Yes. In a 
good way though. It's better than being uptight.  

52
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:44,640
Yes. Opposites attract. You're looking at me 
like it's one thing we need to work on. Yeah. No,  

53
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,312
I wouldn't say I'm particularly uptight but 
I'm definitely not as laid back. I mean, you  

54
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:55,620
are horizontal to be fair. But I do, I like it. 
You bring a lot of balance to the relationship.  

55
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah. Life is all about balance. Okay. My turn. 
Who is better at remembering important dates?You.  

56
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:18,300
Why? Because my memory's appalling. No, it's 
not appalling. My mind thinks very quickly.  

57
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,680
So when I think of something, unless I write it 
down five minutes later, it might have drifted  

58
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,060
off and something else has come in and replaced 
it. I like the way you didn't say that you're  

59
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,900
forgetful. You said I think too quickly.  

60
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,880
I'm not forgetful. I'm just too fast. 
Life cannot keep up. So many ideas.  

61
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,020
Yeah. You come from laid 
back to think too quickly.  

62
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,400
Yeah, I can't keep up with myself. Now, cry 
and laughter! Why are you crying? Kinda,  

63
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,860
lights are bright on there. Yeah. it looks like 
you punched me in the face. Yeah. Don't say that,  

64
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,840
you'll start rumours! So when we started 
going out, you were a farmer. I mean,  

65
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,220
you didn't leave the farm. There was no option 
really. Yeah, my social calendar was empty. And  

66
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,440
it was only when we moved away that we started 
having lots more options, lots more opportunities  

67
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,540
to see other people, go away. And then we almost 
went through a phase where there were too many  

68
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,960
invitations and too much going on and there were 
multiple invitations on each weekend. And so I  

69
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,240
put in place a shared calendar. Yeah. But then 
we've had issues with you agreeing to things, but  

70
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
not putting it in the shared calendar. I've gone 
the other end of the spectrum, haven't I?Yes. I  

71
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,380
just said yes to everything. Yeah, there were 
quite a few times where you'd suddenly realised  

72
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:49,680
that you'd said yes to about three different 
people on the same day. But you know what? It's  

73
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,540
good problems to have. Look at us complaining 
about having too much fun.Too popular. Yeah.  

74
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,820
Who is tidier?Now, that's a hard one. Yeah, I'm 
wondering what your answer's gonna be. Yeah. So  

75
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:13,020
am I. I say that we are like swans, okay? We 
glide along beautifully like that. Everything  

76
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,660
looks fine. Yeah, looks just like a swan. But 
underneath the surface of the water, it's like  

77
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,020
legs are just everywhere. And I feel like that's 
what our personal life is like. Our business life.  

78
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,580
We're talking about tidying here. I'm getting 
there, okay? Okay. Right. From the outside,  

79
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:36,960
the house looks tidy and amazing but if you dare 
to open a cupboard, a load of crap. I think a lot  

80
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,840
of people can relate to that. I hope so. I hope 
a lot of people can relate to that. Yeah, I think  

81
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,600
probably part of my problem growing up was I had 
the tidiest mum on Earth and I almost rebelled  

82
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,300
against it. I felt like your mum was very tidy as 
well. She was, she had to look after three boys,  

83
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,020
so. So we were spoiled and we never learned 
to tidy for ourselves. I would say we're both  

84
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,080
pretty similar in tidiness as in like both 
quite untidy. What do you think? Yeah, well,  

85
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,920
what do they call it? Agree to disagree. 
Do you think I'm untidier? I think I'm  

86
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,800
slightly better. Okay. I'll accept 
that. For the sake of the video. No,  

87
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,620
for the sake of our marriage. Sorry, I've 
still got tears in my eyes, they are red.  

88
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:34,680
From when you claimed you think too quickly. 
And now they are back again. Yeah, cool. Ooh,  

89
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,560
this is a good one. Who is more adventurous?  

90
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,440
Ooh. So in general, I would say you.
Would you? I feel like diving into  

91
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,000
something new, you're a little bit 
more up for it compared to me. But  

92
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,100
when we actually get there, I feel 
like I probably then take the reins.  

93
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,840
I think this could describe our whole 
relationship. I feel like I'm very quick  

94
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,240
to go for something and adapt to it. And then you 
end up doing it better in the long run. And I'm  

95
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,780
thinking of every board game we've ever learnt. I 
always learn the instructions really quickly and  

96
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:22,260
I win for like the first 10 rounds and then you 
get it and then you like absolutely take over.  

97
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:31,020
Yeah, I would agree with that. I think that's 
spot on. Although with sports and taking risks,  

98
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:40,860
maybe you're--You never come to the start line. 
What is Will's pet peeve or biggest pet peeve?  

99
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:53,220
When people say 110%? Yes. Yes. I understand 
the idea. Sorry, I'm taking over now. No,  

100
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,580
I love that you're such a YouTuber, 
looking at the camera. No, I love  

101
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,180
the way the question is what's your pet 
peeve and I'm like I'll take over from here.  

102
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,820
Yes. I just think people take it too far. You 
can't give more. It's just a saying. No, people,  

103
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,420
they use it in every "Apprentice" video under 
the sun. Oh, so this is a TV show in the UK and  

104
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,700
America where people compete for a job position. 
I remember you coming back from trying to,  

105
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,680
I think you'd gone with your dad to buy a new 
car or something for the farm. It was a new  

106
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,480
farm vehicle. And I remember you coming back and 
said, "Everything we asked him, the guy just said,  

107
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,980
'110%, 110%, mate.'" Do the wheels work? 110%. 
How good's the engine? 110%. And it just comes  

108
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,400
across as insincere. Yeah. It's just doesn't 
make sense. Okay. It doesn't make sense. I'm  

109
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,420
just trying to think of any other pet peeves 
you have. Whenever I touch you with a cold  

110
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:55,380
foot. Yeah, I think every guy can relate. Guys, 
do you hate it when I touch you with a cold foot?  

111
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:01,260
Because we need to talk, basically. 
Okay. Who is more honest?  

112
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,360
I would say it's a 50-50 split. Can you elaborate 
on this 50-50 split? Mhm. You want me, you  

113
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,590
want me to elaborate? Yes, it's a 
conversation lesson, Will. Like,  

114
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:24,960
you are looking at me like I was dishonest about 
something this morning. No. No. I just, it's  

115
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:34,440
just the students are waiting. They know 50-50 
splits by now. I can't think of a time where  

116
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:42,120
I've lied to you. Ah, but this was years ago. 
What was that? And this was when I pretended to  

117
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,240
be on the farm when I was actually going to 
London to collect the engagement ring. Yes.  

118
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:58,380
What a terrible lie. Yeah. I don't think I've 
ever really lied unless-Keyword there. Really? No,  

119
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:05,340
I think it's just like you have the odd white lie, 
don't you? Yeah. You know, but nothing serious.  

120
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:12,060
But I think more as like honesty as a personality. 
I'm not one of those people that will, you know,  

121
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:17,580
not be able to sleep unless I tell the absolute 
truth and how I'm feeling in every single  

122
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,500
conversation. If someone asks me, do you like 
my dress? And I don't like it I'm not going to  

123
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,940
cause a scene and tell them that I don't. But I 
know some people stand by that and and think, no,  

124
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,300
if I don't like something, I'm gonna say it. Yeah. 
I'm quite good at letting things go. I'm quite  

125
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,840
tolerant. Yeah, that's another word I would use 
to describe you. Tolerant. Tolerant. That makes  

126
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:45,900
me sound like a nightmare. Yeah, I was gonna say 
the word you'd go for is tolerant. Yeah. And me?  

127
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:54,000
Tolerable. Yes. Persistent. This is a good 
question. Who is Will's celebrity crush.  

128
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:03,180
Oh, Jennifer Aniston. Yeah. Jennifer Aniston. I 
had to tell you that. I thought you were gonna  

129
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,440
say a a different answer. What was I gonna? 
I would like to think Scarlett Johansson,  

130
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,780
although she never really has. Messaged me. No.
Messaged you. Never really  

131
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,400
what? Come up in conversation.
I think she's mine if I had a female one?  

132
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah. Yeah, Jennifer Aniston. Yeah, Jennifer 
Aniston. Okay. This is a good one. What's the  

133
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:34,080
first gift I ever gave you? I think it was a red 
British and Irish Lions rugby jacket. I went to  

134
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:39,660
the ends of the Earth for that and by the ends 
of the Earth, I mean Luton. The jacket itself.  

135
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:45,300
So the British and Irish Lions, for those of you 
who don't know, it is a combination of England,  

136
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:52,620
Scotland, Ireland and Wales. And they 
play every four years-- Rugby. Rugby  

137
00:14:53,640 --> 00:15:01,320
against the southern hemisphere, whether it's 
South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. And it's  

138
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,920
something that's on my bucket list of going on 
one of their tours. It lasts two weeks to a month.  

139
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,160
And I've always followed them ever since I was a 
young child, I always wanted their kit. And there  

140
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,520
was one jacket in particular that I saw that year, 
which I really, really wanted. And I almost bought  

141
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:27,480
it for myself. But when I went to purchase it 
online on a website and it said there's one left  

142
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,480
in stock, I said, you know what? I'm gonna buy 
it tomorrow. And I went back the next day and it  

143
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:41,280
had gone and I was distraught. And this must 
have been two weeks before Christmas Day and  

144
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,200
Christmas Day came and I opened up my present 
from Lucy and there was this bright red British  

145
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:57,120
and Irish Lions rugby jacket. And you then 
told me the story of how you got it. It was  

146
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,020
really hard to get in time for Christmas. 
But then the even better part of the story  

147
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:08,100
is that we went to a friend's house to stay 
over and there was this really obnoxious guy  

148
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,860
who saw the jacket hanging on the back of a 
chair and was like, "Oh my God, that's the  

149
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,080
most obnoxious looking jacket I've ever seen in my 
life. Who the hell's is that?" And I was like, oh,  

150
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,840
that was my Christmas present to Will because 
it was a very bright red. Oh, bless that guy.  

151
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:32,100
He said if I could put a percentage on how 
much I hate that, it would be 110%. What  

152
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:39,420
song did you dance to for your first dance? 
"Smack My Bitch Up" by The Prodigy. Lucy.  

153
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:47,520
That's not true. "Say a Little Prayer" 
by Aretha Franklin. Yes. It was amazing,  

154
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:54,840
beautiful, romantic. What is my 
worst habit? Where do you start? Oh,  

155
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,480
this is a conversation killer I think. We'll 
make it the last question. I think your  

156
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,360
worst habit. Barking orders. Barking orders. 
What a terrible way of saying it, Will. No.  

157
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:21,000
Barking orders. Well, I do say that to you. Yeah, 
it's true. I don't bark though. No, I've got a  

158
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,620
good one actually. Okay. Worst habit was probably 
lack of driving that your reluctance to try and  

159
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:37,500
overcome your driving fears. I'm better. Yes. 
I still, when I approach a roundabout and I get  

160
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:42,780
there, I'm still not 100% sure who goes first. 
And it's like an innate thing. It comes from  

161
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,620
naturally., I do not know whether what side 
is my left and what side is my right. And  

162
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,280
you can say to me, oh, hold up your fingers like 
that. But it's still, it's the fact that I don't  

163
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,180
immediately know. Most people just... Do you just 
know what side of your body is your left and what  

164
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:02,100
is your right. Yes. I have to check. And then 
that takes me a second and then by that point,  

165
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:07,260
someone's already beeped me behind in the 
car and then I'm freaked out. Oh yeah,  

166
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,380
but it's always been that way. I mean even 
when I'm working on Excel and it's like delete  

167
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,060
left column, delete right column. I always 
have to be like left, right, one, two. Okay,  

168
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,900
it's that one that needs to be deleted. See, 
I believe if you practise something enough,  

169
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,040
whatever it is, you will overcome it. It just 
depends how long it takes you to then overcome  

170
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,640
it. You have witnessed me struggle with 
my lefts and rights. It's something more  

171
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:40,200
than just a lack of practise. You're perfect, 
don't beat yourself down. And manipulative.  

172
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:49,260
Okay, you can ask me one more question. What 
did Will want to be when he was younger? Ah,  

173
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,180
there are various things I think. I remember once 
you met your friend's dad who was an investment  

174
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,940
banker and was really rich and cool. So you wanted 
to be an investment banker. For one night. Yeah.  

175
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,160
I know that you wanted to be a farmer 
for quite a large part of your childhood.  

176
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,340
Did you ever want to be a rugby player? Yes.
You wanted to be a rugby player as well.  

177
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,480
What about when you were a little child? Did 
you ever want to be like a fireman or something?  

178
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,680
I think it was probably something to do with 
farming. Yeah. Yeah. Growing up on a farm helps.  

179
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,960
Do you know what I wanted to be when I was a 
child? I know you wanted to work in makeup,  

180
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,020
but that was later on. No, it wasn't makeup. 
What? Reconstructive plastic surgery. I did  

181
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,860
not know that. You didn't know that. That's the 
first question in all of this that I didn't know.  

182
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:49,080
When I was younger, I really loved making faces 
out of clay. And so I thought the perfect job  

183
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,320
for me would be to be a plastic surgeon but 
I wanted it to be a reconstructive one. So  

184
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,320
like people in car crashes and stuff, I could 
like make their faces look the way they did.  

185
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:08,940
And so I even did chemistry and biology and things 
at A Levels to carry on this until I realised no,  

186
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,580
I don't have a medicine degree in me. I'm not 
dedicated, hardworking or possibly intelligent  

187
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,060
enough to do that. So then I want to do 
marketing and now I'm a YouTuber. Natural  

188
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:28,440
progression. My parents are so proud. Okay, that's 
it from us. I hope you enjoyed learning a little  

189
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,660
bit more about both of us, but more importantly, 
I hope you learned lots and lots of interesting  

190
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,540
vocabulary. If you would like to read the 
full transcript and get a full list of all  

191
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:45,840
the vocabulary we used, all of the pronunciation, 
the examples, the definitions, we've included some  

192
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,360
listening comprehension questions. We've got a 
quiz on the vocabulary. Download the e-book. I  

193
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,320
know you're getting ready to point in the right 
direction. Where do they click? Just here? Yes.

all of my social media. I've got my Instagram  

197
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,960
and my Facebook. I've also got my website where 
I've got loads of lessons and a free interactive  

198
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,360
pronunciation tool where you can click on phonemes 
and hear how they're pronounced, and hear me  

199
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,600
pronouncing words containing those phonemes. I've 
also got all of my English courses now and Will  

200
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,440
has helped create these. It's been an amazing 
project, hasn't it? It's a team effort. Yeah,  

201
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,200
'cause we actually work together now and it's 
been really awesome. So we've got a B1 programme,  

202
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,920
the B2 programme, our pronunciation programme. 
And our C1's coming out in May. It is, I'll leave  

203
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:50,100
a waiting list down below or if it's already 
out, then I'm sure we'll put a link somewhere  

204
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,240
and we've got our challenges as well. I think 
we'll see them soon for another lesson. Bye-Bye.
