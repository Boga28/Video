194
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,839
if i smoke

195
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560
but he used a shortened form mind me

196
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
smoking

198
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
ahead

199
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
very nice to meet you jay now if you

200
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,720
wouldn't mind

201
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,839
mr jackson i'm happy to let you use my

202
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,000
phone

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,560
we can also say never mind to tell

204
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,200
someone

205
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,279
not to worry about something because

206
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,760
it's not important

207
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,959
should i ask where you've been

208
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,399
never mind we're long past that i

209
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,320
suppose

210
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,880
it's not a real cigarette what it's

211
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
electronic

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,760
it delivers the same amount of nicotine

213
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
but the smoke is water vapor

214
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,640
yeah what

215
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,839
led light

216
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,600
that's somewhat disappointing we say

217
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,160
something

218
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,399
is disappointing when it's not as good

219
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,800
as you hoped or expected

220
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,200
as she says later she'd rather see him

221
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,000
smoking a real

222
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
cigarette than a fake one somewhat

223
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,240
means a little bit

224
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,600
city of brotherly love turns out we uh

225
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,920
we know some folks there

226
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,839
and they told us that your tenure as a

227
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,360
police officer ended somewhat uh

228
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,800
dramatically would you rather have me

229
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
smoking for real

230
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
if you do something for real you

231
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
actually do it as opposed to pretending

232
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,760
to do it

233
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,399
example are the kids fighting each other

234
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
for real or are they just playing around

235
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,920
in a more slang way people also use this

236
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,680
to ask someone if

237
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,399
or say that they're telling the truth as

238
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,800
in this example she can lift 100 times

239
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,920
her own weight

240
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
for real what the hell am i supposed to

241
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,040
do with this

242
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,640
i would rather you be a man who did

243
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,360
exactly as he pleased

244
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,200
if you say that you would rather do

245
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,440
something you mean that you prefer to do

246
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,760
that and not something else

247
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
we often contract this with the pronoun

248
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,320
as in i'd rather have dinner at a

249
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,720
restaurant than go to the cinema

250
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,079
i'd rather spend thanksgiving at your

251
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,000
house than with my sister

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
things you find at the beach for us i

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,040
had seagull

254
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,200
to make a negative sentence we used the

255
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,399
collocation

256
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,519
i'd rather you didn't do something this

257
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:35,920
class

258
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,480
sounds like da bomb i'd rather you

259
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,440
didn't attend if you're not going to

260
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,519
take it seriously

261
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,399
what brings you to venice we use the

262
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:44,800
verb

263
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
bring in this way to ask why someone is

264
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
in a particular place

265
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,279
what brings are you i heard you were

266
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,040

didn't want to miss that

268
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,000
you tell me what my story is

269
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,079
okay um

270
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,920

usually in a specialized area

274
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,680
or maybe a girl from east germany

275
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,639
whose father's been kidnapped and

something for them

if someone is kidnapped a criminal takes

279
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,200
that person somewhere illegally by

280
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,760
force often in order to get money for

someone tries to get money from someone

287
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,720
or make them do something by threatening

296
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,399
something

297
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,880
here the preposition into indicates what

298
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
they're forcing her to do

299
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,800

really lily is there a man in my life

304
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,000
i have to wait and see let's take a look

305
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
at the connected speech in this sentence

306
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,920
which is how fluent speakers cut and

307
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,760
connect their words

308
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,200
have to is shortened to haveta

309
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,720
and wait and see reduces to wait and see

310
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,320
that is the t isn't fully articulated

311
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,720
and

312
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,160
and is just an

313
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,959
have to wait and see

314
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,000
join me for dinner too demanding

315
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
we usually say demanding to say

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,320
something requires a lot of attention or

317
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,680
effort like i have a demanding job

318
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,920
in this context however she means the

319
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,079
way he invited her sounds too

320
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,120
forceful or you could also say he won't

321
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
take no for an answer

322
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
i made a commitment to bernadette into

323
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,920
your family and

324
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,440
i've got a hell of a lot of nerve coming

325
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,959
in here and demanding that we postpone

326
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,360
this thing

327
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,040

328
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,000

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
