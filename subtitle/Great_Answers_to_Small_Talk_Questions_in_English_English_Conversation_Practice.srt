00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,880
When you're in a small talk
conversation in English,

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,480
how can you be sure that your answers
to common small talk questions are

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,440
just right? On my Speak Confident
English, YouTube channel,

4
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:16,440
I've recently received this comment
about answering small talk questions

5
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:21,190
in English. I'm good with asking
questions that initiate conversation,

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:26,350
but I always get nervous and
tripped up when it's my turn to

7
00:00:26,351 --> 00:00:27,870
answer and share about myself.

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,030
Do you ever feel the same way
in English speaking culture?

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,430
What exactly is expected
from you in a small talk

10
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:41,300
conversation and how do you find
the right balance between adding

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,900
the appropriate amount of
detail? Without saying too much?

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,780
I've got answers to those
questions for you coming right up.

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,050

23
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:42,990
before we get to great answers to
small talk questions in English,

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,830
if you're struggling with what
kinds of questions to ask in a

25
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:53,060
small talk conversation, I have
multiple lessons available for you.

26
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,580
In fact, my lessons on English,

27
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:59,620
small talk questions are some of my
most popular lessons here on YouTube.

28
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,860
I'll share links to several of them
in the notes below, but for today,

29
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,500
let's shift our focus to the answers.

30
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,290
How do you give great answers to
small talk questions in English?

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,650
When it comes to having a successful
small talk conversation in English,

32
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:21,210
there are three key questions
you need to consider. Number one,

33
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,770
what is expected of you in the
conversation based on who you're speaking

34
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:31,560
to and the situation you're
in consideration, number two,

35
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,919
how much do you share in
a small talk conversation?

36
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,360
How can you be sure to give
just the right amount of detail?

37
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,240
Not saying too much and not saying too
little and consideration number three,

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:51,070
how do you find ideas of what to
say so that you don't feel stuck

39
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,350
in the middle of the conversation?

40
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,550
Let's walk through each of those
considerations with key strategies,

41
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,320
important knowhow and
example answers to common,

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,280
small talk questions in English. So
that by the end of this lesson today,

43
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:12,280
you have absolute clarity on
how to respond successfully

44
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,000
to small talk questions in English.
So let's start at the beginning.

45
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:20,830
What exactly is expected
of you in a small talk

46
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,703
conversation?

47
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,510
This is an ideal time to
remember that language is culture

48
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,870
in English, speaking culture.

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,950
Small talk is a form of politeness.

50
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,980
It's an opportunity to recognize
the humanity of someone else.

51
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,380
Small talk is also a way to
establish a connection with others.

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,180
It allows us to tip toe into
a deeper relationship or

53
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,060
a deeper conversation if there's
a connection and last but

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,010
not least small talk is
a quick conversation with

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,530
back and forth or give
and take. In other words,

56
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,770
I ask you a question. You give me a
quick answer. You ask me a question.

57
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,010
I give you a quick answer
and we go back and forth.

58
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,320
No one dominates the conversation.

59
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,839
And this leads me to
what small talk is not

60
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,320
small talk is not a profound
or lengthy conversation.

61
00:04:25,029 --> 00:04:29,400
There's no expectation that
you have a long story prepared

62
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,830
and you don't need to worry about having
advanced level grammar structures or

63
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,830
high level vocabulary.
Small talk is simple,

64
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,029
quick and easy
conversation. And of course,

65
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,070
small talk is typically a conversation
we have with people we don't know very

66
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,460
well. For example, a colleague that
you see at the office regularly,

67
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,620
but you don't have a
close relationship with.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,980
It may be a professional
peer at a networking event
or a neighbor who lives down

69
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:05,540
the street or small talk
might be a polite conversation

70
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,410
with an absolute stranger, someone
that you're never going to see again,

71
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,930
for example, a woman at the
checkout counter in a grocery store,

72
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,523
your Uber driver,

73
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,690
a dental hygienist or someone you're
sitting next to on a three hour flight.

74
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,890
So with all of that in mind,

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,920
here are four things you need to
know about what is expected of you in

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,240
a small talk conversation
in English. Number one,

77
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,120
it's expected that you are present
in the conversation and that you're

78
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:37,750
polite.

79
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:42,080
That means no looking at your phone
or trying to ignore the other person.

80
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,710
Number two, it's expected
that you give and take.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,070
This means to have a quick
exchange of question and answer.

82
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,550
No one is dominating.

83
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:58,960
No one is giving lengthy
stories and preferably

84
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,480
no one is giving one word answers.

85
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,000
The third expectation is that you
listen carefully to help you find

86
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,240
connections. And finally,

87
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,120
the fourth expectation is
that you are prepared to share

88
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,870
something about yourself.

89
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:19,870
It doesn't have to be deeply
personal or too serious,

90
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,910
but you do need to be ready to
share details about yourself,

91
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,110
about your life,

92
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,230
because this is how connections
are made before we get into

93
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:36,020
talking about how much should
you really say in a small

94
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,133
talk conversation.

95
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,339
Let me give you a quick example of
a real small talk conversation I had

96
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,940
recently that demonstrates
these expectations.

97
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,820
And in this example,

98
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,890
I'm actually going to use a question
that I recommend in my lesson

99
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,130
titled easy, social, small talk questions.

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,170
This small talk conversation
happened just a few days ago.

101
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,690
When I returned home from a trip, I
got into a car and said to the driver,

102
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,970
it's rush hour in DC right now, which
I know is always super stressful.

103
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,760
How's your day going so far
with a short, easy response.

104
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,480
The driver said it's been pretty easy,
but I've had a lot of airport trips.

105
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you coming to DC for a
visit or are you coming home?

106
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,120
My quick response coming home,

107
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,870
I was just out of town for a few days to
visit family, but I'm glad to be home.

108
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,650
What about you?

109
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,350
Are you a DC native and his
response to that actually I'm from

110
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:39,030
Mongolia, but I've been living here
in DC for the last seven years.

111
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,590
Let me stop here with that example,

112
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,510
do you notice that every
response was short and simple

113
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:51,860
and every response ended with a
question for the other person,

114
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:56,500
there was clear, polite,
back and forth happening.

115
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,820
And each question asked was
related to what had been previously

116
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:02,650
said,

117
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,290
demonstrating that each of us was
listening to the other person carefully,

118
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,050
as you probably noticed. There
were also a few personal details,

119
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,130
nothing too serious.
However, in my answers,

120
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,890
I shared that I was coming home to DC
and I had recently been traveling to see

121
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:22,370
family in a moment.

122
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,840
We're going to come back to this
conversation because after those first

123
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,480
initial small talk questions,
I had a choice to make.

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,040
I could either bring the conversation
to a polite close and spend the rest of

125
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:38,520
the time in the car, on
my phone checking email,

126
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,320
or I could continue the
conversation. But for now,

127
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,390
this is the perfect time to transition
to the second key consideration

128
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:49,390
we talked about earlier,

129
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,400
how much information should you
share with the person you're

130
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,234
speaking to?

131
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,520
What is too much and what
is not enough to answer this

132
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:05,080
correctly and to ensure a
successful conversation.

133
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:07,960
There are three things we
need to think about first.

134
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,480
What is your relationship with
the person you're speaking to?

135
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,390
Are you speaking to someone
who is a total stranger?

136
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,590
Is it a vague acquaintance or is
it a coworker that you see daily,

137
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:22,510
but don't know very well.

138
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,750
The second thing you want to think about
when determining how much to share is

139
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,100
the specific situation or
context that you're in,

140
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,700
is it a random conversation in the
middle of a busy street or during a

141
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,179
busy time at the grocery store?

142
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,940
Or are you at a networking event
trying to build a relationship?

143
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,020
Are you just passing time using small
talk as a form of entertainment?

144
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:52,210
For example, just before
a business meeting starts.

145
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,010
And the third thing to think about
when determining how much to share

146
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,130
is how much time are you going
to have with this person?

147
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,809
Are you just passing by someone
you kind of know on the street,

148
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,280
are you sitting next to a stranger on
an airplane for the next three hours?

149
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,679
Or is it a quick Monday morning
conversation at work while you're pouring

150
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,760
yourself a cup of coffee,

151
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,600
these details will impact
the extent to which you

152
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,440
share and what kind of details
you include when responding to

153
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,030
small talk questions in English,

154
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,830
we're going to take a look at a few
different examples and how we might adjust

155
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:37,910
our answers based on these different
scenarios. But before we do,

156
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,110
here are some helpful
guidelines to think about.

157
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,660
If the individual you're speaking to or
initiating small talk conversation with

158
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,620
is a complete stranger,

159
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,300
it's better to keep your
answers broader or more general.

160
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,820
Particularly at the beginning,

161
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,780
remember that small talk is intended
to be polite, easy and simple.

162
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,809
So there's no need to rush into
anything too personal it's best

163
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,290
to stay light.

164
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,330
This is why you'll often hear
English speakers start small talk

165
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,530
conversations about the weather,
no matter where you are.

166
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:19,570
It can be in line at the coffee shop,

167
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,120
checking out at the grocery store or
talking to someone at the doctor's office.

168
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,880
However, if the person you're
speaking to is someone that, you know,

169
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,400
maybe not very well, but
a coworker or a neighbor,

170
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,600
then it's definitely
appropriate to include family

171
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,360
details, personal details,

172
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,510
or maybe even give answers that
get into how you feel about

173
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:47,950
something or what your opinion
might be. In other words,

174
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,710
the stronger connection
you have with someone,

175
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,280
the more details you might add,

176
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:58,720
and the more personal you might
be to demonstrate this and to look

177
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:00,840
at how we might adjust our answers.

178
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,840
Let's use another example from
my less entitled, easy social,

179
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,800
small talk questions. If you've already
reviewed that lesson, then you know,

180
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,630
a common way to start a small talk
conversation is to begin with a compliment

181
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,550
followed by a question recently,

182
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,230
one of my students experienced
this here in the United States,

183
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,590
she's from Brazil and she
was visiting New York city.

184
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,150
While walking down a busy street,

185
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:32,300
a total stranger came up to her and
said, oh my gosh, I love your shoes.

186
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,820
Where'd you get them in that moment?

187
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,220
My student wasn't really sure
what to say or how to respond.

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,620
Why is this total stranger in
the middle of New York city,

189
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:48,140
talking with her and starting a
conversation to help us think about

190
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,290
how to respond in a
polite, appropriate way.

191
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,330
Let's use our three considerations,

192
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,850
the relationship with the person you're
in the situation and the length of time.

193
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,410
In this example, we have a complete
stranger on a busy New York street.

194
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,080
Clearly there isn't a lot of
time to get into an in depth

195
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,080
conversation. In fact,

196
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,440
there isn't much time to give
very many details at all,

197
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,559
but there is the expectation
for a polite response

198
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:24,720
in this context, an appropriate
answer might be thank you so much.

199
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,670
Unfortunately, I didn't get them here
in the United States and that's it.

200
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,590
At that point, the light
might change to green.

201
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,110
Everybody starts walking and there's
really not an opportunity to ask another

202
00:13:37,429 --> 00:13:40,550
question or have any sort
of back and forth. However,

203
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,820
a small talk conversation did
happen. It was easy, simple,

204
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,260
and polite. Now let's change
this scene just a little bit.

205
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,179
This time you're at work making coffee
on Monday morning in the break room,

206
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,620
one of your coworkers walks in and says
exactly the same thing. Oh my gosh,

207
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,530
I love your shoes. Where'd
you get them this time?

208
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,130
You know the person you're at work,
where you see each other regularly,

209
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,370
and you probably have a few minutes
together because you're waiting for the

210
00:14:13,371 --> 00:14:16,570
coffee to brew because of
this closer relationship.

211
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,090
And because you have a bit more time,

212
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:23,680
an appropriate answer to that
question would be thanks so much.

213
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I just got 'em last week at Macy's and
they're so comfortable for standing

214
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,080
around all day on my feet
at work. What about you?

215
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:35,480
What are your go-to shoes
for work? In this example,

216
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:39,870
we have a bit more detail where you
got the shoes and why you like them.

217
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,470
And we have a polite related
question for back and

218
00:14:45,471 --> 00:14:49,350
forth. We're inviting the other
person into the conversation.

219
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,400
What makes this exchange
successful is first

220
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,040
we've avoided a one word answer.

221
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,440
Short answers such as yes, no thanks.

222
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:07,800
Good. These answers lead to
awkward moments of silence,

223
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,870
uncomfortable conversations,
and disappointing experiences.

224
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:14,910
In this response,

225
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,110
we also avoided giving too much detail

226
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,070
or dominating the conversation.

227
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,750
There were no long stories about
the lines at Macy's or forgetting

228
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:31,980
a wallet in the car.
It was a short, quick,

229
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,540
polite response with just
one or two key details.

230
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,100
And that's all you need.

231
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,660
If you're someone who
loves a good formula,

232
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,330
you just want to know exactly
how much you need to say.

233
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,210
Considering just one or
two details is enough.

234
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,890
It's important to know
that in small talk again,

235
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:59,130
the expectation is that it
is quick back and forth.

236
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,090
If someone wants to know more
about your experience or your story

237
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,760
or your ideas, your opinions,
they will ask for more.

238
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,480
So keeping your answers short, simple,

239
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,960
and polite is all you need.

240
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,480
Before we talk about that last
key consideration of how you

241
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,430
can identify details to share so that
you don't feel stuck in the middle

242
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:31,350
of a conversation. Let's talk
about small talk questions.

243
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:33,990
When you have a lot
more time. For example,

244
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:38,910
those 15 minute Uber drives
or a three hour flight in

245
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,110
the last two examples,

246
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,540
I shared a busy New York street and
while making coffee at the office,

247
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,340
it was clear that there wasn't a lot
of time for conversation. However,

248
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:54,180
when driving to an airport across the
city or sitting next to someone on a

249
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,220
flight, it's clear that
you have a lot of time.

250
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:01,490
And in these situations you have two
options after some of that initial

251
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,770
small talk. If it occurs first,

252
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,930
you can bring the conversation
to a polite close,

253
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,770
and I'll give you a few examples
of how to do that in a moment.

254
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,770
Your second option is to
keep the conversation going,

255
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,359
perhaps in those first small
talk questions, you find
an interesting connection.

256
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:23,999
You're enjoying the conversation.
So you keep going further.

257
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:28,159
At the beginning of this lesson
today, I shared a recent example.

258
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,720
I had of a conversation on my way home.

259
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:33,760
After arriving in DC,

260
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,950
the Uber driver had just shared that
he was originally from Mongolia,

261
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,950
but had been living in DC
for the last seven years.

262
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,510
If I had wanted to bring
that conversation to a close,

263
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,359
here are a few polite phrases
I could use to do that. Wow,

264
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,200
that's really interesting. I hope
that you've enjoyed being here in DC.

265
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,619
If you don't mind,

266
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,320
I'm gonna take the last few minutes
to catch up on my work email because I

267
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,240
missed quite a bit while
I was on the flight.

268
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,590
Or if you're sitting next to someone
on an airplane after the first

269
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,990
few minutes of a small talk conversation,

270
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:14,750
you might wanna go back to your
book or just listen to some music.

271
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,790
That's usually what I like to do.

272
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,990
So here are some ways I bring
those conversations to a close.

273
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:25,270
I hope you have fun visiting
your family. If you don't mind,

274
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm gonna try to get a nap for
the remainder of the flight.

275
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,060
I had to get up super early
today. And then from there,

276
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,540
you can put on your headphones,

277
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,100
close your eyes and not worry
about continuing the conversation.

278
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,820
A third polite option to
close a conversation would be,

279
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,330
it sounds like you had a great time on
your vacation. I'm glad to hear it. Well,

280
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,770
if you don't mind, I'm
gonna get back to my book.

281
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,010
I don't get a lot of free time to myself.

282
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:57,490
So I relish these opportunities on
flights to get into a good novel.

283
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:02,920
And from there, you can get your
book out and get back to reading.

284
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,280
However, as I said,

285
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:09,160
if you found a connection and you
want to keep the conversation going,

286
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,480
you can certainly do that by asking
continued small talk questions.

287
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,160
And as those connections get stronger,

288
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,510
the questions you ask might get a
bit more personal or more in depth.

289
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:28,790
And now our third key consideration
for how to give great answers

290
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:34,030
to small talk questions in
English is how exactly do you get

291
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,270
ideas for what to say so
that you don't feel stuck?

292
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,820
I have three quick tips for
you on this one. Number one,

293
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,820
use question words, number two,

294
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,140
share bite sized information.
And number three,

295
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,940
add hooks with conjunctions to expand.

296
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,100
Let's take a look at each of those a
bit more in depth with tip number one,

297
00:19:58,869 --> 00:19:59,970
use question words.

298
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,090
Those are w H and H words such as who,

299
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,010
what, when, where, why,
how, how many, how often,

300
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:13,690
how long and so on when
someone asks you a small talk

301
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:15,250
question, for example,

302
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,240
if your neighbor says your
garden looks beautiful,

303
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,840
what's your secret to
growing healthy plants?

304
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,520
A response could be thanks so much.

305
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,240
I guess I've always had a bit of a
green thumb. When I was growing up.

306
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,760
My family had a big garden.

307
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,070
One thing I learned is to
never over water your plants.

308
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,270
What about you? Are you
a gardener? Similarly,

309
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:43,990
if someone asks you about what
you do for fun in your free time,

310
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,400
a response might be, well, I don't
get a whole lot of time to myself,

311
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,320
but when I do, I try to stay
offline for the last few years.

312
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,840
I've been learning to
paint. What about you?

313
00:20:56,841 --> 00:21:00,560
What do you do when you have
time in each of these examples?

314
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,520
I'm sharing just one or two
key details in the answer.

315
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,830
And I'm finishing with a question and
this brings me to tip number three,

316
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,350
add a hook with conjunctions
to expand a hook is

317
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:18,230
something you say to
keep someone's attention.

318
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,830
It's what you say to engage someone
or to keep them listening to you.

319
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,220
And conjunctions are
words such as because so,

320
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,420
and since four, but when we use these,

321
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,260
it helps us to add that next
detail into the sentence.

322
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,900
For example, if someone
asks you how you're doing,

323
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,730
you can avoid a one word answer
by using a conjunction in

324
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:49,090
one of these example, sentence starters.

325
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:54,450
My day's been great because
I'm doing pretty well since

326
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,420
it's been a little difficult
because it's going great. Thanks.

327
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,650
I'm looking forward to it
and it could be better.

328
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,290
But with each of those,

329
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:10,450
it's clear that more information
should follow those conjunctions.

330
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:14,690
When we use them, it helps us
to add those important details.

331
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:19,090
If we review the last two example
answers I shared with you,

332
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,040
you'll notice I used conjunctions in both.

333
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,560
And the first one about
growing healthy plants I used,

334
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,200
because I guess I have a bit
of a green thumb because,

335
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,850
and then I continued with my
details in the second one. I said,

336
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,200
well, I don't have a lot
of free time to myself. So,

337
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,880
and then once again,

338
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,200
I continued with my detail when it
comes to providing great answers,

339
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,280
to small talk questions in English
and having a successful conversation.

340
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,840
Here are the four key things I want
you to remember from today's lesson.

341
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,310
Small talk is polite,
easy, quick conversation.

342
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,869
While you're having the conversation.

343
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,109
It's important to reflect on the
relationship you have with the individual,

344
00:23:08,609 --> 00:23:11,990
how much time you have together
and the situation you're in.

345
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,780
It's important to keep
your answers detailed.

346
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,900
But brief one to two
details is more than enough.

347
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,500
And if someone wants to know
more, they'll ask lastly,

348
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:29,980
you can activate ideas and avoid
getting stuck by using question words,

349
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,020
to help you and use conjunctions,

350
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,250
to expand your answer with that.

351
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:41,250
You have everything you need to know
about what is expected of you and how to

352
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:44,130
have fantastic small talk
conversations in English.

353
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,119
