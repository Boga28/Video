1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,998
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish

2
00:00:03,998 --> 00:00:06,896
and this is a lesson I'm excited about because we're going to be

3
00:00:06,896 --> 00:00:11,726
working on your listening skills, especially to help you understand

4
00:00:11,726 --> 00:00:14,255
fast-talking native English speakers.

5
00:00:14,378 --> 00:00:19,558
The secret is reductions. I know that for so many of my students,

6
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:23,751
it is hard to understand native English speakers in real life,

7
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:26,114
when you're watching movies or you're watching TV

8
00:00:26,114 --> 00:00:29,678
because some of us speak so quickly.

9
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,774
We connect words, we delete, we change sounds.

10
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:37,850
There is a huge difference between the word that you expect

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,936
to hear, the word that you learned and then the word that actually

12
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:46,065
comes out of our mouths, right? So to help you understand

13
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:49,824
native English speakers, I'm going to help you to practise

14
00:00:49,824 --> 00:00:53,090
and to recognise the most common reductions,

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,568
the ones that you hear native speakers use every day,

16
00:00:56,837 --> 00:01:00,657
I'm going to help you to practise hearing them but also practise

17
00:01:00,657 --> 00:01:02,385
using them if you want to.

18
00:01:02,385 --> 00:01:06,000
You'll also find a PDF download with all of the

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,436
expressions that we'll practise in today's lesson including the

20
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,194
pronunciation notes and some example sentences

21
00:01:12,194 --> 00:01:14,430
that you can practise with at home.

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,515
There's also the answers to the quiz which is going to be at the

23
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:21,234
end of this video so make sure you stick with me until the end,

24
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:24,691
grab the workbook, the link is down in the description below.

25
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,819
What makes listening to native English speakers so hard?

26
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:37,985
I think there are a few different answers to this question but

27
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:40,906
one in particular that I want to highlight for you

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,152
is that you learn English at school like this:

29
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:46,760
What are you doing this afternoon?

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,532
And then you go out into the real world and you hear this:

31
00:01:51,532 --> 00:01:52,975
What are you doin' this arvo?

32
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,610
The sounds that you associate with these words here

33
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,925
need to adjust, don't they?

34
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:04,048
You need to teach your brain to recognise the sounds 

35
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:08,011
and to associate them with the words that you already know

36
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,849
so that your brain's not

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,919
hearing something strange but then sifting

38
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,404
through your head going:

39
00:02:14,404 --> 00:02:16,473
What's sarvo?

40
00:02:16,473 --> 00:02:22,751
We just need to train your brain to hear 'sarvo' and associate it with

41
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:24,404
this afternoon.

42
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:29,893
To be fair, 'sarvo' is a very Australian expression.

43
00:02:29,893 --> 00:02:33,432
The expressions that you hear and you learn in this lesson today

44
00:02:33,432 --> 00:02:36,826
are really common across different types of English.

45
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:40,731
They're used in lots of different places where English is spoken

46
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:44,221
and the lesson is going to help you to understand TV shows

47
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:48,000
a little better, it's going to help you to understand fast-talking

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,844
native English speakers and if you are ready to take on some of

49
00:02:52,844 --> 00:02:55,892
these expressions yourself, it's going to help you to sound a little

50
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:59,561
more natural as you speak in English as well.

51
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:03,083
So let's get started with some really common greetings

52
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,328
that often get reduced.

53
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,017
How's it going? 

54
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:12,130
Try it.

55
00:03:13,523 --> 00:03:24,194
How's it going?

56
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:30,148
This is like how is life going? How are things going? 

57
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:33,826
I hope, you know, you're well - it's a really common greeting

58
00:03:33,826 --> 00:03:35,206
that we use all the time.

59
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:39,083
How are you going?

60
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,542
That R is completely dropped, right?

61
00:03:43,762 --> 00:03:45,947
Well you might hear a little schwa, 

62
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:49,022
How are you going?

63
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:53,455
And notice as well that that -ng sound at the end

64
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,692
drops just to a 

65
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,454
How are you going?

66
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:01,549
How are you?

67
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,748
Super short, right?

68
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:05,352
How are you?

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,847
Let's listen one more time just to get used to those sounds

70
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:11,940
of these really common greetings.

71
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,057
How's it going?

72
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,599
How are you going?

73
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,311
How are you?

74
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,971
You is one of the most common English words. We use it

75
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:23,194
all of the time in lots of different expressions

76
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:25,795
and it's often unstressed

77
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,107
so it often sounds quite different.

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,366
What do you. 

79
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,765
What do you can sound like

80
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,158
What do you want for dinner?

81
00:04:39,818 --> 00:04:42,598
But we also say whatcha?

82
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:45,140
Whatcha want for dinner?

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,120
You'll hear both of these forms being used by native speakers.

84
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,492
If you want to try it out for yourself then just choose the one

85
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:55,767
that feels most comfortable for you, the sounds

86
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,641
that are most comfortable for you, try it.

87
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:00,731
What do you want for dinner?

88
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,398
Whatcha want for dinner?

89
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,471
But here's the thing,

90
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:11,448
'what do you' and 'whatcha'

91
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,112
can also mean what are you?

92
00:05:15,943 --> 00:05:18,687
What are you?

93
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,735
What are you doing tomorrow?

94
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,388
What are you doing tomorrow?

95
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:28,255
The secret to knowing exactly what expression

96
00:05:28,255 --> 00:05:32,066
is being used is to listen to the verb that follows.

97
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:36,181
If it's the base form, then it's in the present tense

98
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:40,908
and the auxiliary verb is do. If it's in the -ing form,

99
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:45,466
it's the continuous tense and our auxiliary verb is be.

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,748
What are you doing tomorrow?

101
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:54,409
Let's talk about where do you.

102
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,439
So we've got do and you, both of the vowel sounds reduce

103
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,533
to the schwa and they connect, don't they?

104
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,382
Where do you want to go?

105
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:14,008
We can also use that sound like we were practising earlier.

106
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:17,631
Instead of 'where do you'

107
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:20,801
Where do you want to go?

108
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:27,542
And if we just look at do you, it can sound like do ya.

109
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,501
Do you like it?

110
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:30,642
But it can also sound like

111
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,219
Do you like it?

112
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,247
Try it.

113
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:39,580
Do you want to?

114
00:06:40,386 --> 00:06:41,563
Do you wanna?

115
00:06:42,638 --> 00:06:46,519
This one is even more connected than the previous one, isn't it?

116
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,933
Can you hear how 'do you want to'

117
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,740
when it's said really quickly, it sounds like

118
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,746
Do you wanna?

119
00:06:57,683 --> 00:06:59,111
Do you wanna go get lunch?

120
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,423
Do you want to go get lunch?

121
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:07,060
Could you becomes could you.

122
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,285
Could you pass the salt?

123
00:07:12,871 --> 00:07:13,771
Would you?

124
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,041
Would you like to watch a movie tonight?

125
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,766
What about when that becomes a negative modal,

126
00:07:23,766 --> 00:07:25,578
wouldn't you?

127
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,000
Wouldn't you?

128
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:31,786
Wouldn't you agree?

129
00:07:32,715 --> 00:07:36,414
When we're talking about reductions it's really common for

130
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,830
vowel sounds to reduce to the schwa sound so they become

131
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,736
unstressed, softer, lower in pitch and so with the verb have,

132
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,760
we have the

133
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:50,517
vowel sound that we learned, right?

134
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:54,346
But it's reduced down to the schwa.

135
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,372
So when you look at should have,

136
00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,620
we reduce that down it becomes should have

137
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,642
or it's also common that that V gets dropped as well in spoken

138
00:08:07,642 --> 00:08:10,560
English so instead of hearing

139
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,953
should have, you just hear the schwa sound

140
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:19,840
as have, should have.

141
00:08:22,744 --> 00:08:24,709
I should have thought about that.

142
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:27,461
It's the same role for would have,

143
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:31,291
you might hear would have or woulda.

144
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:35,538
I would have been here sooner but the traffic was crazy.

145
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:36,809
Try it.

146
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,471
Could have becomes could've or could've.

147
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,769
I could have been here sooner but I got held up

148
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,917
and again with might have.

149
00:08:53,626 --> 00:08:57,069
Now I want to draw your attention to what's actually happening

150
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,804
here. The reduced word is the same, have,

151
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:04,644
but the reduction and the way that it sounds often changes

152
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,041
depending on the letter that comes after it.

153
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:13,059
So using might have, as an example, you might hear might have.

154
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,546
He might have done it already.

155
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,072
So in this sentence, the word after might have

156
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,695
starts with a consonant sound, right?

157
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:25,522
So it becomes might have, the ending is just a schwa.

158
00:09:25,522 --> 00:09:29,787
But you will also hear might have,

159
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:33,393
just like we were practising with the other modals with have.

160
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,983
Might have.

161
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:41,880
If the word starts with a vowel following then we hear that sound.

162
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,372
Might have already been there.

163
00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:48,344
Now what is so interesting about these modal verbs with have,

164
00:09:48,344 --> 00:09:53,463
could have, should have, would have, might have,

165
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:58,360
so with all of these reductions the word after have

166
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,746
impacts the pronunciation.

167
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:01,872
Could have run.

168
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,504
Should have seen.

169
00:10:03,504 --> 00:10:04,981
Would have done.

170
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,443
Might have been.

171
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:10,718
Now I've got one last little hint or tip that I want to give you about

172
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:16,867
this might have or might have, it sounds like might of

173
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,455
which is grammatically incorrect.

174
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:23,363
This is a mistake that lots of native English speakers make too.

175
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:30,682
Might of is not actually a correct phrase or statement in English.

176
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:36,837
It's always might have, it just sounds like might of.

177
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:38,625
I might have done it.

178
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:39,944
I might have been there.

179
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:43,728
It's not might of but might have.

180
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,496
Speaking of of, let's talk about some reductions with of because

181
00:10:48,496 --> 00:10:52,026
there are several really common ones that I want to share.

182
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:56,459
When of gets reduced, it reduces down to the schwa.

183
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:57,931
We hear. 

184
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:06,000
So listen out for them. We have kind of becomes kinda.

185
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,356
He's kind of bossy, isn't he?

186
00:11:10,064 --> 00:11:14,059
Sort of becomes sorta.

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,840
You hear that flap T, sounds more like a D in my accent.

188
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,546
There has to be some sort of problem.

189
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:30,313
Some of. 

190
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,646
Pass me some of that!

191
00:11:32,841 --> 00:11:38,724
Most of.

192
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:42,318
We finished most of the food yesterday.

193
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:46,987
Out of becomes outta.

194
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:52,240
You can hear that flapped T again in my accent, outta.

195
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:56,271
It's late. Let's get out of here.

196
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:01,501
Lots of.

197
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,316
No need to rush. We've got lots of time.

198
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:11,218
A lot of becomes alotta.

199
00:12:12,976 --> 00:12:16,196
I won't be able to make it. I've got a lot of work to do.

200
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:20,530
Now we're gonna go through some reductions for two

201
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,744
really, really common ones. Again we're using the schwa sound

202
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:29,768
so going to becomes gonna.

203
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,020
I'm not gonna make it tonight, sorry.

204
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,124
Got to.

205
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Gotta.

206
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:42,744
Again, that flap T.

207
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:45,142
It's late. We've got to get ready.

208
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:46,465
Want to.

209
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,937
Wanna.

210
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:52,235
Hear that T? It's completely gone.

211
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:53,875
Wanna.

212
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,975
I want to leave by eight.

213
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:58,156
Ought to.

214
00:12:58,742 --> 00:13:04,882
A little less common but you'll still hear it. Ought to.

215
00:13:05,444 --> 00:13:06,971
You ought to go to bed.

216
00:13:07,142 --> 00:13:11,349
That kind of sounds a lot like order, right?

217
00:13:12,277 --> 00:13:13,584
This is why it's tricky.

218
00:13:14,048 --> 00:13:20,744
You hear the verb give and let used with me all the time in English.

219
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,625
Give me or let me do something.

220
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,946
Now because these are such common expressions

221
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:31,998
and combinations, we get really lazy with the sounds.

222
00:13:32,096 --> 00:13:34,541
Give me. Let me.

223
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:38,511
So we just drop the end part of both of those verbs,

224
00:13:38,511 --> 00:13:42,144
you don't hear give me, gimme.

225
00:13:42,437 --> 00:13:44,873
I won't be long, just give me a minute.

226
00:13:44,873 --> 00:13:47,657
Let me.

227
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:49,706
Let me check that for you.

228
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:53,458
How about this one? Don't know.

229
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,331
I don't know.

230
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:01,879
I don't know what you mean.

231
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:07,464
Again because it's so common you might even see this written

232
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:08,441
dunno.

233
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:13,587
Them can sometimes be reduced right down to 'em.

234
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,475
We don't hear at all.

235
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,468
There isn't enough space for all of them.

236
00:14:19,761 --> 00:14:24,000
In the same way that them gets reduced, him and her

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,397
can often be reduced down as well so you don't hear the

238
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,164
sound.

239
00:14:29,506 --> 00:14:32,752
You might just hear: I'll get him.

240
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,617
Or I'll get her.

241
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:36,316
Because.

242
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:37,388
Do you know this one?

243
00:14:37,388 --> 00:14:40,220
How does it sound when it gets reduced down?

244
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,933
Because.

245
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:47,235
I won't make it tonight because I've got a birthday to go to.

246
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,336
Try it.

247
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,655
Because. I've got a birthday.

248
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:55,903
This little challenge is gonna be a really great way to practise

249
00:14:55,903 --> 00:15:00,369
listening and hearing the new sounds and new ways of

250
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:03,123
pronouncing the expressions that we went through today.

251
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:05,083
So get a pen and paper ready,

252
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:08,165
write them down as we go. Let's do it.

253
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,628
Are you going to come tonight?

254
00:15:10,068 --> 00:15:11,373
Do you want to buy tickets?

255
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,785
I need to check. My friend might have bought tickets already.

256
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:18,000
What about you?

257
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm going to stay in tonight because I'm really tired.

258
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,891
Spend some time with us, it's going to be fun.

259
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,606
Yeah you don't want to be thinking: I should have been there.

260
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:44,300
You're right. I don't know what I want to do anymore.

261
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,413
What do you want to do on Saturday?

262
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,400
We've got to go check out that new market.

263
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,833
I'm not going to come on Saturday.

264
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,533
I have a lot of work to do. You guys have fun though!

265
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,750
So how did you go? Do you feel pretty confident about all of those

266
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,947
expressions that you heard? If you want to check the answers,

267
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:16,506
make sure you download the PDF that I made that goes along

268
00:16:16,506 --> 00:16:17,787

00:16:17,787 --> 00:16:21,197
You can download it using the link right below in the description.

270
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:24,382

whatever you need to do to keep practising and keep reviewing

277
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:45,436
these sounds and if you want to find out more about

278
00:16:45,436 --> 00:16:48,161
connected speech and linking words,

279
00:16:48,161 --> 00:16:52,055
I've got a whole series about that and you can watch it right here.

280
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,520
I'll see you in the next lesson.
