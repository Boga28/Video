9
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:37,150
Now let's dive in with this lesson.

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,100
Are you ready to learn 15 advanced words to
help you sound fluent in English?

11
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:45,230
Let's get started with number one.

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,210
Number one, To Urge.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:52,530
The sentence structure is to urge someone
to do something.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:01,160
Urge is a verb and it means to strongly advise
or persuade someone to do something.

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,719
For example, the lawyer urged him to take
the deal.

16
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:14,509
So the lawyer strongly advised him the lawyer
tried to persuade him to take the deal.

17
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,460
The lawyer urged him to take the deal.

18
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,579
Number two, Amid.

19
00:01:21,579 --> 00:01:22,579
Amid.

20
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,259
This is a preposition.

21
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:29,069
There's an alternative spelling which is amidst,
amidst.

22
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,990
So you're adding "st" on the end.

23
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:34,770
They mean exactly the same thing.

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,909
Amid is more popular and common in American
English.

25
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,439
So that's the one I urge you to use.

26
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:50,119
Now as a preposition, this means in the middle
of or surrounded by.

27
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,100
So let me give you an example sentence.

28
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,560
Tesla launched its new car amid a lot of publicity.

29
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,820
So we have the launch of the new car.

30
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,830
Now remember, amid means in the middle of
or surrounded by so you can almost imagine

31
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:16,849
here's their launch of the new car and then
surrounded around that launch is all this

32
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,209
publicity.

33
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:21,290
Publicity is just media attention.

34
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,670
So that's when we use amid.

35
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:29,890
Tesla launch their new car amid a lot of publicity.

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,959
Number three, To Roam.

37
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,170
To Roam.

38
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,460
This is a great one.

39
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,530
You can add this to your daily vocabulary.

40
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:46,459
Because to roam, this means to move about
or travel without a clear direction of where

41
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,970
you're going.

42
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,660
But you do that on purpose.

43
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,489
You can think of it as an activity.

44
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:59,480
So when would you want to move around or move
about without a clear direction of where you're

45
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
going?

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,439
Well, probably when you're on vacation or
when you're exploring a new area, even of

47
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,260
your own city.

48
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:13,219
So you might find a new area and then you
just roam around.

49
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:17,909
You go on this street and then you see something
interesting and you go there and then you

50
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:20,360
see a store and then you go there.

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,450
You don't have a clear direction of where
you're going.

52
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,510
Number four, To Encompass.

53
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:34,170
This means that you include a lot of different
types of things for this one think of when

54
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,409
you go to a conference.

55
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,079
There are many different types of things,
right?

56
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:43,890
There are different speakers, there are different
topics.

57
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,800
There are different people in the audience.

58
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,409
There's different entertainment.

59
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,030
So all of these are different things.

60
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:58,780
Now the verb to encompass just means to include,
so we could say the conference encompasses

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:08,030
many different speakers, entertainment, audience
members, presentations, topics, and you can

62
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,510
go on and list the different categories of
things.

63
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,630
The conference encompassed many different
things.

64
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,430
Number five, Mired.

65
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,430
Mired.

66
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,910
Look at the spelling.

67
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,569
Now listen to my pronunciation, My-erd.

68
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,860
My-erd.

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,270
That's the pronunciation.

70
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:36,360
We use this when someone or something like
a company is involved in a difficult situation.

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,000
It must be a difficult situation.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,580
For example, the new company was mired in
controversy, was mired in controversy.

73
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,360
They were involved in that situation.

74
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,040
And notice I use the word controversy, which
is negative.

75
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,949
Number six, meticulously.

76
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,919
Ooh, that's a fun word to say.

77
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:00,919
Isn't it?

78
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:02,599
A little bit of a challenge for you.

79
00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:06,710
Number six, meticulously, meticulously.

80
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:13,919
This is an adjective and as an adjective it
means in a way that shows great attention

81
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,090
to detail.

82
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,590
For example, the entire project was meticulously
planned.

83
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,620
Remember, adjectives are always optional.

84
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:27,919
So I could say the entire conference was planned.

85
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,720
But now I want to give more information about
how it was planned.

86
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:39,780
And I want to say with a lot of attention
to detail the entire conference was meticulously

87
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,090
planned.

88
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,789
So this is a positive adjective is somebody
used it on you?

89
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:49,520
You would take that as a compliment.

90
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,690
Number seven, exacerbate.

91
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,580
Ooh another tricky one for pronunciation.

92
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,849
Exacerbate.

93
00:05:55,849 --> 00:05:57,129
Exacerbate.

94
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:03,110
This is when you make something that's already
bad, even worse.

95
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:10,280
We could say this attack will exacerbate the
already tense relationship between the two

96
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,750
communities.

97
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,330
So remember, it's a bad situation.

98
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:20,370
That's why I used already tense relationship
that is not a positive relationship.

99
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,580
So it's already bad, but then when you exacerbate
it means you make it even worse.

100
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,500
This attack will exacerbate their relationship.

101
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,590
Number eight, to call for.

102
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,380
This is a phrasal verb and you call for something
to happen.

103
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,430
And this is simply when you demand that something
happened.

104
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,910
For example, the union called for his resignation.

105
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,850
The union called for.

106
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,020
The union demanded.

107
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,550
The union called for his resignation.

108
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,319
Number nine, swift, swift.

109
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,319
This is an adjective.

110
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,480
It's a fun adjective because it simply means
quickly.

111
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,770
For example, the police took swift action
against the rioters.

112
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,700
Swift action, so they acted very quickly.

113
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,900
Swift action.

114
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,060
Number 10, to erode, erode.

115
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,669
This is when you slowly reduce or destroy
something.

116
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:32,780
You probably know this from a scientific perspective,
because of erosion or when rocks erode is

117
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:39,080
when rocks naturally become smaller, smaller
and smaller and smaller, because they gradually

118
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
reduce.

119
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,910
Well, the meaning is the exact same but instead
of a rock I want you to imagine trust.

120
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:54,900
Trust between two people in a business relationship
or a personal relationship as well.

121
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,069
And I could say these budget cuts could erode
the public's trust.

122
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:03,199
So we have the public's trust.

123
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,759
Just like a rock, and it's eroding, it's getting
smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller.

124
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,979
The trust is gradually decreasing.

125
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:17,780
And the reason why is because of the actions
of the person, the budget cuts.

126
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,629
The budget cuts could erode the public's trust.

127
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,699
Number 11, to highlight.

128
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:31,169
This is when you want to attract attention
to something specific or you want to emphasize

129
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:33,000
something specific.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,250
For example, the report highlighted the need
for increased safety measures.

131
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:45,610
So the report was written in a way that it
took your attention to something specific

132
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:52,610
it emphasized specific information and that
specific information is we need more safety

133
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:59,800
measures the report highlighted the need for
increased safety measures.

134
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,220
Number 12, to expose.

135
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,750
This is when you make public something bad
or something wrong.

136
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,070
So there's something wrong and most of the
time people don't want that information public

137
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,070
right.

138
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:20,930
So when you take that wrongdoing, that someone
wants to keep secret, and you make it public,

139
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:28,790
you expose, you expose that person or you
expose that action, the bad action that that

140
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,000
person took.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,029
For example, the report exposed government
corruption.

142
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,490
So there's government corruption.

143
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,320
Of course the government does not want the
public to know about it, right.

144
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,950
So when that information is made public, it's
exposed.

145
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,350
The report exposed government corruption.

146
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,899
Number 13, fundamental.

147
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:58,660
This is when something is more important than
anything else.

148
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:06,560
Fundamental, for example, it's one of the
fundamental differences between men and women.

149
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,600
So there are many differences between men
and women, obviously.

150
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,579
Remember, fundamental is more important than
anything else.

151
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:19,750
Now notice how I didn't reveal that fundamental
difference.

152
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,620
I just used "it's".

153
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,900
So you can decide what is the fundamental
difference between men and women?

154
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,160
If you want, you can try to put that in the
comments below.

155
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,990
It's the fundamental difference between men
and women, what could it be?

156
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,560
Number 14, to deploy.

157
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:46,050
And you deploy resources, resources could
be people in the form of their efforts and

158
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:52,800
the work their contribution, or it could be
money, it could be supplies, things like that.

159
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,640
And you deploy resources.

160
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,930
What does this mean?

161
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:05,269
When you deploy resources, it means you simply
use the resources but you use them in any

162
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,290
efficient way, or at least that a plan.

163
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:15,920
For example, the government is meeting to
discuss how to deploy the funds.

164
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,089
So they don't know how they're going to use
those resources in the best way.

165
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:22,360
And that's why they're meeting.

166
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,240
They're meeting to discuss how to deploy the
fund.

167
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,240
And finally, number 15, to pitch.

168
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,589
You pitch an idea or a plan.

169
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:40,570
And this simply means you share an idea or
a plan in a way that's meant to persuade,

170
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,899
persuade someone to do something specific
or to buy something.

171
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:52,930
For example, we pitched them our strategy
for how to deploy the resources.

172
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:57,300
So we have a plan, an idea, and we shared
it with you.

173
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:05,089
But we did it in a way that we want you to
say yes, we want you to accept our plan, that

174
00:12:05,089 --> 00:12:08,010
is to pitch.

175
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,760
So now you have 15 advanced words to sound
fluent in English.

176
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,649
Which one was your favorite?

177
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,519
Which one are you going to add to your vocabulary?

178
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,149
Put it in the comments below.

179
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:21,040
And then practice.

180
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,740
Practice an example sentence using your new
favorite vocabulary.

181
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,339
