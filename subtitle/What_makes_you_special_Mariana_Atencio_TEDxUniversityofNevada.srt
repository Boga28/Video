00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,810
Thank you so much.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,199
I am a journalist.

4
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,029
My job is to talk to people
from all walks of life,

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:19,919
all over the world.

6
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:21,439
Today, I want to tell you

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,740
why I decided to do this with my life
and what I've learned.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,429
My story begins in Caracas, Venezuela,

9
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:31,899
in South America, where I grew up;

10
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,000
a place that to me was,
and always will be,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,950
filled with magic and wonder.

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,070
Frоm a very young age,

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,600
my parents wanted me
to have a wider view of the world.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,350
I remember one time
when I was around seven years old,

15
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,610
my dad came up to me and said,

16
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:52,220
"Mariana, I'm going to send you
and your little sister. "

17
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:54,010
- who was six at the time -

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,629
". to a place where nobody
speaks Spanish.

19
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,440
I want you to experience
different cultures."

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,839
He went on and on about the benefits
of spending an entire summer

21
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:06,620
in this summer camp in the United States,

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,569
stressing a little phrase

23
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,699
that I didn't pay 
too much attention to at the time:

24
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:14,480
"You never know what the future holds."

25
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,480
Meanwhile, in my seven-year-old mind,

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,110
I was thinking, we were going
to get to summer camp in Miami.

27
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,050
(Laughter)

28
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,700
Maybe it was going to be even better,

29
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,910
and we were going to go
a little further north, to Orlando,

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,539
where Mickey Mouse lived.

31
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,279
(Laughter)

32
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,630
I got really excited.

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,120
My dad, however,
had a slightly different plan.

34
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,710
Frоm Caracas, he he sent us
to Brainerd, Minnesota.

35
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,070
(Laughter)

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,260
Mickey Mouse was not up there,

37
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,270
(Laughter)

38
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,830
and with no cell phone,
no Snapchat, or Instagram,

39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,940
I couldn't look up any information.

40
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,460
We got there,

41
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,289
and one of the first things I noticed

42
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,530
was that the other kids' hair
was several shades of blonde,

43
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,910
and most of them had blue eyes.

44
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,099
Meanwhile, this is what we looked like.

45
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:06,970
The first night, the camp director
gathered everyone around the campfire

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,180
and said,

47
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,910
"Kids, we have a very
international camp this year;

48
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,770
the Atencios are here from Venezuela."

49
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,910
(Laughter)

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,460
The other kids looked at us
as if we were from another planet.

51
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,750
They would ask us things like,

52
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,080
"Do you know what a hamburger is?"

53
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,880
Or, "Do you go to school
on a donkey or a canoe?"

54
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,700
(Laughter)

55
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,170
I would try to answer
in my broken English,

56
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,630
and they would just laugh.

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,780
I know they were not trying to be mean;

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,260
they were just trying
to understand who we were,

59
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,779
and make a correlation
with the world they knew.

60
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:41,870
We could either be like them,

61
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,900
or like characters out of a book
filled with adventures,

62
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,250
like Aladdin or the Jungle Book.

63
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,369
We certainly didn't look like them,

64
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,460
we didn't speak their language,

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,650
we were different.

66
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,219
When you're seven years old, that hurts.

67
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:58,469
But I had my little sister
to take care of,

68
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,060
and she cried every day at summer camp.

69
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,639
So I decided to put on a brave face,

70
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:07,400
and embrace everything I could
about the American way of life.

71
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,300
We later did what we called
"the summer camp experiment,"

72
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,260
for eight years in different cities
that many Americans haven't even heard of.

73
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,750
What I remember most about these moments
was when I finally clicked with someone.

74
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,590
Making a friend was a special reward.

75
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,900
Everybody wants to feel
valued and accepted,

76
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,870
and we think it should happen
spontaneously, but it doesn't.

77
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,790
When you're different,
you have to work at belonging.

78
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,590
You have to be either
really helpful, smart, funny,

79
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:44,730
anything to be cool for the crowd
you want to hang out with.

80
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,280
Later on, when I was in high school,

81
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,070
my dad expanded on his summer plan,

82
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,790
and from Caracas he sent me
to Wallingford, Connecticut,

83
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,760
for the senior year of high school.

84
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,030
This time, I remember
daydreaming on the plane

85
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,640
about "the American high school
experience" - with a locker.

86
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,210
It was going to be perfect,

87
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,020
just like in my favorite TV show:
"Saved by the Bell."

88
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,020
(Laughter)

89
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,499
I get there, and they tell me

90
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:14,810
that my assigned roommate
is eagerly waiting.

91
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,620
I opened the door,

92
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,750
and there she was, sitting on the bed,

93
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,460
with a headscarf.

94
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,370
Her name was Fatima,
and she was Muslim from Bahrain,

95
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,740
and she was not what I expected.

96
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,070
She probably sensed my disappointment
when I looked at her

97
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,960
because I didn't do too much to hide it.

98
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,400
See, as a teenager,
I wanted to fit in even more,

99
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,430
I wanted to be popular,

100
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,249
maybe have a boyfriend for prom,

101
00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:45,090
and I felt that Fatima just got in the way

102
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,810
with her shyness
and her strict dress code.

103
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,690
I didn't realize
that I was making her feel

104
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,230
like the kids at summer camp made me feel.

105
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,430
This was the high school
equivalent of asking her,

106
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,970
"Do you know what a hamburger is?"

107
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,540
I was consumed by my own selfishness

108
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,360
and unable to put myself in her shoes.

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,410
I have to be honest with you,

110
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,150
we only lasted a couple
of months together,

111
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,130
because she was later sent
to live with a counselor

112
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,959
instead of other students.

113
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:19,140
I remember thinking, "Ah, she'll be okay.

114
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,850
She's just different."

115
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,660
You see, when we label
someone as different,

116
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,800
it dehumanizes them in a way.

117
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,870
They become "the other."

118
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,020
They're not worthy of our time,
not our problem,

119
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,430
and in fact, they, "the other,"
are probably the cause of our problems.

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,010
So, how do we recognize our blind spots?

121
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,010
It begins by understanding
what makes you different,

122
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,130
by embracing those traits.

123
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,070
Only then can you begin to appreciate
what makes others special.

124
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,470
I remember when this hit me.

125
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,810
It was a couple months after that.

126
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:58,910
I had found that boyfriend for prom,

127
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,280
made a group of friends,

128
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,990
and practically forgotten about Fatima,

129
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,200
until everybody signed on to participate
in this talent show for charity.

130
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,180
You needed to offer a talent for auction.

131
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,190
It seemed like everybody
had something special to offer.

132
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,630
Some kids were going to play the violin,

133
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,310
others were going to recite
a theater monologue,

134
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,250
and I remember thinking,

135
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,220
"We don't practice talents
like these back home."

136
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,269
But I was determined
to find something of value.

137
00:06:27,609 --> 00:06:29,499
The day of the talent show comes,

138
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,649
and I get up on stage
with my little boom box,

139
00:06:31,649 --> 00:06:34,320
and put it on the side and press "Play,"

140
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,050
and a song by my favorite
emerging artist, Shakira, comes up.

141
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,589
And I go, "Whenever, wherever,
we're meant to be together,"

142
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:49,399
and I said, "My name is Mariana,
and I'm going to auction a dance class."

143
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,889
It seemed like the whole school
raised their hand to bid.

144
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,119
My dance class really stood out

145
00:06:56,119 --> 00:06:59,160
from, like, the 10th violin class
offered that day.

146
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,650
Going back to my dorm room,
I didn't feel different.

147
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,399
I felt really special.

148
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,269
That's when I started
thinking about Fatima,

149
00:07:08,349 --> 00:07:12,559
a person that I had failed to see
as special, when I first met her.

150
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:14,740
She was from the Middle East,

151
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,349
just like Shakira's family
was from the Middle East.

152
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,949
She could have probably taught me
a thing or two about belly dancing,

153
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,780
had I been open to it.

154
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,490
Now, I want you all to take that sticker

155
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,390
that was given to you 
at the beginning of our session today,

156
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,530
where you wrote down
what makes you special,

157
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,299
and I want you to look at it.

158
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:34,799
If you're watching at home,
take a piece of paper,

159
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:37,369
and write down what makes you different.

160
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:40,360
You may feel guarded when you look at it,

161
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,339
maybe even a little ashamed,
maybe even proud.

162
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:46,409
But you need to begin to embrace it.

163
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:51,910
Remember, it is the first step
in appreciating what makes others special.

164
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,049
When I went back home to Venezuela,

165
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:59,609
I began to understand
how these experiences were changing me.

166
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:02,880
Being able to speak different languages,

167
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,750
to navigate all these
different people and places,

168
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,590
it gave me a unique sensibility.

169
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,750
I was finally beginning to understand

170
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,359
the importance of putting myself
in other people's shoes.

171
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:21,040
That is a big part of the reason
why I decided to become a journalist.

172
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:26,130
Especially being from a part of the world
that is often labeled "the backyard,"

173
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,020
"the illegal aliens,"
"third-world," "the others,"

174
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:32,179
I wanted to do something to change that.

175
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,609
It was right around the time, however,

176
00:08:34,609 --> 00:08:36,960
when the Venezuelan government shut down

177
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,150
the biggest television station
in our country.

178
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,427
Censorship was growing,

179
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,668
and my dad came up to me
once again and said,

180
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:47,000
"How are you going to be
a journalist here?

181
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,850
You have to leave."

182
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,949
That's when it hit me.

183
00:08:51,349 --> 00:08:54,069
That's what he had been preparing me for.

184
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:56,970
That is what the future held for me.

185
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,969
So in 2008, I packed my bags,
and I came to the United States,

186
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,859
without a return ticket this time.

187
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:10,049
I was painfully aware
that, at 24 years old,

188
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:15,340
I was becoming a refugee of sorts,
an immigrant, the other,

189
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,410
once again, and now for good.

190
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:22,920
I was able to come on a scholarship
to study journalism.

191
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,300
I remember when they gave me
my first assignment

192
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,490
to cover the historic election
of President Barack Obama.

193
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,500
I felt so lucky, so hopeful.

194
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,210
I was, like, "Yes, this is it.

195
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,670
I've come to post-racial America,

196
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,760
where the notion of us and them
is being eroded,

197
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,759
and will probably
be eradicated in my lifetime."

198
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:48,450
Boy, was I wrong, right?

199
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,100
Why didn't Barack Obama's presidency
alleviate racial tensions in our country?

200
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,899
Why do some people still feel threatened

201
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:00,129
by immigrants, LGBTQ, and minority groups

202
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,649
who are just trying to find a space

203
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,569
in this United States
that should be for all of us?

204
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,090
I didn't have the answers back then,

205
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,580
but on November 8th, 2016,

206
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,029
when Donald Trump became
our president, it became clear

207
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,750
that a large part of the electorate
sees them as "the others."

208
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,819
Some see people coming to take their jobs,

209
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:24,869
or potential terrorists
who speak a different language.

210
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:31,550
Meanwhile, minority groups oftentimes
just see hatred, intolerance,

211
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:34,149
and narrow-mindedness on the other side.

212
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:38,379
It's like we're stuck in these bubbles
that nobody wants to burst.

213
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:42,400
The only way to do it,
the only way to get out of it

214
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,500
is to realize that being different
also means thinking differently.

215
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,490
It takes courage to show respect.

216
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,830
In the words of Voltaire:

217
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,540
"I may not agree
with what you have to say,

218
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,500
but I will fight to the death
to defend your right to say it."

219
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,280
Failing to see anything good
on the other side

220
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,550
makes a dialogue impossible.

221
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,230
Without a dialogue, we will keep
repeating the same mistakes,

222
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,090
because we will not learn anything new.

223
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,390
I covered the 2016 election for NBC News.

224
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,540
It was my first big assignment
in this mainstream network,

225
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,470
where I had crossed over
from Spanish television.

226
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,860
And I wanted to do something different.

227
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,100
I watched election results
with undocumented families.

228
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,360
Few thought of sharing that moment
with people who weren't citizens,

229
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,790
but actually stood
the most to lose that night.

230
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,020
When it became apparent
that Donald Trump was winning,

231
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,240
this eight-year-old girl named Angelina
rushed up to me in tears.

232
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,860
She sobbed, and she asked me
if her mom was going to be deported now.

233
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:57,410
I hugged her back and I said,
"It's going to be okay,"

234
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,820
but I really didn't know.

235
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,760
This was the photo we took that night,
forever ingrained in my heart.

236
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,820
Here was this little girl

237
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,520
who was around the same age I was
when I went to camp in Brainerd.

238
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,580
She already knows she is "the other."

239
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,970
She walks home from school
in fear, every day,

240
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,160
that her mom can be taken away.

241
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,990
So, how do we put ourselves
in Angelina's shoes?

242
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,770
How do we make her
understand she is special,

243
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,440
and not simply unworthy
of having her family together?

244
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,120
By giving camera time to her
and families like hers,

245
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,040
I tried to make people see them
as human beings,

246
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,060
and not simply "illegal aliens."

247
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,910
Yes, they broke a law, 
and they should pay a penalty for it,

248
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,210
but they've also given
everything for this country,

249
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,730
like many other immigrants
before them have.

250
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,600
I've already told you how my path
to personal growth started.

251
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,740
To end, I want to tell you how I hit
the worst bump in the road yet,

252
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,710
one that shook me to my very core.

253
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,440
The day, April 10th, 2014,

254
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,430
I was driving to the studio,
and I got a call from my parents.

255
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,790
"Are you on the air?" they asked.

256
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,950
I immediately knew something was wrong.

257
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,680
"What happened?" I said.

258
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:23,460
"It's your sister;
she's been in a car accident."

259
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,000
It was as if my heart stopped.

260
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,480
My hands gripped the steering wheel,

261
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,350
and I remember hearing the words:

262
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,480
"It is unlikely she will ever walk again."

263
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,360
They say your life can change
in a split second.

264
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,530
Mine did at that moment.

265
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,040
My sister went from being
my successful other half,

266
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,930
only a year apart in age,

267
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,030
to not being able to move her legs,

268
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,400
sit up, or get dressed by herself.

269
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,680
This wasn't like summer camp,
where I could magically make it better.

270
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,730
This was terrifying.

271
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,420
Throughout the course of two years,
my sister underwent 15 surgeries,

272
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,160
and she spent the most
of that time in a wheelchair.

273
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:14,410
But that wasn't even the worst of it.

274
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:20,250
The worst was something so painful,
it's hard to put into words, even now.

275
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,110
It was the way people looked at her,

276
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,560
looked at us, changed.

277
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,650
People were unable to see
a successful lawyer

278
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,940
or a millennial with a sharp wit
and a kind heart.

279
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,220
Everywhere we went,

280
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,900
I realized that people just saw
a poor girl in a wheelchair.

281
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,378
They were unable to see
anything beyond that.

282
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,390
After fighting like a warrior,

283
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,700
I can thankfully tell you
that today my sister is walking,

284
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,140
and has recovered
beyond anyone's expectations.

285
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,760
(Applause)

286
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:00,940
Thank you.

287
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,150
But during that traumatic ordeal,

288
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,930
I learned there are differences
that simply suck,

289
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,329
and it's hard to find positive in them.

290
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:14,309
My sister's not better off
because of what happened.

291
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:21,020
But she taught me: you can't let
those differences define you.

292
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:27,380
Being able to reimagine yourself
beyond what other people see,

293
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,289
that is the toughest task of all,

294
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,979
but it's also the most beautiful.

295
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:37,049
You see, we all come
to this world in a body.

296
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:40,900
People with physical
or neurological difficulties,

297
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,490
environmentally impacted communities,
immigrants, boys, girls,

298
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:50,110
boys who want to dress as girls,
girls with veils,

299
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,730
women who have been sexually assaulted,

300
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,500
athletes who bend
their knee as a sign of protest,

301
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,530
black, white, Asian, Native American,
my sister, you, or me.

302
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,570
We all want what everyone wants:
to dream and to achieve.

303
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,319
But sometimes, society tells us,
and we tell ourselves,

304
00:16:11,369 --> 00:16:13,109
we don't fit the mold.

305
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:16,860
Well, if you look at my story,

306
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,199
from being born somewhere different,
to belly dancing in high school,

307
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:24,259
to telling stories
you wouldn't normally see on TV,

308
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:26,830
what makes me different

309
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,650
is what has made me
stand out and be successful.

310
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,700
I have traveled the world,

311
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,249
and talked to people
from all walks of life.

312
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:38,599
You know what I've learned?

313
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:44,940
The single thing every one of us
has in common is being human.

314
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,680
So take a stand to defend
your race, the human race.

315
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,770
Let's appeal to it.

316
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,170
Let's be humanists,
before and after everything else.

317
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,330
To end, I want you to take that sticker,
that piece of paper

318
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,590
where you wrote down
what makes you different,

319
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,719
and I want you to celebrate it
today and every day,

320
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:09,078
shout it from the rooftops.

321
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,270
I also encourage you
to be curious and ask,

322
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,530
"What is on other people's
pieces of paper?"

323
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,750
"What makes them different?"

324
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,429
Let's celebrate those imperfections
that make us special.

325
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:27,559
I hope that it teaches you that nobody
has a claim on the word "normal."

326
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,700
We are all different.

327
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,110
We are all quirky, and unique,

328
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,420
and that is what makes us
wonderfully human.

329
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,030
Thank you so much.

330
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,669
(Applause)
