00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,210
- Hello, lovely students,

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,810
and welcome back to "English with Lucy."

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,490
Today's video is perfect for you

4
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,300
if you're looking to improve
your business English

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,330
or your professional English.

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,199
Today, my husband is going to ask me

7
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,199
100 of the most common
business English questions.

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,310
I'm going to give genuine answers

9
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,760
so that you can learn real English.

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,880
As always, there is a free PDF

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,700
that goes with today's video.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,350
It's got all of the questions

13
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,620
so you can use them to practise yourself,

14
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,090
plus a transcript of my answers

15
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,450
and extra information and activities.

16
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,230
If you'd like to download that PDF,

17
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,610

my free weekly lesson PDFs

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,600
along with all my news,
course offers, and updates.

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,030
Hey, future Lucy here.

25
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,660
I wanted to tell you about
something really exciting

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,890
that I've been working
on for quite a while.

27
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,580
I know that lots of you
want to improve your English

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,240
in order to get a job

29
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,780
or improve your career prospects.

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,280
I also know that lots of you have an aim

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,940
to sound professional and experienced

32
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,850
when you speak,

33
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:19,260
nearly all of you want to use vocabulary

34
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,640
that is appropriate and
relevant for the work place.

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,600
Those are the reasons why I have created

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,130
my 30-Day Business English Challenge.

37
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,700
This Business English challenge

38
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,660
will teach you to speak and understand

39
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,660
professional English in context

40
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,160
using a really fun, interesting,

41
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,350
and effective methodology

42
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,110
that will help you to retain and remember

43
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,050
what you've learned.

44
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,900
In the challenge, we cover 10 topics,

45
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,860
each topic lasts for three days,

46
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,180
and in those three days,

47
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,760
I will teach you between 22 and 40

48
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,720
new vocabulary words and phrases,

49
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,550
business vocabulary.

50
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,660
Every three days,

51
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,910
you get two video days
and one listening day,

52
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,810
so that's two reading
and vocabulary video days

53
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,400
and one listening practise day.

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,570
On the reading and vocabulary days,

55
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,980
I read you a text

56
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,120
that contains lots of relevant vocabulary.

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,570
We then discuss all of the vocabulary,

58
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,440
their meanings, examples,
how you use them.

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,860
Because you're listening
to me reading the texts,

60
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,210
you're not only improving your vocabulary

61
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,910
but also your pronunciation.

62
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,020
On each of these days,

63
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,410
you also receive 20 exercise questions

64
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,540
testing you on the vocabulary
that you've just learned

65
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,930
and importantly,

66
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,090
the vocabulary that you've
learned in previous days.

67
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,790
This is really important

68
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,220
for helping you to remember
and retain at vocab.

69
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,920
You also have extra reading opportunities

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,330
discussing English workplace culture.

71
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,510
On the listening days, you'll participate

72
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,440
in some amazingly effective
listening exercises

73
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,090
using the vocabulary you've just learned

74
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,930
so it'll be further
cementing it in your brain.

75
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,930
Every day for the 30-day challenge,

76
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,950
you can access the comment section

77
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,830
and ask questions to me and my teachers,

78
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,260
and we can give you feedback.

79
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,930
By the end of the 30 days,

80
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,870
you will have learned over
280 new vocabulary phrases,

81
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,150
including idioms, phrasal verbs,

82
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,090
collocations, slang terms, you name it.

83
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,400
You'll have taken over
400 vocabulary exercises

84
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
and 230 listening exercises.

85
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,470
Imagine the progress that you'll make

86
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,100
in just 30 days.

87
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,933
But don't worry,

88
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:41,120
if 30 days is too intense for you

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,010
or you can't start immediately,

90
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,300
you have lifetime access
to the course content.

91
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,310
Once you buy it, it's yours to keep.

92
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,270
Another nice feature

93
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,700
is that when you complete the course,

94
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,900
you get a digital
certificate of completion.

95
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,680
Previous challenge
students love to use this

96
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,080
alongside their CV

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,590
to prove that they've taken

98
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,370
a certain amount of classes.

99
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,143
Now, the price of this
Business English Challenge

100
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:08,790
will be $129 plus taxes.

101
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,060
However, as it's new,

102
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,800
I'm doing a special introductory offer

103
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,350
and it's a big discount. (chuckles)

104
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,063
You can save $40, taking
the price down to $89

105
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,680
plus your country's tax.

106
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,680
If you want to claim this discount,

107
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,453
you have to apply the code 40BIZYT.

108
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,980
There is a deadline.

109
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,210
The challenge starts
on the 1st of May 2022

110
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,790
and after that first day,

111
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,770
the code will expire and
enrollment will close.

112
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,720
Thousands and thousands of students

113
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,650
have participated in
my previous challenges

114
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,230
and they have the most amazing feedback.

115
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,450
It has been wonderful meeting them all.

116
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,700
I love having that
smaller group of students

117
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,590
that I can talk to,

118
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,350
I can recognise their names.

119
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,600
Don't miss out.

120
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,460
Sign up before the 1st of May,

121
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:03,160
invest in yourself,

122
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,250
and enjoy the benefits of the
Business English Challenge.

123
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,050
Right, let's get started
with the questions.

124
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,690
- [Will] Where do you work?

125
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,840
- I work for teaching company.

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,670

00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,150
- CEO.

128
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,750
- [Will] Do you like your job?

129
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,350
- I love my job.

130
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,510

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:26,400

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,810
- [Will] How many days a week do you work?

133
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,100
- Five to seven.

134
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,460
- [Will] Do you have a boss?

135
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,620
- I am my boss, but I
work with my husband.

00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,420
Sometimes, he bosses me around.

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,650
- [Will] What was your first job?

138
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,180

you never, ever do?

140
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,820
- I don't think I'd like to be a chef.

141
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,220
It's too much pressure.

142
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,610
- [Will] Would you like a new job?

143
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,580
- No, I'm really happy with this one.

144

- [Will] Would you recommend
your line of work to others?

145
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,940
- If you enjoy teaching,

146
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,520
then I think it's a fabulous career path.

147
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,670
- [Will] What did you do this weekend?

148
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,790
- This weekend, we did
a little bit of work

149
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,070
in the morning, and then we relaxed.

150
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,210
- [Will] What will you do after work?

151
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,800
- Well, it's quite late right now.

152
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,960
I think we'll eat dinner and go to bed.

153
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,530
- [Will] How was traffic today?

154
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,630
- I didn't drive today.

155
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,800
I work from home.

156
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,850

157
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,200

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,220
- Relax, explore, and
hopefully visit some vineyards.

160
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,970
- [Will] Any plans for the weekend?

161
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,760
- This weekend, it's Easter

162
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,490
and we're going to see our families.

163
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,070
- [Will] What will you do for lunch?

164
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:34,800
- Normally, I have a salad for lunch.

165
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,180
- [Will] Would you like
to go to lunch with me?

166
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,190
- With you?

167
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,070
Every day. (chuckles)

168
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,600
- [Will] Are you working late tonight?

169
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,900
- Yes. I'm working unusually late tonight.

170
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,190
- [Will] What time did
you clock in this morning?

171
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,700
- I started work at
around 8:30 this morning.

172
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,800
- [Will] Did you find a good parking spot?

173
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,799
- I didn't have to park.

174
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,180
(chuckles) I work from home.

175
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,280
- [Will] What time do
you get home from work?

176
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,360
- I normally try to finish working

177
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,320
at around five to six o'clock.

178
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,890
- [Will] How do you get to work?

179
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,560
- I leave my bed, go downstairs,

180
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,400
and sit down at the table.

181
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,610
- [Will] Would you get
public transport to work?

182
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,960
- If I didn't work from home,

183
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,060
I would absolutely get
public transport to work.

184
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,350
- [Will] How are your kids?

185
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,570
- I don't have any, yet. (chuckles)

186
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,370
- [Will] Do you ever work overtime?

187
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,360
- Yes. I think it's the nature
of running your own business.

188
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,050
- [Will] How many meetings
do you attend in a week?

189
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,400
- Probably 7 to 10.

190
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,090

191
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:36,410

192
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,240
- [Will] Do you think
the company is run well?

193
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,170
- I hope so. (chuckles)

194
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,210
- [Will] How long have
you been working here?

195
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,890
- I started this business in January 2016.

196
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,710
So is that six years?

197
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,600
- [Will] Have you received a promotion?

198
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,220
- No. I've always been the CEO. (laughs)

199
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,000
- [Will] How often do you get a raise?

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,600
- I like to pay myself
slightly more each year.

201
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,300
- [Will] How well do you
get on with your boss?

202
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,820
- With my business partner, my husband?

203
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,930
Extremely well.

204
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,100
- [Will] Do you get on
with your coworkers?

205
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,460
- I have a lovely team.

206
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,330
- [Will] What does your
average day look like?

207
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:21,330
- I like to break up my day
with exercise and dog walks.

208
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,150
- [Will] Would you change
anything about your daily routine?

209
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,770

210
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,860
- [Will] Do you get to travel for work?

211
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,520
- Before the pandemic,
I travelled quite a lot.

212
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,490
It's starting to pick up now.

213
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,799
- [Will] What is the most
challenging part of your job?

214
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,499
- Receiving criticism from strangers.

215
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,320
- [Will] Do you have to
work at the weekends?

216
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,500
- Sometimes I do.

217
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,160
In fact, oftentimes I do.

218
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,660
- [Will] Does management support you?

219
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,483
- My husband is very supportive.

220
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,310
- [Will] How did you find this job?

221
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,230
- I think I was very lucky

222
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,160
and a bit lost as a 21-year-old.

223
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,120
- [Will] Are you interested in a full-time

224
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,130
or a part-time position?

225
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,440
- I enjoy working in a full-time position,

226
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,180
but one day, I might like to move

227
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,010
to a part-time position.

228
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,760
- [Will] Did you bring your CV?

229
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,593
- Do you know what?

230
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,900
I don't have a CV or a resume.

231
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,400
Maybe I should make one.

232
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,850

233
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,270

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,940
- My last job was an English teacher.

238
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,370
- [Will] How long did you work there?

239
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,650
- I worked as an English
teacher for three years

240
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,800
before starting my business.

241
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,090
- [Will] Why did you leave your last job?

242
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,060
- It was a natural progression.

243
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,470
- [Will] Do you have references?

244
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,290
- I'm sure I could ask some
of my previous bosses for you.

245
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,730
- [Will] Do you work well with others?

246
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,040
- I'd like to think I do,

247
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,970
but I do like being alone.

248
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,390
- [Will] Can you work in a group setting?

249
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,890
- I can, but I'd prefer not to.

250
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:00,250

251
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,250

252
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,100

- Sometimes I get a bit stressed.

254
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,360
- [Will] Have you always worked
in the education industry?

255
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,150
- No, before I was a teacher,

256
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,080
I worked in marketing.

257
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,770
- [Will] Do you like to work outdoors?

258
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,830
- No, because the wind

259
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,174
makes an awful noise with my camera.

260
00:10:19,174 --> 00:10:21,680
- [Will] Are you an organised person?

261
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,530
- In my work life, yes.

262
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,223
In my personal life, no.

263
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,820

265
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,650
a fantastic intermediate English course.

266
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,800
- [Will] What are your long-term goals?

267
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,120
- To live a happy life.

268
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,010
- [Will] Why should we hire you?

269
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,870
- I think I'm proactive,
creative, and enthusiastic.

270
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,490
- [Will] When can you start?

271
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,030
- Immediately!

272
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,530

- Yes, I can use that quite well.

276
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,810

in using spreadsheet software?

277
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,670
- Yes, I have quite a lot of
experience using spreadsheets.

278
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,320
- [Will] How fast can you type?

279
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,950
- Very quickly!

280
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,580
- [Will] What other software
are you familiar with?

281
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,530
- You name it; I've probably tried it.

282
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,050
- [Will] Do you own a laptop?

283
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,200
- I do! Grey. (laughs)

284
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,070
- [Will] Are you comfortable
using social media?

285
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,803
- Oh, I guess so.

286
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:26,850
- [Will] Have you managed
a social media account?

287
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,300
- Yes, I've managed
quite a few in my time.

288
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,960
- [Will] Can you edit videos?

289
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,020
- Yes, I started off
editing my own videos.

290
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,430
- [Will] Have you ever used Photoshop?

291
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,830
- I have. I wouldn't say
it's my biggest strength.

292
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,620
- [Will] How do you plan your days?

293
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,160
- I use Google Calendar,

294
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,870
and I put everything I need to do in it.

295
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,950
- [Will] How are you with time management?

296
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,200

297
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,840
- [Will] Do you always
meet your deadlines?

298
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,053
- Not always, but I try my best.

299
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,680
- [Will] Are you
comfortable asking for help?

300
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,940
- I always ask for help.

301
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,730
- [Will] Do you like helping people?

302
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,530
- Yes, It's my job! (laughs)

303
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,180
- [Will] Do you often feel overwhelmed?

304
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,680
- I sometimes feel overwhelmed,

305
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,690
but I think I'm quite good at managing it.

306
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:16,760
- [Will] Do you consider
yourself to be a good leader?

307
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,810
- I'm new to being a leader,

308
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:20,520
and I'm learning a lot.

309
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,780
- [Will] How do you balance
your work and personal life?

310
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,610
- With a bit of difficulty,
but I'm working on it.

311
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,080
- [Will] How do you prioritise tasks?

312
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,250
- When's the nearest deadline?

313
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,330
- [Will] How do you handle stress at work?

314
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,520
- I go on a dog walk,

315
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,053
and I talk to my husband.

316
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,130
- [Will] Are you optimistic?

317
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,060
- I'd say I'm very optimistic,

318
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,910
sometimes too optimistic.

319
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,350
- [Will] Do you enjoy public speaking?

320
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:47,270
- I don't enjoy the build-up,

321
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,740
but I enjoy having done it.

322
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,400
- [Will] Do you finish what you start?

323
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,540
- Not always.

324
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,950
If I don't see some
something as going somewhere,

325
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,660
then why finish it?

326
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,930
- [Will] Would your friends
describe you as trustworthy?

327
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,830
- Yes, I think most of my friends

328
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,590
would describe me as trustworthy.

329
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,790
- [Will] Is your personality
suited for this job?

330
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,720
- I think so.

331
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,880
Otherwise, I would've given up

332
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,830
- [Will] What makes a good friend?

333
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,410
- I think good friends are people

334
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,800
that you can go a long
time without seeing,

335
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,810
but you see each other,

336
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:21,253
and it's like no time has passed at all.

337
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,220
- [Will] Are you easy to anger?

338
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,570
- No, but if you repeatedly disappoint me,

339
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,440
then I will become angry.

340
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,060
- [Will] What makes you angry?

341
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,430
- Bad customer service

342
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,910
and overpromising and underdelivering.

343
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,920
- [Will] Is there an
absolute right and wrong?

344
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,480
- Hardly ever.

345
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,470
- [Will] Do you pay your bills on time?

346
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,980
- I always pay my bills on time.

347
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,460
- [Will] Do you prefer variety or routine?

348
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,883
- I like a bit of both,

349
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,260
but probably more of a routine.

350
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,570
- [Will] Do you prefer to work
quickly or focus on details?

351
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,280
- It depends what I'm doing,

352
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,960
but in general, I prefer to work quickly.

353
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,320
- [Will] Is it ever okay to lie?

354
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,563
- Yes, it's sometimes okay to lie

355
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:11,100
if it stops people from
having their feelings hurt.

356
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,440

are important in a boss?

357

358
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,930
the ability to teach, and
the ability to praise.

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,640

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,650
- I really admire Marcia Kilgore.

363
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,740
- [Will] Describe yourself in one word.

364
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,010
- Happy.

365
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,860

367
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,400
that helps people around the world.

368
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,580
- [Will] If you could have
dinner and talk with anyone,

369
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,900
who would it be?

370
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,110
- Probably Phoebe Waller-Bridge.

371
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,230
She seems hilarious.

372
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,180
- [Will] If you could go back

373
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,050
and change anything in your life,

374
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,240
what would it be?

375
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,600
- I don't think I would change anything

376
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,540
because I'm happy with how
everything is right now.

377
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,690
- [Will] Your email address?

378
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:05,650
- Email address?

379
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,754
- [Will] Would you like to
carpool karaoke (indistinct),

380
00:15:08,754 --> 00:15:10,180
all right?

381
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,480
24, would you like to carpool with me?

382
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,172
- Did you say karaoke automatically?

383
00:15:15,172 --> 00:15:16,005
- [Will] Yeah,

384
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:18,300
because that's how it ends.
(Lucy laughing)

385
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,550
Didn't it?
- That's so random.

386
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,430
No, carpooling is like
sharing cars to work.

387
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,387
- [Will] Oh, I thought
it was carpool karaoke.

388
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:28,388
Whatever!
(Lucy laughing)

389
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:31,149
Once you're sharing your
(laughter drowns out Will).

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,623
- [Will] Why should we hire you?

392
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,143
- Why should you hire me?

393
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,581
Creating a business, business. (laughs)

394
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:44,414
(Will laughs)

00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:47,521
