1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,410
There's a saying in English

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,740
that one of the only things

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,940
that remains the same in life,

4
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,400
one of the only things
that is constant is change.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,710
Things change.

6
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,185
It's fall here in Ontario, Canada,

7
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:14,080
and as you can see, the
leaves are changing color.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,129
Everything around me is changing.

9
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:17,640
So I thought this would be a good time

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,960
to do an English lesson about change.

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,910
So stick around for this English lesson,

12
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,340
I'll help you learn about
10 different English phrases

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,780
that we use to talk about all kinds

14
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,260
of different changes that happen in life.

15
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,093
(cheerful music)

16
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:37,440
The first phrase I wanted to
teach you to talk about change

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,870
is the phrase like night and day.

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,870
We use this phrase to talk about something

19
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,790
that's changed quite a bit.

20
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,070
The best example I can give you is this.

21
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,660
Sometimes my kids have messy rooms.

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,300
They leave everything on the
floor and it's a real mess.

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,247
And then I tell them on a Saturday,

24
00:00:53,247 --> 00:00:54,441
"You need to clean your room

25
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:57,220
or you can't play computer
games later today."

26
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,540
And then they clean their room.

27
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,970
And then the difference between
when their room was messy

28
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,709
and when their room is
clean is like night and day.

29
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,680
The difference is so great

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,997
that I would walk in the room and say,

31
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:10,530
"Wow, the difference,
it's like night and day.

32
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,890
It's so much nicer when
your room is clean."

33
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,610
So when you say that something
is like night and day,

34
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,620
you mean that it's changed so much

35
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,810
that it looks completely different now.

36
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,210
The next phrase I wanted
to teach you is a phrase

37
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,910
that we use to describe when
someone's appearance changes,

38
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,211
and it's the phrase to
barely recognize someone.

39
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:31,500
Now, this phrase, I
actually saw in the comments

40
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,130
in a video a number of months ago.

41
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,700
Because I shaved off my
beard and my mustache,

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,750
and then when I made a video
with no beard or mustache,

43
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,487
in the comments, a few people said,

44
00:01:41,487 --> 00:01:43,660
"I barely recognized you."

45
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,840
What they were saying is that

46
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,570
because my appearance had changed so much,

47
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:50,520
it was hard for them to tell
that I was Bob, the Canadian.

48
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,380
They thought maybe I was another person,

49
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,970
or maybe I was Bob's brother or something,

50
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,321
but it was actually me.

51
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:58,630
Now, be careful when you use this phrase,

52
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,417
because you don't want to use it

53
00:02:00,417 --> 00:02:02,420
in a way that sounds negative.

54
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,835
You might wanna add a positive phrase

55
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,650
before you use this phrase

56
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:08,610
because it can be misinterpreted.

57
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,567
So you could say something like this.

58
00:02:10,567 --> 00:02:12,930
"Oh, I can tell you've been exercising.

59
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,464
You look amazing. I
barely recognized you."

60
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:18,480
Or, "Wow, your new haircut looks great.

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,180
I barely recognized you."

62
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,610
So when you use this phrase,
you're simply talking

63
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,390
about how someone's
appearance has changed.

64
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,560
Hi, Bob, the Canadian here,

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,450
just jumping into the
middle of this lesson

66
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,496
to ask you to do one thing, actually two.

69
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,060
And if this video is helping you learn

70
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,186
a little bit of English,
please give me a thumbs up.

71
00:02:39,186 --> 00:02:40,970
Now, back to the lesson.

72
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,310
I don't know if you've noticed this,

73
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,556
but sometimes kids go
through a growth spurt,

74
00:02:44,556 --> 00:02:47,170
and we use the phrase to grow like a weed

75
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,970
to describe this change.

76
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,920
A weed is a plant that grows
in a garden or a field,

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,490
and it's a plant you don't want there,

78
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,490
and they usually grow
really, really quickly.

79
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,810
So we use this comparison to
talk about how fast kids grow.

80
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:00,840
Maybe you have a nephew

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,766
or a niece who you haven't
seen for a year or two

82
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,977
and the next time you
see them, you could say,

83
00:03:04,977 --> 00:03:07,610
"Wow, you're growing like a weed.

84
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,520
You're so much taller now."

85
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,590
In fact, at some point they
might even be taller than you.

86
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,340
That's happened to me with a
few of my nephews and nieces

87
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,090
in the last year or two.

88
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,960
I'm starting to feel a little bit short.

89
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,580
So when you're describing a
child who is growing quickly

90
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,540
or a child who you
haven't seen for a while

91
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,717
and they're much taller
now, you could say to them,

92
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,820
"Wow, you're growing like a weed."

93
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,140
The English phrase to
change your tune means

94
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,300
to change your behavior,
usually in a positive direction.

95
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,200
Sometimes people do bad things.

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,280
Sometimes people do things
that they're not supposed to do

97
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,230
and you wish that they
would change their tune.

98
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,140
I have this sometimes in my classroom.

99
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,630
Sometimes I have students who don't listen

100
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,860
and they misbehave,
and just day after day,

101
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,980
their behavior is not very good.

102
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,216
Their behavior is bad.

103
00:03:54,216 --> 00:03:56,980
So I wish that they
would change their tune.

104
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,500
I might even say to them, "You know what?

105
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,818
You need to change your tune

106
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:02,210
if you want to do well in this class.

107
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,440
If you want to succeed, you
need to change your tune."

108
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,700
So the English phrase to
change your tune means

109
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,060
to change your behavior in a way

110
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,120
that you are now doing things
in a more positive way.

111
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,000
Instead of doing bad things,
you're doing good things.

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,079
The next two English phrases about change

113
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,359
have the same meaning.

114
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,880
They are the phrases to do a 180

115
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,090
and to have a change of heart.

116
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,790
The best example I can
give for these two phrases

117
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,320
is if you think about
a professional athlete

118
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,104
who announced their retirement,

119
00:04:32,104 --> 00:04:34,670
an athlete who decided not to play anymore

120
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,640
because they thought they
were getting too old,

121
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,930
and then after being
retired for a little while,

122
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,210
they decide to come back,
they decide to play again.

123
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,210
In that situation,

124
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,760
we would say that the player did a 180.

125
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,920
They've reversed their decision.

126
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,400
Or we would say that the
player had a change of heart;

127
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,290
they reversed their decision.

128
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,480
So instead of doing what
they were going to do,

129
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,620
instead of doing what they decided to do,

130
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,200
they've decided to reverse their decision

131
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,500
and come back and play again.

132
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,090
It's always cool when your
favorite athlete retires

133
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,760
and then does a 180 or
has a change of heart

134
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,140
and decides to play again.

135
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,420
This next English phrase
is a phrase we use

136
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,400
to talk about the change
in someone's appearance,

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,210
and it's a phrase that we use maybe

138
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,420
to bug someone a little
bit or in a humorous way,

139
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,200
and it's the phrase to clean up nicely.

140
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,610
Sometimes Jen and I
have to go to a wedding,

141
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,860
and so I get a haircut

142
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,290
and I shave my beard or trim my beard,

143
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,877
and I put on a suit and
tie, and Jen will then say,

144
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:31,240
"Wow, you clean up nicely."

145
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,980
And what she's talking about is the change

146
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,830
from how I normally look

147
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,350
to how I look after I get a haircut,

148
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,364
and trim my beard, and
put on a suit and tie

149
00:05:40,364 --> 00:05:42,600
makes me look really, really good.

150
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,650
So, remember, this is a phrase you use

151
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,140
with someone you know well.

152
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,300
It's a phrase you use

153
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,210
to kinda jokingly give
someone a compliment,

154
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,887
I hope that makes sense,
but you would say,

155
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:54,350
"Wow, you clean up nicely."

156
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,530
Hi, I thought I should pop into the lesson

157
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,830
with my suit and tie on just to show you

158
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,240
that I do actually clean up nicely.

159
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,760
The English phrase out with
the old, in with the new

160
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,908
is a phrase we use to talk about change

161
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:10,087
in almost any situation when
we think change is important.

162
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:11,670
I don't know if you noticed,

163
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,920
but the intro to my English lessons

164
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,330
on YouTube changed about
a month and a half ago

165
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,300
because it was time

166
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,890
to make it look a little
more fresh and new.

167
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,030
It was time for me to get rid of the old

168
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,630
and bring in something new.

169
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,607
The way I would describe
that is I would say,

170
00:06:25,607 --> 00:06:28,210
"You know, out with the
old, in with the new.

171
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,830
It was time to make a change

172
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,260
so that things would look
just a little bit better."

173
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,620
So when you say out with
the old, in with the new,

174
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,920
it's used any time you want
to talk about the reason

175
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,580
why you're changing something.

176
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,997
If someone at work was saying,

177
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:42,310
"Why are we doing it this way now?"

178
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,650
You could say, "You
know, out with the old,

179
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,610
in with the new.

180
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,020
We have to keep up with the times."

181
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,840
Sometimes you need to make
changes to stay current.

182
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,076
So, out with the old, in with the new.

183
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:54,640
Have you ever had a job
that you didn't like?

184
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,120
Or maybe there's a room in your house

185
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,300
and you just don't like how it looks?

186
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,860
You might use this English phrase

187
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,060
to describe either of those situations.

188
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,600
You might say it's time for a change.

189
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,610
In English when you say
it's time for a change,

190
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,470
it means that you want
to change your situation

191
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,470
or you want to change
something to look more pleasing

192
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,110
or just to be more pleasing.

193
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,590
So the best example would
probably be the job.

194
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,460
Sometimes people work at a
certain job for a long time

195
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,010
and then they start to not enjoy it.

196
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,957
And then the best phrase to
describe that would be to say,

197
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:26,440
"It's time for a change."

198
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,517
In fact, you might have a
friend in that situation

199
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:29,537
and you might say to them,

200
00:07:29,537 --> 00:07:31,660
"Hey, I know you've been complaining

201
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,370
about your job a lot lately,
maybe it's time for a change.

202
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,770
Maybe it's time for you to
look for a different job.

203
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,950
That might make you happy."

204
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,360
The English phrase to
shake things up means

205
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,380
to do something differently
than how you have been doing it.

206
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,650
Here's a good example.

207
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,400
My sister and brother-in-law

208
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,850
go to the same campground every year,

209
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,830
but this year when they went camping,

210
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,600
they decided to shake things up.

211
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,856
They decided to go to a
completely different campground.

212
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:00,260
We use this phrase when we decide

213
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,870
to do something differently
than how we've been doing it.

214
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,596
Maybe you've become bored with
doing something the same way.

215
00:08:06,596 --> 00:08:09,070
Maybe you've become bored with the place

216
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,090
where you've been going.

217
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,370
Maybe you've become bored

218
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,170
with the kind of food you've been eating,

219
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:15,070
and then you decide to shake things up.

220
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,000
You decide to change how you do something

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,550
so it's a little more exciting.

222
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,490
A long time ago,

223
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,889
if you wanted to communicate
with someone far away,

224
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,470
you would make a long distance phone call.

225
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,090
But times have changed.

226
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,128
Now you would probably
send them a text message

227
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,806
or just send them an email.

228
00:08:30,806 --> 00:08:33,640
The English phrase times
have changed is used

229
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,659
to describe big changes

230
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,529
that we have all experienced as humans

231
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,539
over the course of time.

232
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,139
Probably the smartphone
is the biggest change

233
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,630
that I can think of
when I use this phrase.

234
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,800
Many years ago, no one had a
smartphone in their pocket,

235
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,160
but times have changed.

236
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,000
Now, almost everyone has
a smartphone with them

237
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,530
on a daily basis and uses it
for all kinds of things.

238
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,610
Wow, times have changed.

239
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,860
Well, hey, thank you so much
