00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,163
Our company has a new strategic initiative to increase market penetration, maximise brand loyalty, and enhance intangible assets.

2
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:11,714
In pursuit of these objectives, we've started a new project --

3
00:00:11,715 --> 00:00:14,103
for which we require 7 red lines.

4
00:00:14,103 --> 00:00:16,533
I understand your company can help us in this matter.

5
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:17,534
Of course!

6
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:22,610
Walter here will be the Project Manager. Walter, we can do this, can't we?

7
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:23,611
Yes, of course.

8
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:26,942
Anderson here is our expert in all matters related to drawing red lines. 

9
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,757
We brought him along today to share his professional opinion.

10
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:32,070
Nice to meet you! Well, you all know me.

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,091
This is Justine, our company's design specialist.

12
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,043
Hallo.

13
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:39,138
We need you to draw seven red lines.

14
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:44,675
All of them strictly perpendicular; some with green ink and some with transparent. Can you do that?

15
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:47,719
No. I'm afraid we --

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,663
Let's not rush into any hasty answers, Anderson! The task has been set and needs to be carried out.

17
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:53,158
At the end of the day, you are an expert.

18
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:58,384
The term "red line" implies the colour of the line to be red. To draw a red line with green ink is --

19
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:02,435
well if it is not exactly impossible, then it is pretty close to being impossible.

20
00:01:02,436 --> 00:01:04,187
What does it even mean: "impossible"?

21
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:08,450
I mean, it is quite possible that there are some people, say suffering from colour blindness,

22
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:10,956
for whom the colour of the lines doesn't really make a difference.

23
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:15,756
But I am quite sure that the target audience of your project does not consists solely of such people.

24
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:17,730
So in principle this is possible.

25
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,090
I'll simplify.

26
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,015
A line as such can be drawn with absolutely any ink.

27
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:27,541
But if you want to get a red line, you need to use red ink.

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,037
What if we draw them with blue ink?

29
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:34,623
It still won't work. If you use blue ink, you will get blue lines.

30
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:40,076
And what exactly did you mean, when you talked about the transparent ink?

31
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:42,770
How to better explain?

32
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:44,576
I'm sure you know what "transparent" means?

33
00:01:44,577 --> 00:01:45,984
Yes, I do.

34
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:49,492
And what a "red line" means, I hope I don't need to explain to you?

35
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:50,457
Of course not.

36
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:55,457
Well. You need to draw red lines with transparent ink.

37
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:58,858
Could you describe what you imagine the end result would look like?

38
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:01,036
C'mon, Anderson! What do we have here, kindergarten?

39
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:05,365
Let's not waste our time with these unproductive quarrels.

40
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,762
The task has been set; the task is plain and clear.

41
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:11,474
Now, if you have any specific questions, go ahead!

42
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,168
You're the expert here!

43
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:16,814
Alright, let's leave aside the colour for the moment.

44
00:02:16,815 --> 00:02:20,376
You had something there also relating to perpendicularity?..

45
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:22,614
Seven lines, all strictly perpendicular.

46
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,399
To what?

47
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:30,586
Erm, to everything. Among themselves.

48
00:02:30,587 --> 00:02:32,806
I assumed you know what perpendicular lines are like!

49
00:02:32,807 --> 00:02:34,293
Of course he does. He's an expert!

50
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,801
Two lines can be perpendicular.

51
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:40,219
All seven can't be simultaneously perpendicular to each other.

52
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,950
I'll show you.

53
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:48,412
This is a line, right?

54
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:49,413
Yes.

55
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:54,408
And another one. Is it perpendicular to the first line?

56
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:57,321
Well.

57
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,251
Yes, it is perpendicular.

58
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:00,252
Exactly!

59
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:05,062
Wait, wait, I'm not done. And a third one: is it perpendicular to the first line?

60
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:11,353
Yes, it is! But it doesn't cross the second line. They're both parallel.

61
00:03:12,532 --> 00:03:13,647
Not perpendicular!

62
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,605
I suppose so.

63
00:03:17,606 --> 00:03:21,137
There it is. Two lines can be perpendicular --

64
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:22,397
Can I have the pen?

65
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,629
How about this?

66
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:49,563
This is a triangle.

67
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:53,306
It's definitely not perpendicular lines.

68
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:56,013
And there are three, not seven.

69
00:03:57,853 --> 00:03:58,735
Why are they blue?

70
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:00,454
Indeed. Wanted to ask that myself.

71
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:04,026
I have a blue pen with me. This was just a demonstration --

72
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:07,459
That's the problem, your lines are blue. Draw them with red ink!

73
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,012
It won't solve the problem.

74
00:04:09,013 --> 00:04:10,946
How do you know before you've tried? 

75
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,965
Lets draw them with red ink and then let's see.

76
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:13,966
I don't have a red pen with me, --

77
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:19,099
but I am completely certain that with red ink the result will still be the same.

78
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,345
Didn't you tell us earlier that you can only draw red lines with red ink?

79
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,334
In fact, yes, I've written it down here!

80
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:28,914
And now you want to draw them with a blue ink. Do you want to call these red lines?

81
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,050
I think I understand. You're not talking about the colour now, right?

82
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:37,472
You're talking about that, what do you call it: per-per, dick-dick --

83
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:38,966
Perpendicularity, yes!

84
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:41,459
That's it, now you've confused everyone. 

85
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:44,742
So what exactly is stopping us from doing this?

86
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:46,242
Geometry.

87
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,398
Just ignore it!

88
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:52,856
We have a task. Seven red lines. It's not twenty; it's just seven.

89
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:58,024
Anderson, I understand; you're a specialist of a narrow field, you don't see the overall picture.

90
00:04:58,025 --> 00:05:01,661
But surely it's not a difficult task to draw some seven lines!

91
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:03,578
Exactly. Suggest a solution!

92
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:09,596
Any fool can criticise, no offence, but you're an expert, you should know better!

93
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:15,124
OK. Let me draw you two perfectly perpendicular red lines, --

94
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,583
and I will draw the rest with transparent ink.

95
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,834
They'll be invisible, but I'll draw them.

96
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:23,095
Would this suit us?

97
00:05:24,186 --> 00:05:25,623
Yes, this will suit us.

98
00:05:26,383 --> 00:05:28,670
Yes, but at least a couple with green ink.

99
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:31,048
Oh, and I have another question, if I may.

100
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:34,078
Can you draw one of the lines in the form of a kitten?

101
00:05:34,631 --> 00:05:35,320
A what?

102
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,617
In the form of a kitten. 

103
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:40,710
Market research tells our users like cute animals. It'd be really great if --

104
00:05:40,711 --> 00:05:41,711
No-oh.

105
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:42,996
Why?

106
00:05:42,997 --> 00:05:45,059
Look, I can of course draw you a cat.

107
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,015
I'm no artist, but I can give it a try.

108
00:05:47,016 --> 00:05:49,095
But it won't be a line any more. It will be a cat. 

109
00:05:49,096 --> 00:05:51,451
A line and a cat: those are two different things.

110
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,997
A kitten. Not a cat, but a kitten.

111
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:58,674
It's little, cute, cuddly. Cats, on the other hand --

112
00:05:58,675 --> 00:05:59,689
It doesn't make a difference.

113
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,354
Anderson, at least hear her out! 

114
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:04,117
She hasn't even finished speaking, and you're already saying "No!"

115
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:09,681
I got the idea, but it is impossible to draw a line in the form of a cat ten.

116
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:12,053
What about a bird?

117
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:17,306
So, where did we stop? What are we doing?

118
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:21,875
Seven red lines, two with red ink, two with green ink and the rest - with transparent.

119
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,280
Did I understand correctly? --
-- Yes.

120
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:26,100
Excellent! In which case that's everything, right?

121
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,951
Oh, oh, I almost forgot, we also have a red balloon.

122
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:30,911
Do you know if you could inflate it?

123
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:37,020
What do I have to do with balloons?

124
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,021
It's red.

125
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,654
Anderson, can you or can you not do this? A simple question.

126
00:06:42,119 --> 00:06:43,502
As such, I can of course, but --

127
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,923
Excellent. Organise a business trip, we'll cover the expenses, --

128
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:52,121
go over to their location, inflate the balloon.

129
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:55,411
Well this was very productive, thank you all!

130
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,210
Can I ask one more question, please?

131
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:14,543
When you inflate the balloon, could you do it in the form of a kitten?

132
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:17,407
Of course I can!

133
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:21,739
I can do anything, I can do absolutely anything.

134
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:25,396
I'm an expert!
