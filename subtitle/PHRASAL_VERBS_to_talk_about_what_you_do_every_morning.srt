Hi, I'm Ronnie. I have a YouTube channel. 
You're watching it, but you need to  

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:13,200
subscribe to it. EnglishLessons4U. 
Hit that subscribe button, do it,  

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,320
do it now or I'm not going to teach you... okay, 
I'll teach you anyways. But subscribe and sign up.  

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,660
It'll be great, you'll love it. No, you will.
I'm going to teach you phrasal verbs, and phrasal  

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:36,360
verbs are essential. A lot of people kind of get 
off track and they start to study idioms. Wow,  

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:42,840
idioms are kind of old, in my opinion, and not 
very useful. But, one thing that is essential  

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,140
for you to understand and learn in English are 
these crazy phrasal verbs. What is a phrasal verb,  

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:58,410
you ask? You did, I heard you! A phrasal verb 
has a verb + a preposition. So, prepositions  

9
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:07,350
are things like "up, on, down, around". So, 
if you have a verb and a preposition together,  

10
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,430
magically these are called phrasal verbs. And 
they're very confusing. A lot of people have  

11
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:21,060
problems with them, because one phrasal verb can 
have many meanings, but I'm here to make it easy  

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,680
for you and teach you about something you probably 
do every day. It's called your morning routine.
 

13
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,970
I don't know about you, but I have to wake up 
in the morning. Some of you have to wake up in  

14
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,320
the afternoon or at night, depending on your 
work schedule or if you work. So, the first  

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:53,250
thing that happens. Most treacherously and most 
terribly is, "My alarm goes off". In the past,  

16
00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:01,590
I could also say, "My alarm went off", maybe 
at 7:00. If you wanted to be very specific,  

17
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,310
you could say 7:00am. But because most people 
wake up in the morning, you don't need to say  

18
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,340
"am". Most people understand you're waking up 
in the morning. If you work a night shift or,  

19
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,510
I don't know, you're a vampire, you could also 
say, "Oh, my alarm went off at 7:00pm". That's  

20
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,480
cool, but usually we don't need to specify or 
we don't need to say "am", because most people  

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:38,220
understand it's the morning time. And this is also 
very illogical, crazy in English. An alarm goes  

22
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:49,230
off. But in reality, it goes on. Because it makes 
a noise. So, in English, we just like to have a  

23
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,210
giggle and make it difficult. So, we have to say, 
"My alarm goes off". It means my alarm sounds or  

24
00:02:54,210 --> 00:03:04,170
makes a noise. And then, I turn off the alarm that 
went off. Don't get it? Don't worry about that.
 

25
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:15,600
So, my alarm goes off at 7:00. What do I do next? 
I wake up. That means I open my eyes and I - Oh  

26
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:24,180
God, why isn't is Saturday? Why do I have to wake 
up? Why was I born? Then, to actually physically  

27
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:32,160
leave your bed, you're going to say "get up". So, 
maybe you are good at getting out of bed, but I'm  

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,260
not. So, my alarm goes off at 7:00, but I actually 
get up, which means I leave my beautiful, warm,  

29
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:49,620
luscious bed, at 7:30. What are you doing for half 
an hour, Ronnie? Yes, I am trying to make time  

30
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,140
stop so I can sleep longer, but it never works. 
And then I try to figure out all the problems of  

31
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,800
the world and solve some English problems, but 
yeah. 7:30 comes again and I have to get up.
 

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:13,770
I take off my PJs. Peanut butter jam? No, PJs are 
the short form of pajamas or pyjamas. Pajamas are  

33
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:19,829
the clothes you wear at night in your bed. You 
can wear them in the daytime too, doesn't matter.  

34
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:26,700
They're usually funky, though. This phrasal verb 
we can replace with just the verb "remove". So,  

35
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:33,120
you can say, "I remove my pajamas" or my 
PJs, but that sounds very strange. We don't  

36
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,730
say that. If you said it, I would understand, 
but that's not how we speak naturally. We say,  

37
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:46,440
"I take off my pajamas" or my PJs.
I actually shower, okay? I - it just  

38
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,610
wasn't a phrasal verb, so I couldn't put it in 
here. But after I take my shower, I need to put  

39
00:04:53,610 --> 00:05:00,270
on my clothes. Now, in English, we don't use the 
verb "wear" when we're actually getting dressed.  

40
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,430
Which means, putting on your clothes. In some 
languages, you guys say, "I wear my clothes",  

41
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:12,030
but we don't use the verb "wear". We say, 
"I put on my clothes". So, in the morning,  

42
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:19,170
we put on our clothes. I take off my PJ's, I 
have a shower, and then I put on my clothes.  

43
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:29,460
Because it's illegal to walk around naked.
The next thing I do is I put in, or I can also say  

44
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:39,150
I put on my contacts. Now, contacts is actually 
the short form of contact lenses. We don't need  

45
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:45,750
to bother to say lenses. Everybody knows if you 
put in or put on your contacts, those are contact  

46
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:53,850
lenses. Maybe you also like to wear makeup, so 
you can say, "I put on my makeup". You could say  

47
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:01,440
apply my makeup, but again, it's not natural. 
We always use a phrasal verb "put on". Maybe  

48
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,630
you want to wear glasses. Don't, please don't put 
on contacts and glasses at the same time. You'll  

49
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:14,070
hurt your vision. But you would definitely put 
on glasses and you would put on jewellery. This  

50
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:21,660
is a difficult word for people. Repeat after me: 
jewellery. I put in jewellery. As I said before,  

51
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:30,960
rings, earrings, a necklace. All of these things 
are jewellery, and we put them on, because they're  

52
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:39,580
outside of our body. So, I put on these things.
Then, just to help with life, I do the most  

53
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:44,860
essential thing. I turn on the coffee 
maker. I could say "start the coffee maker",  

54
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,680
but because it's a button, I would say 
I turn on the coffee maker. "Start"  

55
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,530
is too formal. You can start your car, but 
you're going to turn on the coffee maker.
 

56
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:03,880
Now, one thing that you should do, not every day, 
because you can't, but I highly suggest that you  

57
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:14,830
sign up for notifications by ringing the bell 
- ding ding ding - on EnglishLessons4U. This is  

58
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,050
what you're watching. This is the amazingness of 
what you're doing right now. So, if you sign up  

59
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,210
for notifications and you ring the bell, this 
means that when I make a new video for you,  

60
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:31,510
you get a notification and you can watch it 
right away. Because some people say, "Ronnie,  

61
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:40,060
you had a new video and I didn't know!" Did you 
ring my bell? You gotta ring my bell to get the  

62
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,680
notifications. So, actually, do it now. Do it 
now, hit the bell, ring the bell, ding ding.  

63
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,110
And I'll see you later. Please don't forget to 
shower, though. Essential, essential.
