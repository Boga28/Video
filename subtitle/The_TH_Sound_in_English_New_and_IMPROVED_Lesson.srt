1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,120
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:01,560
It's Hadar.

3
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,960
Thank you so much for joining me.

4
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,360
Today, I'm going to share with
you one of my most complete and

5
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,040
thorough lessons about the TH.

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,280
And yes, I know it's funny that I used the
word 'thorough' to describe a TH lesson.

7
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,240
Anyway, I love teaching the TH sound.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,320
First, because it's easy to understand
with the right explanation and practice.

9
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,040
And it's easy to implement.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,040
And then it gets my students
usually great results.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,880
Second, because I know that this is
a sound that a lot of people struggle

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,560
with and feel self-conscious about.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,200
And even though it's not crucial for
your clarity for the most part, being

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,960
self-conscious about a certain sound is
not something that helps you sound clear

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,040
and fluent, because you're obsessing
over things that are not helping you

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,760
feel free, and clear, and confident.

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,000
So this is why I usually teach the
TH right at the start of my programs.

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,480
In fact, this lesson is taken
from my program New Sound.

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,480
New Sound is designed to help you
reach a breakthrough in your English.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,480
And it really covers all the elements
that are required for you to transform

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,720
how you think, feel, and use English.

22
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,360
Most of it is based on
pronunciation training.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,960
Because I believe that it's so
important to understand the external

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
part of English, so you can free
yourself up and feel clear and

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,920
expressive so it's not in your way.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,920
We go really deep into learning all
the key sounds of American English.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,240
And also, we go really deep into
understanding prosody, which is

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,720
intonation, rhythm, stress, phrasing,
breathing, tone of voice, voice.

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,120
So, all of these elements that make
you a good communicator are important

30
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,040
to learn and to understand, and most
importantly, to practice effectively.

31
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,640
So, as you will see, we will share
with you a lesson about the TH.

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,960
It's a part of the entire lesson,
because we actually start with a

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,280
self-assessment process, so you'll
know what you need to focus on.

34
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Because not everyone has the same needs.

35
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,760
And then we go into deeper
practice and tackling challenges.

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,840
Today I'm going to share with you
the explanation of the TH and a short

37
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,080
practice, which, I have no doubt,
is going to help you significantly.

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,920
And you'll know how to keep
on practicing it on your own.

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,160
If you need more help and you want
to find out more about New Sound,

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,840
I'm going to put a link in the
description so you can check it out.

41
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,640
When we release this video,
doors are open for New Sound.

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,680
So you can go check out the program,
and maybe you would consider joining us.

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,280
And if you're watching this when doors are
closed, then you can get on the list to

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,960
be the first to know when we open doors.

45
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,440
All right, that's it.

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,160
I'm not going to make you wait any longer.

47
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,280
So let's watch and practice the TH lesson.

48
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,760
And I will see you on the other side.

49
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,280
Welcome to the TH sound.

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,600
The TH sound is a sound that is created with

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,200
the tip of the tongue, as in ‘think’ and ‘they’.

52
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,200
A lot of students
 are very aware of the sound,

53
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,680
but at the same time,
 they feel uncomfortable when using it or

54
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,920
they feel that it's a little too much or fake, 
or just strange. 

55
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
Because if you don't have 

56
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,240
the TH sound in your native language, 

57
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,160
then it's going to be strange
 to speak with the tongue out.

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,080
However, if you practice it 

59
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,880
consistently and the way
 I'm going to show you in this program,

60
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,120
then I guarantee that very soon
 you'll be able to make it your own

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,360
and feel comfortable, and the sound
 is going to be effortless for you.

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,080
Because the good thing about the TH 

63
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
is that it's very clear
 how to pronounce it and how to use it.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,200
So, it's really all about the muscles
 and all about developing those 

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,920
new healthy speaking habits. 

66
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,440
Now, when we talk about the pronunciation
 of the sounds, we want

67
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,560
to take into consideration three elements.

68
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,400
The first one is the manner of the sound,

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,240
then the placement, and then the voicing.

70
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,480
So, let's begin with the placement. 

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,440
When pronouncing the TH sound, the tip of the tongue comes out

72
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,200
and touches the top teeth.

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,200
This is where the
 air or voice are blocked.

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,840
And that's the place of articulation.

75
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,840
So it's the tip of the
 tongue and the teeth.

76
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,240
In a second we're going to talk 

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,240
about common challenges
 when pronouncing the TH sound.

78
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
But the most important thing 

79
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,320
that you need to remember
 is that the tongue has to be out.

80
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,800
And there has to be contact
 between the tongue

81
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
and teeth to pronounce the TH sound.

82
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,560
Think

83
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,720
They

84
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,800
When it comes to manner, the TH is a fricative.

85
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,160
That means that the sound is not blocked.

86
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,000
The air is not blocked. 

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,840
But it's released gradually. So it's restricted, right?

88
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,960
Think about it. We release air, but the air is restricted

89
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,240
because of the contact of the tongue and teeth.

90
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,480
So you let it out slowly,

91
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,040
almost like blowing out a candle. 

92
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,880
It is not a stop sound, it's not stopped.

93
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,000
That would be a T or a D.
But it's released gradually.

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,960
This is why it's a little longer
 than a stop sound,

95
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,800
for example, a D. 

96
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,040
Listen: ‘they’ - ’day’

97
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:42,080
‘they’ - I can stretch it forever.

98
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,680
D, D, ‘day’. It's a lot shorter.

99
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,840
OK? So that's the idea of a fricative.

100
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,320
And when it comes to voicing, 
we have two different TH’s.

101
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,480
One is the voiceless TH,
 or as some people call it, the soft TH,

102
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,480
where it's just air coming out
 between the tongue and teeth.

103
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,760
Think

104
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,840
Versus a voiced TH, as in ‘they’.

105
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,640
Where it’s both air and sound.

106
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,040
The vocal cords are vibrating.

107
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,280
And if you put your hands
 here on your throat, try it.

108
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,400
Now let's release air. Just air. 

109
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,600
And now add the vocal cords. Just sound.

110
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
Did you feel the vibrations? Good.

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,960
So that is your voice,
 and it actually changes the sound.

112
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,560
So we're not doing anything different here.

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,760
But it created a different sound.

114
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,360
think - they

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,040
Both are spelled with two letters - T and H - TH.

116
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,400
But they have two different phonetic symbols.

117
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,240
This is the phonetic symbol
 of the voiceless TH.

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,760
This is the phonetic symbol - the IPA of the voiced TH. 

119
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,240
Now, before we practice it in words,
 let's talk about

120
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,080
common challenges that you might face
 when pronouncing this sound.

121
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
So we've already agreed that it's going to be 

122
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,960
a little challenging for some people 
to stick the tongue out,

123
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,600
if that sound does not exist
 in their native language.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,240
So, you might be wanting to pull the tongue
 back as you're pronouncing the TH.

125
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,880
And you may think that the tongue is out,

126
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,160
but ultimately, if it's inside, then
 this is a sound that you're going to get.

127
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,520
Did that sound like a TH? 

128
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,440
Because I blocked the air, 

129
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,640
it actually sounded more like a
 T sound than a TH.

130
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,120
 thought

131
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,960
Now that my tongue is out,
 the sound is different. Listen again.

132
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,960
By the way, I may even stick the tongue out
 and still get the same quality.

133
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,520
That's because I pressed my tongue
 against the teeth really strongly,

134
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,600
and I did not allow the air to pass. 

135
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,560
So, you need to remember two things. 

136
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,360
If you don't hear that friction sound of the TH

137
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,040
that resembles an S or an F,

138
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,080
then your tongue is either inside - 
 right behind the teeth - or outside,

139
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,520
but it's pressed so strongly against
 the teeth that the air is not coming out.

140
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,280
So make sure that the tongue
 is loose and relaxed.

141
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,880
And one more thing. 

142
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,840
Think of the body of the tongue,
 and you want to make sure that it's down

143
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,880
because sometimes
 people stick the tongue out 

144
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,440
and the body of the tongue is so high up,
 that it's blocking the air inside.

145
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,280
And you have no idea why you're
 pronouncing a T or a D instead of a TH.

146
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,120
’dey’ instead of ‘they’

147
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,400
So it has to do with
 what's happening inside the mouth as well.

148
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,320
Good. Now, another common challenge is that when people are not aware of sticking the tongue out

149
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,520
and you may want to create that friction sound.

150
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,520
But you'll keep the tongue inside.

151
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,360
’sink’

152
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,760
And then you're pronouncing
 an S sound instead of a TH sound.

153
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,040
‘sink’ instead of ‘think’. 

154
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,640
So in that case, you want to make sure
that the tip of the tongue comes out.

155
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,880
And you can do that by putting your finger right here.

156
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,560
And you might want to feel the tongue
 touching the finger.

157
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,000
Or you might want to use a mirror
 or your phone camera to see the tongue

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,840
actually coming out. 

159
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
think

160
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,840
Now, if you're hearing the quality of the TH 
and you're not seeing the tip of the tongue,

161
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,200
maybe you're using your bottom
 lip to pronounce the TH: 

162
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,640
as in ’vey’ instead of ’they’, 
or ‘fink’ instead of ‘think’.

163
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,560
And in that case, you might want to hold 

164
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,840
your bottom lip with your finger for a little bit,

165
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,440
making sure that it's not coming up, and
 that the tongue is actually coming out.

166
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Instead, ‘they’, ‘think’. Right?

167
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,320
It's all a matter of controlling
 your tongue and articulation organs,

168
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,120
becoming more aware of what
 your mouth is actually doing.

169
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,880
And when you're in control,
 then you're less likely

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,840
to go back into old habits,
 which is the pronunciation habits

171
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,240
that you've developed, like pronouncing
 an F or an S instead of a TH.

172
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:33,720
So as you can see, the TH can be 
substituted with several sounds, like a T or a D.

173
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,640
S or a Z - ‘zey’ instead of ‘they; or F or V.

174
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,000
It depends on your native language
 and your speaking habits.

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,400
But when you become aware of that
 and you understand what you tend to do,

176
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,680
it's a lot easier to change that
 and go into the right pronunciation.

177
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,400
Now, I want to remind you that it is
 possible for you to pronounce the TH.

178
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,920
Your tongue is not too short. 

179
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
Your teeth are not too wide. 

180
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,560
It has nothing to do
 with the structure of your mouth.

181
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,040
You're able to pronounce the TH. 

182
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,120
If you find it challenging, it's
 only because you're going back to old

183
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,080
pronunciation habits, and
 to what's comfortable, and what's familiar,

184
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,600
because that's how you pronounce sounds
 in your native language.

185
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,280
OK? So it's just a matter
 of gaining control

186
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,560
over your tongue, over your articulation
 organs, becoming aware and being patient.

187
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,040
 And doing it again and again and again

188
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,760
and doing it slowly, until you hear 
what you're looking for.

189
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,240
So now that you know
 how to pronounce the TH,

190
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,840
let's move on to practicing it in words,
 phrases, minimal pairs, and sentences.

191
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,200
OK, so let's begin with words.

192
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,480
We're going to start with
 words with voiceless TH.

193
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,640
Stick the tongue out,
 make sure the air passes.

194
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,600
And prolong the sound, do it with me.

195
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Thanks. Thank you. Thanks.

196
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,880
Theory. What a great theory.

197
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,440
Theory. It's only in theory.

198
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,600
Stick the tongue out. 

199
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,320
Feel the air passing. 

200
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,720
If you hear ‘teory’,
 then you want to relax the tongue.

201
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,360
Stick it out a bit more: theory.

202
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,760
Now, that might be confusing
 with a Z sound in the middle.

203
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,640
And yes, it's a Z sound, even though
 it's spelled with an S.

204
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,320
So, if you feel that
 you're saying something like

205
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,320
‘southend’, like switching the sounds,
 so concentrate on the TH first.

206
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,200
Hold it out, ’thaw’ - long ‘aw’ sound, ’thaw’
 and then bring the tongue

207
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
in for the Z sound: 

208
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,400
‘z’nd’ - ’thaw-zn’d’.

209
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,160
thousand.

210
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,720
Let's review the words.

211
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,200
Very good. Now, moving on to voiced TH.

212
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,160
Feel the vibrations.

213
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,800
Now, you may see that it's spelled the same,
 and you might be asking yourself,

214
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,000
how would I know
 if it's a voiceless or a voiced TH?

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,360
So wait with that thought. 

216
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,800
I'll answer it in a little bit.

217
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
the car

218
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,680
the people

219
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,240
The tongue comes out.

220
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,600
You hear the vibrations. 

221
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Now, with this word in particular, sometimes

222
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,480
you can cheat and put the tongue
 on the back of the teeth.

223
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,960
When you hold it out,

224
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,800
you may even feel tickles here. 

225
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,920
If you don't, maybe
 the air is blocked somewhere,

226
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,520
so you want to see why.

227
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,400
the car, the people, the chair.

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,440
‘this’ - a voiced TH, 
 an ‘i’ sound, and an S. ‘this’.

229
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,880
‘this’, right? We don't want 

230
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,040
to hear ‘dis’ or ‘zis’.

231
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,240
this

232
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,160
Now, having said that, again,
 if you pronounce it more like 

233
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,280
a D sound, because it's a function
 word, it's no big deal.

234
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
But for the sake of practice. 

235
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,000
Right? It's not about mastering it

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,880
every time you speak English.

237
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,400
No, it's just for the sake of practice 

238
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,000
to train your tongue to get to the right
 placement, in all the words.

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,360
After that, we'll learn where we can do
 all these shortcuts, because this is not

240
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,000
as important as ‘father’, or at least
 the TH in these words.

241
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,920
Can you hear the difference
 between the two?

242
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,000
These. We begin with a voiced TH.

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,880
But here we have high ‘ee’ sound. 

244
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,360
‘These’ - ending with a Z sound. 

245
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,240
this - these.

246
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,880
Now let's continue with phrases. 

247
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,400
Now, this is where it gets interesting, 

248
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,760
because this is an opportunity
 to see how we transition from the TH

249
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,800
to other sounds and vice versa.

250
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,840
Let me think about it. 

251
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,360
So the ‘let me’ - we can reduce it to ‘lemme’.

252
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,880
Lemme think about it.

253
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,960
Let's do this thing.

254
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,240
Say it again. Let's do this thing.

255
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,920
What's the challenging part? 

256
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,160
Where do you get stuck? 

257
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,720
Probably the transition
 between the S and the TH, right?

258
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,480
Let's do this thing.

259
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,560
So make sure you bring the tongue in
 for the S and then you push it out

260
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,480
for the TH - ‘this-thing’. Right?

261
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,640
And you want to make sure
 that the tongue doesn't 

262
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,240
stop in the middle
 and stops the air as well.

263
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,000
This thing. Make sure it's very smooth.

264
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,120
Let's move into sentences. 

265
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,320
They need to think about the earth more

266
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,800
Notice that here the ’the’
is pronounced as ’thee’ - ‘thee earth’.

267
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,000
That's because there is a vowel right after. 
When there is a vowel,

268
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,760
we want to say the word ’the’
 with an ‘ee’ sound,

269
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,120
so it's easier to connect: ‘thee-earth’.

270
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,440
When it's a consonant, then we reduce it: 
the car, the plane. 

271
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,800
They need to think about the earth more.

272
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,319
Now let's practice
 minimal pairs: similar words

273
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,759
that the only thing that is different
 is that one sound - a TH and another sound.

274
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,640
For example, day - they.

275
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,399
So a lot of people might substitute
 the voiced TH with a D sound.

276
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,160
So we want to look into those pairs
 to, again, develop awareness

277
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,160
and to remind the brain
 that these are two different sounds: day - they.

278
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,560
Let's do it again. 
‘day’ - ‘they’

279
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,160
And when you practice minimal pairs,
 make sure to always say the words first

280
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,680
and then the sentence. 

281
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,440
They had a great day today. 

282
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,480
They had a great day today.

283
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,400
sink - think

284
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,760
I think the ship is about to sink.

285
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
OK. That's it for now. 

286
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,800
Massage your jaw a little bit. Do a lip trill.

287
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,160
Take a deep breath in, breathe out.

288
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,600
You did a fantastic job.

289
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,000
All right, that's it.

290
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,280
I hope you enjoyed it.

291
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,360
And I hope it was helpful, helped you
understand how to simplify the TH sound.

292
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,040
If you want to find out more about
New Sound and all the lessons that we

293
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,560
teach there, and how you can transform
your English using my Pronunciation

294
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,040
Confidence Method, and all the lessons
about pronunciation, I invite you to

295
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,360
click the link in the description.

296
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,920
If doors are closed, get on the list to
be the first to know when we open doors.

297
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,120
Just so you know, the program
is not just the videos.

298
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,840
We also offer a lot of coaching.

299
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,440
So you get to work with
me, and with our coaches.

300
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,240
And you can even get feedback
on your pronunciation videos.

301
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,120
So there's a lot that goes into
it: a lot of speaking practice,

302
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
and practice groups, and Sprints.

303
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
So, it's a lot of fun.

304
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,320
You should check it out.

305
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,560
Anyway, I hope you'll have some
time to put it into practice.

306
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,400
Remember, practice makes better.

307
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,960
So take what you've learned, and maybe
make a list of all the TH words that

308
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,120
you often use, and just practice it
everyday for 3 minutes, that's it.

309
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,640
I guarantee that you are
going to feel the difference.

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,560
All right.

311
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,240
Take care.

312
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,440
Thank you so much for watching.

313
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,960
And I'll see you next
week in the next video.
