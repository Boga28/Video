00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:06,510
People in the North Kivu province in the Democratic
Republic of Congo have been returning to their

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:12,240
homes after Saturday's eruption of Mount Nyiragongo.
At least 15 people are reported to have died,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,930
most of them scrambling to flee their homes,
following official warnings that many believe

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,439
came too late. Provincial authorities say
the death toll is likely to rise, as the situation

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,660
on the ground is still too chaotic for a thorough
assessment.

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:35,260
Aerial pictures show a trail of destruction
- a community overrun by lava from Saturday's

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,250
fatal volcanic eruption.
Hundreds of homes were destroyed in eastern

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,330
Congo.
People told of how they'd been forced to leave

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:54,390
behind their loved ones as the lava approached.
"I was with my husband, who's old and couldn't

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,580
leave the house because he was sick and couldn't
walk. I said to myself, I can't go alone.

11
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,619
I went back to at least try to get him out
but couldn't. I ran away and he got burned

12
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,660
inside."
"I was sweating, trying to lift an old man

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:21,760
who died in the end. I lost my strength when
I saw that the lava was coming."

14
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,230
Many more people are missing since the eruption.
The survivors left filled with uncertainty

15
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:32,720
about the fate of their loved ones and their
own futures.

16
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,960
There's been criticism of the authorities
for failing to alert residents.

17
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,250
"It's incomprehensible how with a respectable
and funded institution like the Goma Volcano

18
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,659
Observatory can fail to warn of an imminent
eruption, not even an hour before. It's incomprehensible."

19
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,240
And while the city of Goma may have been spared
- there's no question these villagers to the

20
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,130
east have paid a heavy price.
