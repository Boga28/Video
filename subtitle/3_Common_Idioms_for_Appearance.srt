00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
Hey everyone, this is Alex from
EngVid. And today I want to share with

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:12,000
you three common idioms that you can use
to talk about appearance. Now, these

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,030
idioms can all be found in my book, this
book right here. It's called "200

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:23,790
Practical English Idioms". And what I
did with this book was try to think of

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:30,240
200 of the most common idioms that
English speakers use to help you, give

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,880
you language you will actually use. So
what's great about this book is I give

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,730
you a lot of examples. And I only
include high frequency idioms. So you

8
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:48,030
won't hear idioms that are no longer in
use in this book. If you want to check

9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,350
it out, check out the link attached to
this video. And while you're on my

12
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,420

13
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,710
EngVid, on my own website, and you won't
miss any details.

14
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,870
Now, let's talk about the idioms that I
want to talk about from this book today.

15
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:26,010
So appearance: "You look like a million
bucks." So if someone looks like a

16
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:32,130
million bucks, this means they look
great, as well as they can look. So if

17
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,190
someone got a new haircut, for example,
you can say, "Wow, you look like a

18
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:44,340
million bucks". And remember, "bucks" is
slang for dollars. So if someone looks

19
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,380
like a million bucks, they look
fantastic. They look great. So a new

20
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,550
haircut or maybe they're wearing really
nice clothes, and they just look

21
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:59,850
fantastic. This idiom can also be used
to talk about the performance of someone

22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,250
in a sport, for example. So you can say,
"oh, man, did you watch the game last

23
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,169
night, Ronaldo looked like a million
bucks", or "Messi looked like a million

24
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:15,540
bucks". "LeBron James looked like a
million bucks". So if someone plays

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,550
really well, to a high standard, you can
say they look like a million bucks as

26
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,910
well.

27
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,930
Another idiom that I want to share with
you guys today is "to catch someone's

28
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:34,490
eye". So if you catch someone's eye, it
means that you attract their attention

29
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,980
because of a particular characteristic
about yourself. Now I know this idiom

30
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,110
exists in many languages, like in
Polish, for example, you can say,

31
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:54,500
[Polish], like she caught my eye. So if
someone catches your eye, they attract

32
00:02:54,530 --> 00:03:00,500
your attention. So to give you some
examples, his smile really caught my

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,770
eye, I was looking at new cars, and the
price of this one really caught my eye.

34
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,870
So a price can catch your eye if it's a
good price for something, for example.

35
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:18,110
So whether it's a particular feature of
a person, a particular feature of a

36
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:24,680
thing, anything that attracts your
attention, you can say, wow, that really

37
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:32,150
caught my eye. So "caught" is the past
of "catch", right? And also important to

38
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,670
remember, you can use idioms and the
past, the present, or the future -- just

39
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:44,090
make sure that you are using the correct
word order. Okay, so caught my eye,

40
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,650
okay, not caught eye my or something
like this.  make sure you try to use

41
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,790
the correct word order.

42
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:57,550
And the third idiom I want to share with
you today is "to cry your eyes out". So

43
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:03,970
if you cry your eyes out, this means
that you cry strongly, forcefully with a

44
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:10,150
lot of power, like you weep, basically.
So for example, if you watch a movie

45
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,640
that is incredibly sad, and if you are
someone who cries during movies that are

46
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:21,940
emotional, you can say, "Oh, I cried my
eyes out". So it's like imagine that

47
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:28,120
your eyes are just full of tears, and
everything is coming out of your eyes.

48
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:34,840
So I cried my eyes out. This is another
way to talk about how someone looks when

49
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,160
they're crying, for example.

50
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,710
So once again, you can look like a
million bucks, which means you look

51
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:49,780
great or you performed really well. What
was the second one? To catch your eye.

52
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:54,700
Right? So I hope this book is catching
your eye in this video. It looks pretty

53
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,560
good, right? I'm very proud of this. My
sister designed this actually. So I love

54
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,220
her today. Because she did a great job
with us -- today, you know -- and to cry

55
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,020
your eyes out, right? This means to cry
forcefully to cry strongly. So I will

56
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,810
cry my eyes out if you don't buy this
book, guys. I'm very hungry. Alex needs

57
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,480
food, Alex needs needs you to buy this
book. Is it.  am I coming across too

58
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,640
desperate? I hope not. But no,
seriously. I really strongly recommend

59
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,040
