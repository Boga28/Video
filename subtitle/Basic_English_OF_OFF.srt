1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,150
"One of these days" — one of these, one
off these days, one of these day. Yeah,

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,320
that is kind of tricky, isn't it? Hi,
James from engVid. Got a problem. I've

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,530
had students asking about the
pronunciation difference between "of"

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,200
and "off". And what the words actually
means; it's not as simple. It's a

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,780
homophone, kinda; homonym, definitely.
We're going to go to the board and

6
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,960
figure out the differences. Why? Well,
pronunciation isn't just it sounds

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,200
different; they actually have different
meanings, and will affect the sentence,

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,610
or what you're trying to convey or tell
someone else. So, why is it important?

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,050
For clarity when we're speaking or when
we're reading, and it will help you, you

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,890
know, without expanding your vocabulary,
make you.  Well, it's like having a

11
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,490
pocket knife; it will make you much more
functional. And that's a good thing,

12
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:57,330
right? Okay, so how I'm going to do this
for you is we'll go through

13
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,790
pronunciation of just a quick one, then
I'll talk about the reduction — we call

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,630
it reduction of "of", the preposition
"of" — and I'll talk about how one. 

15
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,540
Well, let's go to the board and do it,
shall we? We'll go through it.

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:13,230
So, I'm going to start off by saying:
"of" or "off". Let's start with the

17
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,090
beginning "of" — it has, like, a "v"
sound. So, there is a different.  a

18
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,180
definitive difference in the sound. This
is a "v" sound; it sounds like that:

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:29,280
"vvv". The bottom lip goes to the teeth:
"vvv", because it vibrates. You hear

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,360
that? Vibrate. "Vvv". Okay? And with
"off", I like to say this: "Off" has one

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,160
extra "f" to remind you to say: "fff" —
the "f" sound. So, instead of: "vvv",

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,710
the same position and vibrating — that
extra "f" reminds me it's an "f", so I

23
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:53,160
have to go: "fff", as in: "free" or
"Frank". Cool? Well, this one doesn't

24
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,300
have that extra "f", so I know it's a:
"vvv" sound, like: "vibrate" or "visit".

25
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,010
That'll make it a bit easy. And then at
the end, I'm going to go over what we

26
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,760
call the reduction of "of", which gives
you a little bit more to play with to

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,330
get much more like a native speaker. All
right? But let's go through this.

28
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,870
They're both prepositions, to start off
with. So, that is one thing they have in

29
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,260
common, and that's what leads to some
confusion because if you do not

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,860
pronounce.  pronounce it properly, you
probably aren't aware when you're

31
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,880
writing it down, because they're both
prepositions, that you're using them

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,070
incorrectly. Now, with "of", it's
strict-.  it's strictly a preposition

33
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,360
all the way down. "Off" is a preposition
— we use it in phrasal verbs — but it

34
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,870
also has adverbial and an adjective
meaning, and we'll go over all of those

35
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,380
together. But let's start over here. Now
that we've got it down that what they

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,160
sound like; the difference, and we're
saying they're both prepositions, let's

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,910
go through.  see how this is further a
preposition, and the differences we'll

38
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,680
find on "off". Okay?

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,450
So, "of" is a preposition expressing a
relationship or a connection between

40
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,870
things; so, they go together. And you
can use it like this, an example would

41
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,250
be a bottle on a cap — there's a
connection. This is very different from

42
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,650
this, but one twist of the lid, and I
can carry my drink because of the

43
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,760
connection that they make. And that's
what "of" does — it shows us connections

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,190
between things. Now, in this case, it
expresses relationship. So, we can say:

45
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,230
"the husband of my friend". Right? I
know many people, but this is the

46
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,650
husband of my friend. That's the
connection — friendship, and they're

47
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:31,780
married. Next: "It's on the top of the
page." Well, when you have a book or a

48
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,170
magazine, if it's on the top of the
page, it's connected. Right? The words

49
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,480
are on the page; the top of the page.
So, we've demonstrated relationship

50
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,840
here, and connection here. What else?

51
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:52,420
We can indicate material. What does that
mean? Well, things are not just things;

52
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,030
they're made of things. For instance,
when I showed you the water, the water

53
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:04,060
is made.  this water bottle is "made of
plastic". The material is plastic. "It's

54
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,990
made of plastic." I can also say,
because I think I've had that one there:

55
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,970
"It's made of glass." I can also say
something, a small piece could be: "a

56
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,870
piece of glass". Because there is a lot
of glass in the universe, this is one

57
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,560
piece. I usually like to say when we
talk about relationship, and this goes

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,060
something of material, that when you
say: "of", it's one piece of a larger

59
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,480
thing. In this case, in the
relationship, there's two people, so

60
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,020
it's a larger thing and they're
connected; relationship. In this.  in

61
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,130
this case, glass — "made of glass" —
there's glass in the universe, and this

62
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,300
thing is made of some of that glass; one
piece or some of that. Okay?

63
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,030
We can also use "of" to express
direction. This is a strange one because

64
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,210
a lot of students aren't aware of it,
but if I go: "It's north of the city",

65
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,320
or east.  In this case, I say: "north
of the highway". So, if the highway's

66
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,730
here, keep going this way — that's where
I live; "north of the highway". And if I

67
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,170
say: "east of something", I might go:
"Oh, go east of. " So, "east of th

68
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,800
 city" — you find the location, city, g
 east of that direction, so go aroun

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,790
 that corner. So, we use it t
 indicate.  express direction, we us

70
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:15,460
 "of" to indicate what type of materia
 something is — "made of cotton". Okay

71
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,340
 As I showed: "made of plastic". W
 expressed relationships: "my.  a frien

72
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,600
 of my brother's" — right? — or we ca
 show a connection: "on the top of th

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,400
 page". And that's when we use "of". An
 remember, because it only has one "f"

74
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,760
 we use the "v" sound for "vibrate" 
 it's in the same position as the "f'

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,230
 but we vibrate it instead of: "fff", le
 the air flow. Cool? All right

76
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:50,170
"Off", "off", "soft". A soft "f" sound;
not like the bad "f" word. I knew you

77
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,220
were going there. It's a preposition.
So, how does it work as a preposition?

78
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,440
When we use it as a preposition, it
expresses: "away from" or "down". So,

79
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:07,660
I'm here — it'd be away from or down.
Okay? So: "It rolled off the table."

80
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,410
Okay? So, when something rolls off the
table, it's going away from the table.

81
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,710
In this case, it's not only just going
away from the table, it's going down.

82
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,940
So, I've connected the two of them. I
wish I could turn off that extra sound

83
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,950
that just happened. Anyway. Next.

84
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,950
We also can use it as an adverb. And an
adverb, as you know, is how something is

85
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:31,930
done. So: "he took off his coat", we
actually mean: "he removed it". So, he

86
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,530
moved it; removed it from himself. "He
took off his coat" and that's the

87
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,640
adverbial or an example of an adverb
that you'll use. What about an

88
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,100
adjective? And this is interesting,
because people who are native speakers,

89
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,280
you know, in Australia, or Canada, and
whatnot, they know this, but it would. 

90
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,540
I understand it sounds strange to
somebody who English isn't their first

91
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:57,130
language. Because: "a bit off", what
does that mean? Well, this is describing

92
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:02,170
something. And it means it's not.  When
we talk about: "food is a bit off", it

93
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,640
means the food isn't at its perfect
state; maybe it's a little bit bad. So,

94
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,640
the milk: "Oo, it's a bit off." It's not
any good.

95
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,880
Now, a person can be "a bit off". It's
like: "I'm feeling a bit off today",

96
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:17,530
meaning: "I don't feel very good. I'm
not feeling my normal self." Now, if

97
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:22,120
that extends to: I'm not doing, you
know, my usual self with a job I'm doing

98
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,220
— when my whole day is like that, I can
say: "I'm having an off day." So, if

99
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:32,200
you've got a.  Michael Jordan, I can at
least say that because he was the

100
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,040
greatest — probably is — basketball
player. If he's having an "off day", he

101
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,540
may not get 50 or 60 points, or 100
points; maybe he only gets 10 points.

102
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,730
So, he's "having an off day". Now,
here's the funny thing: I can feel "a

103
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,990
bit off", like, I don't feel so good
today, but still have a good day. But by

104
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,580
saying: "I'm a bit off" means I'm not
feeling my normal self. To have the "off

105
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:59,320
day", remember, it means the whole day
is not going well. And don't forget: You

106
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,860
can also use this for food. "That tastes
a little bit off, smells a bit off" — it

107
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,860
means it doesn't.  it's not really
good. Something's wrong; it's not at its

108
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,230
perfect state, or a good state to eat.

109
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,260
Now, I'm going to give you something, as
I said, to help you further

110
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,690
differentiate, because we have the
reduction of "of". I kept it at the end

111
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,080
because I want to make sure you get the
meanings, because if you get that. 

112
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,660
this — you're doing pretty well. And if
you could say: "one of this" or "one of

113
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:35,350
that", it's okay. But seeing as I'm here
to help you out, because I like you, I

114
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,350
wanted to give you something a little
bit better and show you when native

115
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,019
speakers take "of" and they change it.
Now, there's an old Three Musketeers

116
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,100
thing, and it goes: "All for one, and
one for all". And "all for one" means,

117
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,510
like, everybody in the group — right? —
will support one person, and "one for

118
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,840
all" — that person in the group will
help.  one person will help support the

119
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,200
group.

120
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,700
I've got a really corny, stupid saying,
but I was thinking about it and it goes

121
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:08,080
like this: "'v' for 'vowel' and 'a' for
'fff'". That's why it's Three

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,270
Musketeers; they didn't invite me to the
party. Okay? So, what do I mean by that?

123
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,510
Well, in the reduction, what happens is
when you have a vowel that follows "of"

124
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,380
— okay? — so, I'll give you an example
here, because I wrote one on the board.

125
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,950
You can see this, but you won't see it
unless I do this. So: "one ov ours".

126
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,900
That's really this: "one of ours". Okay?
But because a vowel follows here — okay?

127
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,750
— in English, we reduce it to: "one ov
ours", "one ov ours". "That soldier,

128
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:46,960
he's one ov ours." Okay? It's reduced to
a "v", or the "v" sound from "of", and

129
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,170
that's why I started with that in the
first place. I needed to get that in

130
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,540
your head, so when I do this, you'll go:
"Okay, I got it."

131
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,440
So, what's the "'v' for 'vowel' and 'a'
for 'vvv'"? Well, I kind of lied. Now,

132
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:10,300
watch this. If it's followed by not just
the "t–⁠h" I said the "t–⁠h", because

133
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,900
basically every "t–⁠h" will work with
this rule. But if it's got a consonant

134
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,490
after, so that could be: "b", "c", or
"d" — any consonant — it changes to an

135
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:24,430
"a" sound. So, we say: "one a them".
Right? "He's one ov ours, and she's one

136
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,900
a them." You go: "What? But that has
nothing to do with. " Yeah, but that's

137
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,310
how we do it — we do reduction. I have a
video where I talk about listening

138
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:39,370
skills, and how you have to watch for
reduction in words. And also, you have

139
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:44,140
to watch out for joining words; linking
words. It seems the same, but it's not.

140
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,310
In this case, there's not a linking;
there's a reduction. And sometimes the

141
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:52,150
linking and reduction go together. I
know, nightmare. That's why it's

142
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:55,990
difficult to learn listening in English,
but it's paying attention to things like

143
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,920
this that will help you.

144
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,320
See, when I'm teaching you to say: "of",
I want you to say: "one of them". You

145
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,820
need the practice of proper
pronunciation. Okay? You do. What I'm

146
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,020
teaching you, this reduction, is because
you need to be able to understand a

147
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,170
Canadian, or American, or British
speaker when they speak — you think

148
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,920
quickly, but it's not. You're kind of
right; it's quick because they do these

149
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,420
reductions that you're not doing. So, by
making you say this, you'll be clearly

150
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,780
understood, which is what you really
want. You don't want people saying:

151
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:29,890
"What? What did you say?" By teaching
you to do this, you won't be going: "I

152
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,070
don't understand. Can you repeat? Can
you repeat?" because it's a native

153
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,210
speaker of English.

154
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:39,190
A native speaker in any language finds
it really kind of annoying when they

155
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,150
have to repeat themselves over, and
over, and over again. So, I'm going to

156
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,080
reduce that for you by teaching you this
reduction, so that people will like to

157
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,290
speak to you wherever they're from,
simply because they're not repeating

158
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:54,490
themselves over and over. Cool? So, now
you know my little secret. And what is

159
00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:01,840
it? It is.  Right? "v" for vowels. If
it's.  if the "of" is followed by a

160
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,880
vowel, you put "v", and "a" for — and I
said "the", but you know, really, it

161
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,110
means consonant — if the word is
followed, if "of" is followed by a

162
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,370
consonant word, then you put the "a"
instead. In the examples I gave you,

163
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,960
they were almost the same: "One ov ours,
one a them", and you can literally see

164
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,370
what I'm talking about. Speaking of
"literally see", I want to literally see

165
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,300
if you understand what I taught you, and
we're going to have a test. And what of

166
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,830
it? Hey, yeah. (snaps)

167
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:37,070
And we're back. Viva Las Vegas. The
first question on the board. So, it's

168
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,580
time to do the test. Now, we're going to
do two parts of this. The first we're

169
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,840
going to put: What is the correct
preposition — is it "of" with one "f" or

170
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,410
"off"? And if you remember what I said,
the second "f" reminds you to go: "fff".

171
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,910
Like: "fff it". Playing with you. Okay,
so with a double "f" will be that soft

172
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,890
sound, and the single "f" would be the
"v" sound, or what? It could be an "a"

173
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:06,440
sound. We talked about the reduction,
remember? So, if a vowel follows "of",

174
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,890
we're going to use the "v" sound; and if
it's a consonant, we're going to use the

175
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,310
"a" sound. And we're going to work on
that because I'm going to fill it in,

176
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,400
and you're going to try and figure out
what the reduction would be, and

177
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,210
whether.  whether it's an adverb, or a
preposition, or an adjective. Remember?

178
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,250
Remember that "of" is usually — no,
sorry — always a preposition; and then

179
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,240
when we use "off", it can be adverb,
adjective, or preposition. Let's go to

180
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,660
the board.

181
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,270
First question, as I said, Viva Las
Vegas. "Toronto is north ____ Las

182
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:45,650
Vegas." That's right. "North of Las
Vegas." And would that be. ? And that's

183
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:51,440
with one "f", right? "North of Las
Vegas". And would that be an adverb,

184
00:13:51,710 --> 00:14:00,380
preposition? Okay, you're already ahead
of me. Right? It is a preposition.

185
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,950
Right? We talked about direction —
direction using.  we can use the

186
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:08,960
preposition "of" for direction. What's
the next one? "I didn't play well. I'm

187
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:23,180
having an ____". That whining, it's my
belly. I need food. "I'm having an off

188
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,200
day." I'm hungry. See? That: "Wanh,
wanh, wanh, wanh, wanh". That's the

189
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,030
"o-f-f", "off", "soft". Right? An "off
day". And what would that be? Would this

190
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:39,080
be adjective, adverb, or preposition?
That's right — it's describing the type

191
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,490
of day, so we're looking at an
adjective. It's an adjective.

192
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,830
And I got a quick quiz for you. How can
we reduce this one up here? How would we

193
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:54,430
reduce it? Yeah, it would be: "northa
Las Vegas. Northa, northa", with the "a"

194
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,050
sound because this is a consonant. Good.
You're learning — I like that. Let's do

195
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:05,950
number three. "He took ____ his hat in
the restaurant." Oo, that's an ugly

196
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:13,120
sentence. So, what did we say? "He took
his hat in his restaurant"? "took off".

197
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,710
Now, what is that: "to take off your
hat", that would be, what? We did an

198
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:22,690
example earlier. That's right, "to
remove", and removing is a way of doing

199
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,750
something — a verb describing, so it
would be an adverb. I like this. I like

200
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,620
this. We're getting there.

201
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:44,300
Now, number four. "I would love a glass
____". "of milk". Right? A "glass of

202
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,320
milk" showing a relationship or a
connection. Right? Glass with milk. And

203
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,730
what would that be? Yep, because we know
this one is a preposition. And finally,

204
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,370
Piglet. I love Winnie the Pooh — one of
my favourite books — by A. A. Milne. And

205
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,360
Piglet's got a house. What's Piglet's
house made of? -"I don't know, Pooh.

206
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,210
What's the house be made of?" -"Here,
Piglet". "Piglet's house was made of",

207
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,610
whoop. I almost told ya. Hahaha. Yeah,
you got it right. "It's made of wood".

208
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,120
Remember we talked about what type of
material something's made of? "made of

209
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:29,510
wood", so we know the material it's made
of. And that's also a preposition. Okay.

210
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,220
And how would you say that, because this
has a consonant after that? Would it be

211
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,930
"made v" or "made a wood"? Yeah. A North
American or Eur-.  Sorry. An

212
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,150
English-speaking, native
English-speaking person goes: -"It's

213
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,620
made a wood." -"What's the house made
of?" -"It's made a wood." Good. So, now

214
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,790
we've done our reduction. We remember
whether it's a preposition, or it's

215
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,290
adverbial, or it's an adjective. We've
worked in all of that. I want to give

216
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:00,950
you some other things with "of" and
"off", that are in English. And I'm

217
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:06,079
going to explain. There are simpler ways
of saying some of these, but you may run

218
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,689
into people saying it and you should
know what they are. Okay?

219
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:13,119
So, the first one we're going to look at
"of": "out of". "out of" really means

220
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:17,470
"out" because it's the opposite of "in".
So, "out of" means.  is the opposite of

221
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,490
"in". And people will say, like: "Get
out of the rain. Get out of the rain."

222
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,990
You can say.  Well, it's really
difficult to say anything. It's so, so

223
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:30,370
customary for us to say: "Get out ov the
car". Right? "Get out of the car", that

224
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,730
"out" and "of" go together. We got these
two prepositions to tell us: Well, it's

225
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,660
the opposite of "in". So, you don't just
say "out", you say: "out of". Cool?

226
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:47,530
Opposite of "in". Next: "off of". Now,
this is okay to say, but please do not

227
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,310
put it in formal writing. It's.  a lot
of people say it and there are times we

228
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:56,050
say it when we want to make emphasis.
Example: You have a little boy or girl

229
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,870
on the table, and they're dancing on
your kitchen table, you say: "Hey! Get

230
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:04,270
off of the table!" You should just say:
"Get off the table." Right? But "getting

231
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,300
off of the table" gives it a little bit
more umph. Like: "Get off of the table".

232
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:10,810
"Get off of my back". "Get off my back"
is simple enough, but some people will

233
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:15,220
say this to put some emphasis on it. And
it is the opposite of "on". If you're on

234
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,260
the table: "get off of the table". Okay?
Opposite of "on".

235
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,190
And, finally: "offed". This is a weird
one. Not really weird. You'll see it in

236
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,410
a lot of police movies or dramas, it's
like: "He was offed by the criminal."

237
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:34,160
You go: "What do you mean, 'offed'?"
Remember we say: "off" is the opposite

238
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,060
of "on"? Well, when you kill somebody;
first I'm alive — I'm on — you kill me,

239
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:45,020
I'm off. So: "The criminal offed the
snitch." If you don't know what a

240
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:50,720
"snitch" is, a "snitch" is someone, if
we.  they tell the police what criminal

241
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,040
activities someone has done. They
snitch. It doesn't always have to be a,

242
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,090
you know, a police thing. You could have
a friend who snitched on you to your

243
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:03,380
girlfriend, and they told that you were
at the club drinking. And you go: "Why

244
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,680
did you snitch on me?" Right? So, in
this case: "The criminal offed the

245
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,580
snitch" — the snitch told somebody he
shouldn't have spoken to, and he got

246
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,770
killed. So, this is your bonus — giving
you three ways you may say "off" that

247
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,940
isn't quite in the preposition,
adjective, adverb way I've taught you,

248
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,550
but in colloquial or common speech. You
like that? Good. I try to deliver

249
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,560
because you guys deserve it. All right?

250
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,450
As.  as I wrap this up, or you know,
before I get out of here, I would like

251
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,740
to give you a quiz. Before I do that, I
want to say thank you, as always. Thank

252
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:41,940
you for being part of this. I don't
always say it every video, but I try to.

253
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:47,340
I appreciate that you take the time to
study with me and with engVid. Okay? And

254
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:52,440
never.  I never stop appreciating that.
So, in saying that, I'm giving you

255
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,580
homework. It's like: "What!? How. ?
That's not a thank you!" It is — you get

256
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,900
to practice, and practice again when I
get back in a second. But first, your

257
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,620
first question is: "They killed"
something and I want you to use either

258
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,930
the preposition "of" or the preposition
"off" to finish this statement. "They

259
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:16,200
killed" something — one of these — "all
of the animals in the rain forest." I've

260
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,510
given you a little bit of a help.
Because I'm not a bad guy, I've helped

261
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,940
you a little bit. You're going to have
to figure that out. And then I want you

262
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,410
to put down: Is it a preposition, is it
an adverb, or is it a. ? Sorry.

263
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,700
Preposition, adverb, or adjective. Okay?
So, put the answer, and then beside it

264
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,830
put: "adjective", "preposition", or
"adverb".

265
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,310
Next: "She is the top ____ her class."
Once again, you're going to put in the

266
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:43,870
proper preposition — if it's "off" or
"of"— and then you're going to put down

267
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,430
if this is adverb, or adjective, or
prep-.  Sorry. Adverb, preposition, or

268
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,420
adjective. Now, for this particular
quiz, because this is a little bit

269
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:58,150
difficult, I'm going to say: This quiz
is worth 1,000 points for each one you

270
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,650
get correct. Yay! And I would like you
to put it in the comments below, whether

271
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,010
that's on YouTube or on engVid. A lot of
students give you the thumbs up or the

272
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,460
thumbs down, and you get to know, you
know, how good you actually are. If you

273
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,240
want to take one step further, make a
few sentences using the different

274
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,070
meanings that I taught you in this
particular lesson.

275
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,860
Now, to finish off my gift to you,
because I love you so much, I want you

276
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:26,580
to go to www. "eng" as in English, "vid"
as in video.com, where there will be

277
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:30,180
another question, another, other quest-,
quiz and other great teachers for you to

278
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,530
learn from. Hope you've enjoyed this
lesson. And am I missing anything? Yes,

279
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,220
I got a quote for this. If you remember
what I talked about "of" it shows about

280
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,030
relationship between things, like
materials, peoples, and whatnot — here's

281
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:48,180
my quote: "A great relationship is about
two things. First, it's appreciating the

282
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,530
similarities between things; and second,
it's about respecting the differences."

283
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,920
I hope you take that quote, not just
from the lesson I produce, showing how

284
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,470
there is a connection, but take that
great relationship, and the respect, and

285
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,370
the appreciation in the relationships
you have with the people you know. All

286
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:08,670
right? And actually, some people you
don't know — make the world a better

287
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:15,750
place. Anyway, it's been fun. It's my
time off. Ah, no reduction. See you.
