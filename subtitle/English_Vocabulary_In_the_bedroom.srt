00:00:02,788 --> 00:00:11,843
Hello. Welcome to my bedroom. It's not my bedroom.
It's a whiteboard with words on it,

2
00:00:12,226 --> 00:00:22,140
but I'm going to teach you about bedroom -- vocabulary that is.
Stay tuned. Maybe I'll teach you

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:29,352
some other bedroom vocabulary if you know what I mean.
We're going to go on the innocent

4
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:37,478
side today, and I'm going to teach you about
basic things in bedrooms. I know. I know.

5
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:46,147
Okay. This is a bed. Do
you sleep on a bed, or do

6
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:52,809
you sleep on a futon? Did I speak Japanese?
Hi, Japanese people in the house. Konnichiwa.

7
00:00:52,809 --> 00:01:00,250
O-genki desu ka? When you sleep, you usually
sleep on a "futon". We have stolen your word.

8
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:07,020
We're so nice. And we use it for our own.
"Futon" -- if you know or don't know -- is,

9
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,380
basically, a mattress that you put on the floor.
It sounds kind of uncomfortable, but

10
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,060
it's really, really good if you're really
drunk, and there's never a fear of falling

11
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,140
out of the bed. You just kind of roll over and,
boom, you're awake. It has some advantages

12
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:30,500
and some disadvantages. So this is a picture of a bed.
I am an artist. Remember this as

13
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,110
we go through this. The first
very common thing that you will

14
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,090
find in a bedroom is a pillow. "Pillow". A
lot of people -- I don't know why -- have

15
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:46,430
never learned this word in English. I know
it's not in a lot of textbooks. You don't

16
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:50,890
open your textbook and go, "Wow, this is a
pillow." You're more like, "This is a pen."

17
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:56,909
Thanks. I know that. So the first one is a pillow.
A "pillow" is a soft or hard, squishy

18
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:05,298
thing that you put your head on -- not that head; this head.
And to keep your pillow clean,

19
00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:12,461
you're going to put a pillow case on it. A
"pillow case" is like a cover for the pillow.

20
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:19,475
You can take the pillow case off, and please wash it.
You can have different kinds of pillows.

21
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:27,187
There're feather pillows. So what we do is
we take a duck or a goose; we kill it; we

22
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:32,748
take all its feathers off; and we stick them in a pillow.
Yeah. I don't think that's really

23
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:41,964
cool. Or you can just have a fluffy cotton
pillow or another microfibre pillow. You have

24
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,119
a pillow case. The next thing
that is essential for a bed

25
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:51,730
-- please -- are sheets. Now be careful with
your pronunciation. You don't want to say

26
00:02:51,730 --> 00:03:01,061
"shits". That's the stuff that comes out of your bum.
You want to say "sheets". When you

27
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:10,676
say this, the "e's" are very long. So you're
going to say "sheets". Usually, we have a

28
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:17,389
top sheet and a fitted sheet. The fitted sheet
just means it's the bottom sheet. They like

29
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:22,219
to use fancy words like fitted sheet, top
sheet -- just two sheets. And you know what?

30
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:28,500
You can use just two of these. Don't worry about it.
The top sheet -- it goes on top.

31
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:35,303
And the fitted sheet goes on the bottom. It
covers -- the main part of your bed here is

32
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:44,233
a mattress. The "mattress" is, like, a big
fluffy thing that you get to relax on. And

33
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:51,269
the black part of my picture would be a bed frame.
Let's write that down. It's important.

34
00:03:52,540 --> 00:04:06,192
So a "bed frame" is the support of the mattress.
Pillow, pillow case, sheets, top and bottom

35
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:11,109
or fitted sheets. Next: In Canada,
or maybe in your country,

36
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:21,050
in the winter, it's cold. You want something to cover you.
Sheets are very thin. They're

37
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:34,953
usually made of cotton. A "cover" or a "blanket",
a "duvet" -- du-what? This word is a French

38
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,607
word. So the way that we say it looks very
different from the spelling. It looks like

39
00:04:41,646 --> 00:04:49,389
"duvette". I think that maybe some people --
especially people in America -- would say,

40
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:56,250
"I got a new duvette cover. It's got some
'dubyas' on it." It's actually very important

41
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:04,146
that you say this properly and you say "duvet".
So it's like "du-vay".

42
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:14,949
The next one is a comforter. "Comforter",
"duvet", "blanket", "cover", and the last

43
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:26,136
one, a "quilt" -- they're all the same. Don't
tell people who like to design beds and fabrics

44
00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:33,219
that it's just something that keeps you warm.
There are slight differences between a quilt,

45
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,120
a comforter, and a duvet, but you can discover
that for yourself. You've got homework. Go

46
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:45,818
to a store. Ask the people that work there
to show you a quilt, a comforter, a duvet,

47
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:49,268
a blanket, and a cover. You're
practicing your English.

48
00:05:50,518 --> 00:06:01,206
The next thing that you would have in your bedroom
is furniture. "Furniture" is an uncountable

49
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:12,115
noun. "Furniture" includes a bed, a nightstand --
"Ronnie, what's a 'nightstand'?" Oh, "standing

50
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:19,020
up", "nighttime" -- what? No. A nightstand or
-- maybe this makes more sense -- a bedside

51
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:29,388
table. Look at my picture. This thing right
here is a "bedside table". It's beside your

52
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:37,417
bed, and it's a table. I know. Sometimes English makes sense.
"Nightstand" or "bedside table"

53
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:43,229
-- these are the same. Some people say "nightstand";
some people say "bedside table". Some people

54
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:50,486
just say "that thing beside the bed". But it
is definitely a bedside table or nightstand.

55
00:06:50,963 --> 00:07:02,129
Also, we have "dresser" or -- long way to say
it -- "dresser drawers", or you can just

56
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:11,693
say "drawers". It's your choice. I naturally
would say "dresser". I would say, "I'm going

57
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:21,007
to put my clothes into the dresser." A "dresser"
is a piece of furniture that you put your

58
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,849
clothes into -- clean clothes, people. Don't
put your dirty socks in my dresser. So you're

59
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:34,981
going to put your beautifully folded up underwear
and socks into a dresser. Maybe above your

60
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:44,134
dresser you have a mirror. A "mirror" is something
that you look at and you can see yourself

61
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:50,169
-- your reflection. You see yourself in the mirror.
It's most common to have a mirror

62
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:56,719
in a bath -- bathroom. What? In the bedroom
and the bathroom as well. People like to look

63
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:00,499
at themselves, make sure
everything is in the right places.

64
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:11,696
This -- this contraption made by Satan is
called an "alarm clock". You might just know

65
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:18,240
the word "alarm". That's okay. You can just
say "alarm", but please, please, please, when

66
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:29,331
you say this word, do not say this word by mistake.
"Alarm clock". You have to -- right

67
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:36,640
there. If you say "alarm cock" -- "cock" means penis.
Don't say "alarm cock". You want to

68
00:08:36,693 --> 00:08:43,889
say "alarm clock". Alarm clock goes off when
it's time for you to get out of bed, go to

69
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:55,132
work, go to school. We have a magic button on the alarm clock.
And this is call a "snooze button"

70
00:08:55,168 --> 00:09:02,865
 or "snooze bar". A "snooze button" is magic.
It gives you ten long, luscious

71
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:11,645
minutes of extra sleeping time. So if your alarm
clock is set for 7:02, you hit the snooze,

72
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:21,895
and it will give you ten minutes more sleep.
You might hear people saying to their boss

73
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:28,899
-- the boss might say, "Why are you late?"
"I hit the snooze. I -- I -- I -- I just hit

74
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,010
the snooze five times. That's an hour, so I'm
late." Good excuse. If you're late, just

75
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:40,100
say, "I hit the snooze." And they're, like,
"Oh, yeah!" Okay? Danger button. Ten minutes

76
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,503
of lovely sleep. If you watch
a very popular TV show called

77
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:57,687
"Sex in the City" or any, I guess, TV show,
women -- mostly, ladies in the house -- are

78
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:06,488
going to go on about a "walk-in closet". Normally,
in houses, you're going to have a closet.

79
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:15,589
A "closet" -- it's like a little room. There's a door.
You open it, and inside is where we

80
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:23,265
hang our clothes. These are clothes. If you're
lucky enough to have a walk-in closet, it's

81
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:30,122
like a whole other entity or a whole other room.
A "walk-in closet" is, basically, a

82
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:38,575
room. And it is really, really big, and there're
lots of places to hang all of your clothes

83
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:48,760
that you never wear. So a "walk-in closet"
just means a "very big closet". In my house,

84
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:55,401
I have a closet. Don't open it, though. You
never know what's going to come flying out.

85
00:10:56,377 --> 00:11:01,926
Another word for "closet" is "cupboard", which
is very strange. The pronunciation of this

86
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:13,355
word is very strange. We say "kub burd", "cupboard".
It looks like "cup board". A long, long time

87
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:20,678
ago, we would definitely have a cupboard in our kitchen.
Now we have a cupboard in our

88
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,956
bedroom. So a "closet" and a "cupboard" are the same.
It's a place to put your clothes.

89
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:33,129
I hope you enjoyed the lesson. If you have
questions about your bedroom, ask me. Bye.
