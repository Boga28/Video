00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Vanessa: Hi, I'm Vanessa from 
SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. What's this part  

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:18,960
of my finger? What's this part of my ear called? 
Let's talk about it. Do you know this song? 

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,960
Theo: Head, shoulders, knee and toes, knees and 
toes. Eyes and ears and mouth and nose. Head,  

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,640
shoulders, knees, and toes, knee and toes.
Vanessa: A classic children's song. Today,

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,160
Just a little note before we get started this 
video, like almost every video on my channel is PG  

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,040
rated. This means that we are going to be talking 
about acceptable body part words to talk about  

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,560
in public. If you're looking for a biology 
lesson, this lesson is not for you, but if  

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,760
you would like an appropriate word that you can 
use without embarrassment in lots of situations,  

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,120
this lesson is the right place for you.
Not sure how to talk about something taboo  

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,760
politely, well, let's learn. Let's get started by 
talking about the top of our head and working down  

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:52,080
to our feet. Let's start with the head. There's 
a lot of words to talk about. This is my head.  

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,600
We have a great idiom that goes along with this, 
which is off the top of my head, I couldn't tell  

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,960
you how far the earth is from the moon. Off the 
top of my head, this means without doing research,  

20
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,400
just having the knowledge in my head. Off the top 
of my head, sorry, I couldn't tell you. I don't  

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:17,520
know. Off the top of my head, I have no clue. 
What's on my head? It's hair. So we could say I  

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,720
have brown hair, or I am a brunette. This is most 
often used for women. You could say it for men,  

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,240
but brunette is most often used for women.
Or we could say he has blonde hair. She or he  

24
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:42,720
is a blonde, or he has red hair. He's a red 
head. Or we sometimes say, he's a ginger.  

25
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,600
Sometimes people who have red hair, don't like 
this expression. My husband is a ginger and he  

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,720
doesn't care. This expression is fine with him. 
So maybe just listen out for it. Or you could  

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,840
just say, he's a red head. He has red hair, or 
he might have black hair. Under your hair we  

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,640
have your scalp. Your scalp is the skin under your 
hair. And then moving down, we have your forehead,  

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:20,000
forehead. Then we have your eyebrows, your 
eyebrows, your eye lids and your eyelashes. 

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,320
I want to take a quick note for my Asian 
followers. In the Asian world, it is somewhat  

31
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,480
common to talk about some different terms for 
your eyelids. When I lived in South Korea, I  

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,200
heard my Korean coworkers, when they were speaking 
in English, I heard them use the terms, mono lid  

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,200
and double eyelid in their English conversations. 
But I just want to let you know that this concept  

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,840
is relatively unknown to most of the English 
speaking world. This is something that's much  

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,520
more common in the Asian part of the world.
So if you were to have a conversation with  

36
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,440
someone in English and you said, yeah, 
he has a mono lid or a double eyelid,  

37
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,040
most other people in the Western world are not 
familiar with this concept. So we just call this  

38
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:20,160
the eyelid. These are my eyelids. My eyelids 
and my eyelashes protect my eyes, my eyes.  

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,480
There's a great idiom we sometimes use. Don't 
roll your eyes at me. Have you ever done that?  

40
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:31,680
Have you ever done that to your parents? If 
you have rolled your eyes at your parents,  

41
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,640
they most likely said to you 
don't roll your eyes at me. 

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,800
This is a common phrase that parents say to 
their children. Don't roll your eyes at me.  

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,920
That's rolling your eyes. Under my 
eyes, I have my cheeks, my cheeks.  

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,320
Babies have cute cheeks that we love to pinch, 
cheeks. And moving over here are my ears,  

45
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,400
my ears. So these are my ears, but this is 
my ear lobe. Some people have a pierced ear  

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,040
lobe. So I do. These are pierced ears and my ear 
lobe is pierced. There's another idiom we use,  

47
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:16,160
which is I'm all ears. If you have a suggestion 
for a YouTube video that you'd like me to make,  

48
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,320
I'm all ears. This means I'm willing to listen. 
I'm interested in what you have to say. I'm all  

49
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,880
ears. I have no mouth, no nose, no eyes. I'm 
all ears. I'm going to listen very carefully. 

50
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,840
And then we have my nose. This is called the 
bridge of your nose. And these are my nostrils,  

51
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,360
my nostrils. Under my nose is my mouth. This is 
the general word for this area, but there's a lot  

52
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,560
of specific words to talk about these parts. So 
let's talk about it. My mouth, my lips are on the  

53
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:02,640
outside, my lips. And when I open my mouth, there 
are my gums. The skin on the inside of my mouth is  

54
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:11,440
my gums. And then there's my teeth. And my tongue. 
There is some fun idioms we can talk about with  

55
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,480
the mouth. Let's say that you tell your friend 
that you're going to have a surprise birthday  

56
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,200
party for your sister. Your friend might say, oh, 
don't worry. I won't tell her. My lips are sealed. 

57
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,840
That means you can't open your mouth. My lips are 
sealed. The secret is safe with me. It's a great  

58
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,040
expression to let the other person know, don't 
worry. I'm not telling anyone. My lips are sealed.  

59
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:46,400
What do you do with your mouth? You eat. So if you 
love sweet things, maybe you have a sweet tooth.  

60
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,760
This doesn't mean just one of your teeth is sweet, 
but this just means I love sweet foods. Ugh,  

61
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,480
I have a sweet tooth, so I have to keep sweets 
out of my house or else I'll just eat them all  

62
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,320
the time. I have a sweet tooth. And before we move 
on to the rest of the upper body, let's talk about  

63
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,800
one more idiom about your tongue. This expression 
is extremely useful for English learners.  

64
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,520
What if I said to you, oh, what's the name of 
that movie with the pirate? Oh, it's on the tip  

65
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,880
of my tongue. Oh, do you get the idea that I know 
the movie. I just can't think about it right now. 

66
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,840
So the name of the movie with a pirate is right 
there. It's on the tip of my tongue. I just can't  

67
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,360
get it out. Oh, I just can't remember what's 
the name of that movie with the pirate. Oh,  

68
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,800
it's on the tip of my tongue. So if there is 
a word that you don't remember in English,  

69
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,520
you might say, oh yeah, the skin in your mouth. 
Oh, Vanessa talked about that. Oh, it's on the  

70
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,480
tip of my tongue. I forget what that word is. Oh, 
well, first of all, you remembered this idiom.  

71
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,080
That's great. And just to let you 
know, it's your gums, your gums,  

72
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,120
but this is a great expression to use when you 
know, you know a word, you just can't remember it. 

73
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,840
Under your mouth we have your chin, your chin. 
If I told you, keep your chin up, things will  

74
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,320
get better. Hmm. Keep your chin up. This is an 
encouraging statement that you can use to say,  

75
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,760
you can do it. Keep going. I know that it's tough 
right now, but find some positivity in this tough  

76
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:26,240
time. Keep your chin up. You can do it. Great 
encouragement. Under your chin, we have your neck,  

77
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,400
your neck and another wonderful idiom. What if I 
said for you I stuck my neck out for her because  

78
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:38,800
I felt like she did the right thing and she 
needed some support. I stuck my neck out for her.  

79
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,280
You're not literally sticking your neck out for 
her, but this has to do with the idea that you are  

80
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:51,280
supporting someone, even though you 
might face some criticism. So your  

81
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,040
head is very important to your body, right?
This is a really valuable part of your body.  

82
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,200
So when you stick your neck out, you are 
putting your head in a vulnerable position.  

83
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,320
You're sticking your neck out. You're not keeping 
it close to you. So that's the idea of this idiom.  

84
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,160
When you support someone, even though you 
might face some criticism, you could say,  

85
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,760
I stuck my neck out for her. Sometimes 
we use this if we regret it later, man,  

86
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,800
I stuck my neck out for her and she just didn't 
appreciate it at all. I stuck my neck out for  

87
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,320
her. I tried to support her, even though it wasn't 
the popular thing to do. And now I regret it. She  

88
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,880
didn't care at all. And it wasn't really helpful.
And finally, for your head, we can say your face,  

89
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,320
all of this right here is your face. Have you 
ever had a pretty rotten morning? Things just  

90
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,320
didn't go well. But when you walked into the 
office, you couldn't be grumpy. You couldn't be  

91
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,400
in a bad mood. You had to put on a face, this 
implies that things are going poorly, but you  

92
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,560
have to pretend like everything's fine. Sometimes 
we say I had to put on a happy face when I walked  

93
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,280
into the office. Or we could cut out the word 
happy completely and just say, I had to put on  

94
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:15,200
a face in front of the clients, even though I had 
just gotten yelled at by my boss. I wanted to cry,  

95
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,160
but I just had to put on a face when I talked with 
the clients. This is kind of a tough thing to do,  

96
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,560
but we all have to do it in lots of situations in 
life. Maybe you have to put on a face. All right.  

97
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,560
Let's go to the next section, which is 
not your head, which is your upper body. 

98
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:37,280
Now let's talk about the upper body, the upper 
body. These are my shoulders, my shoulders. If  

99
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:46,160
I'm angry at someone, I might give them the cold 
shoulder. Ooh. The cold shoulder is never good.  

100
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,800
That means that you ignore someone. You don't talk 
with them and you show them that you are angry by  

101
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,400
giving them the cold shoulder. You might 
not actually turn your body like this,  

102
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,200
but that's the expression we use. He gave me the 
cold shoulder after I told him what was going on. 

103
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:10,960
Below your shoulders is your chest, your chest. 
And this is the socially acceptable word for men  

104
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,120
and for women to talk about this 
area. We often use the term,  

105
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,280
ugh, I just have to get something off my 
chest. If there is a weight on your chest,  

106
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,800
it's a burden. It is not a good situation. But 
ugh, when you get something off your chest,  

107
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,520
you tell someone something important. Maybe 
you've been keeping in a secret and you finally  

108
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:40,720
can tell someone that you love that secret. 
Ah, I just have to get something off my chest.  

109
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,160
I love you. I've been wanting to tell 
you this for so long. Ah, I love you. Oh,  

110
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,920
it feels good to say it. I'm free now. So that's 
the idea of getting something off your chest. 

111
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,360
Under your shoulders, we have your arm pits, 
your arm pits, and they're connected to your  

112
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,560
arms, your arms. If you have to twist 
someone's arm to get them to do something,  

113
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,040
you had to work really hard to convince them. 
I had to twist my husband's arm to get a cat,  

114
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,120
but he finally said yes. And now he loves that 
cat. It's actually not true. He wanted to get  

115
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,680
a cat. He had to twist my arm to get a cat. It 
means, ugh. I had to convince him to get a cat.  

116
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:33,680
And now we have one. Wonderful.
On your arm, there is your elbow, your elbow.  

117
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:40,480
Sometimes we say, I need some elbow room, some 
elbow room. If you're cooking and all your kids  

118
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
are in the kitchen and everyone's moving around, 
you might say, Hey guys, I need some elbow room.  

119
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm trying to cook here. Can you guys just give 
me some space? That means I need some room,  

120
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:59,440
some elbow room. Attached to your arm, your elbow 
is your wrist, your wrist. This is the joint here.  

121
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,840
Your wrist. When I was in high school, I broke my 
wrist. It was literally and figuratively a pain.  

122
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,440
And then I have my hand, my hands. When 
you give someone a hand, you help them.  

123
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
Hey, can you give me a hand? This box is really 
heavy. I need some help picking it up. Hey, can  

124
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,440
you give me a hand and read over this report? I 
want to make sure I said it right. Give me a hand. 

125
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:32,400
And on my hand I have my Palm, my Palm, that's 
the bottom of your hand. And I have five fingers.  

126
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:41,440
Each of my fingers has a knuckle. My thumb 
has one knuckle notice the K is silent,  

127
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,080
but my other fingers have two knuckles, knuckles. 
You might see in a movie, we don't really use  

128
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,800
this in daily conversation, hopefully not too 
much, but you might see in a movie, someone say,  

129
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:58,480
do you want me to give you a knuckle sandwich? 
And that means, do you want me to punch you?  

130
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,080
Because your knuckles are like this. And it's 
a knuckle sandwich. Hopefully you don't use  

131
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,640
that a lot in daily life, but you might hear 
it in a movie. And now you'll understand it. 

132
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:17,200
Each of my fingers has a fingerprint and a 
fingernail, a fingernail. We have different names  

133
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:24,000
for each of our fingers. Do you know what they 
are? This is my pinky finger. Sometimes we say  

134
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,080
my little finger, but almost always do we say my 
pinky finger. My ring finger, and that's because  

135
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:40,400
we often put our wedding bands on this finger, 
my ring finger. My middle finger. In the west,  

136
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:48,480
maybe in other places as well, it's very rude to 
show only your middle finger. That means F you.  

137
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,160
I'm so angry at you. Here's my middle finger. So 
be careful not to do that. Do not point with your  

138
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,560
middle finger instead point with your pointer. 
That's what this finger's called. Point with your  

139
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,680
pointer. And then we have your thumb, your thumb.
All right. So we've talked about the hand,  

140
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,400
the arm, your chest. Sometimes we talk about 
this as your chest area, especially if we're  

141
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,680
being a little bit vague with women, you might 
say, oh, there's something on your chest area.  

142
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,920
Maybe there's like a stain on your shirt, but 
you don't want to point. You don't want to be  

143
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:27,760
rude. You might just say, oh, there's something on 
your chest area. It's not talking about your skin.  

144
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
It's just in this general area. So that's 
a very polite way to talk about this. 

145
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,960
And we sometimes use the term collar bone 
for this bone here, my collar bone. Oh yeah,  

146
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,760
I just slammed into a drawer and I hit my collar 
bone. It really hurts. This is my collar bone.  

147
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:52,000
Sometimes schools will have a dress code that 
says you need to cover your collar or bone.  

148
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,760
So that's what they're talking about. And in 
your chest area, we have your ribs, your ribs,  

149
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,400
that's the bones here. And sometimes we use the 
more technical term, your rib cage, your rib cage.  

150
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:12,000
I bruised a rib. Oh, that hurts my ribs. Oh, it 
hurts my ribs to laugh so much. This is your ribs. 

151
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,480
Below your ribs, you have your belly button. If 
you are human, you have a belly button. This is  

152
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,280
what connected you with your mother when you were 
in the womb, you have a belly button. And this  

153
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:30,160
area is usually called your stomach. But sometimes 
we call it your belly. This is especially for  

154
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:38,000
children. Aww, your belly hurts. Oh, this is my 
belly. But we often use an idiom that uses another  

155
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,240
word and that is your gut. Technically your gut 
is inside you. That's like your intestines and  

156
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,400
your organs inside you. We're not going to 
get to that. That's too detailed right now.  

157
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:56,240
But we sometimes use the phrase, trust your gut. 
This doesn't mean that you are using your rational  

158
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:03,600
brain. You're just trusting your instincts.
So if you thought, hmm, should I join Vanessa's  

159
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,400
course or not? Well, this is how much money it is. 
This is what I saw on the website. This is it. Now  

160
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,839
I'm just going to trust my gut. I know Vanessa 
is a nice teacher and I think it will be useful.  

161
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,839
I'm going to join the course. Great. Well, 
you can join The Fearless Fluency Club here.  

162
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,040
Trust your gut. That means I'm just 
going to trust my instincts and do it.  

163
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,440
All right. Let's move on from the head, the 
upper body and talk about the lower body. 

164
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:35,520
All right. Now let's talk about the lower 
body. These are my hips, my hips. And if  

165
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:43,920
you want to talk about this area in a polite 
daily conversation type way, we often just say  

166
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:49,120
private parts. This is something that's 
common for children to say. And I think  

167
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,920
this is something that's common for adults to say 
as well. Of course, we don't usually talk about  

168
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:01,040
this area in the workplace, just in general.
But if you are going to use a polite term,  

169
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:08,240
we would say private parts. We sometimes use 
the word crotch, but this is mainly for men.  

170
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,720
And it's mainly used to say, Hey, don't 
hit me in the crotch. Of course, talking  

171
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:21,920
about this area is not professional. So in the 
workplace, of course, none of these words apply,  

172
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,720
but in daily conversation, those are words you'll 
definitely hear, and they're not considered rude. 

173
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,960
You'll also hear the term groin used. And this 
specifically has to do with the muscles on the  

174
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,280
inside of your legs, like in this picture. And 
it's most commonly used to talk about when you  

175
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,800
hurt your groin. So you might say, ah, I pulled 
my groin when I was doing yoga yesterday. So  

176
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,600
it's used to talk about maybe some kind of pain. 
If you go to the doctor, you can use that term  

177
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,480
to talk about the muscles on the inside of your 
leg. I know that's a little technical, but you  

178
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,600
will use this and hear this in daily conversation. 
Ugh, I pulled my groin and now it hurts to walk. 

179
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:12,240
Next, let's talk about your legs. This is my leg 
and my knee, my leg and my knee. And here is my  

180
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,120
butt. This is the most general term that we use. 
But sometimes we use backside to be a little more  

181
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:27,280
polite. For my kids, we use the word bum. Wipe 
your bum. Don't put your bum on the table. We  

182
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,680
use those terms to be a little more indirect, 
but the most general you're going to hear is,  

183
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,760
butt. We often also use thigh to talk about the 
upper part of your leg, my thigh. Oh, I bumped  

184
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,320
my thigh on the table and it really hurts. Your 
thigh. Then below your knee, notice that the K  

185
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,000
is silent, below your knee is your shin.
Your shin, this is also a little bit of  

186
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,840
a technical term, but we often use shin when 
we're going to the doctor and saying, ah, yeah,  

187
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:04,000
I just really have some shooting pains in my shin. 
And I don't know what it is. This bone in the  

188
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,760
front is your shin. Behind your shin is your calf, 
your calf. Now, strangely enough, this is also the  

189
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:20,000
word for a baby cow. A baby cow is a calf, notice 
the L is silent, but this muscle here, back here  

190
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,880
is your calf. My calves are really sore after 
going on that hike. Ugh, my calves are so sore.  

191
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,880
Then we have your foot, your foot. Just like the 
hand, the foot has a lot of parts as well. We can  

192
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,840
talk about your ankle. Your ankle is the bone 
here. Don't twist your ankle. That hurts a lot. 

193
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:49,360
For your toes, we don't have a name for every 
individual toe. Maybe doctors do. I imagine  

194
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,920
doctors do, but in daily life, we just say your 
big toe and your little toe. The other toes are  

195
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,760
important, but we don't have a specific name for 
them. So it's your big toe and your little toe.  

196
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:08,720
Then we have underneath your foot is called 
the foot arch. And sometimes we say the arch  

197
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,520
of my foot. The arch of my foot hurts after 
walking for 10 hours yesterday, Ugh, my foot  

198
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:23,760
arch hurts or the arch of my foot. And the back 
of your foot here is called the heel. The heel,  

199
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:32,160
notice the spelling is different than to heal, 
the verb. So this is with two E's, heel. I hurt my  

200
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:40,640
heel and I hope it heals soon. That's your heel.
What would it mean if I said, I have a new  

201
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,880
job starting tomorrow and I'm going to put my 
best foot forward and be prepared for my job?  

202
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,080
To put your best foot forward doesn't really mean 
that one of your feet is better than the other.  

203
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,880
It just means I'm going to do my best. I'm 
going to do everything I can to make sure that  

204
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,840
there is success. I'm going to put my best foot 
forward. I'm going to wear professional clothes.  

205
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,840
I'm going to be in the right mindset. I'm going 
to get a good night's sleep the night before.  

206
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,960
I'm going to put my best foot forward. 
Excellent expression. Whew. That was a  

207
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,960
lot of body vocabulary words and idioms, but
