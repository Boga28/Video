1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,440
There are a lot of words 
where Americans would drop a T  

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,320
sound but Brits wouldn’t. For 
example, this word: Identify.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,960
Nine times out of ten, Americans 
won’t say that T. Identify.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,615
Brits will. 5 examples of 
Americans dropping this T.

5
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:30,481
5 examples of Brits pronouncing the T.

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,960
So we have identify, American and British.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,120
If you’re trying to master a natural 
sound in American English or you’re  

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,360
curious about the differences between 
American and British pronunciation,  

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,152
you’ll want to know this rule about T after N. 
What other words have a dropped T like this?

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,310
When a T comes after an N. What 
other words have a drop T like this?

11
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,800
When a T comes after an N 
before a vowel of diphthong,  

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,640
often, Americans won’t say that T at 
all but most of the time Brits will.

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,200
I’m going to give you lots of examples 
here so you’ll totally understand the rule,  

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,311
know the exceptions and start to build this habit.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
The first word we’re studying is 
“identify” and also “identification”.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,200
Identification, again,  

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,360
nine times out of ten an American speaker 
will drop that T sound but a Brit won’t.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,000
American English examples.

19
00:01:48,534 --> 00:01:50,034
British English examples. 

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,960
Identification or identification.

21
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,960
The next one. Now, you may have noticed 
this because it’s so common, twenty.

22
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,440
It’s very uncommon for an American 
to say the second T, [‘twen ti].

23
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,410
You’ll almost always heat it as [twen I].

24
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:36,480
Twenty, twenty, twenty. British English,  

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,747
sometimes they do this but most of 
the time it [‘twen ti] for them.

26
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,205
The next word group: wanted, 
want a and want another.

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,058
Wanted. Studying speakers from the UK, I 
noticed they will also drop this T sometimes.  

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,627
Often it’s a true T, wanted.

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,184
But not always. In American English 
however, 99% of the time, we’ll drop that T.

30
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:15,098
[‘wan id]

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,618
The first word we looked at, identify, 
had the nt plus vowel within the word.  

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,681
But this rule applies to 
linking words together as well.  

33
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:49,248
Want another, for example nt vowel. Americans 
will usually drop that T, Want another.

34
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:05,643
Want a. [‘wan ǝ]. Just like want to, [‘wan ǝ]

35
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,800
These are both examples of dropping 
the T after N before a vowel.

36
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,965
I want a Coke. That’s want a. I want a Coke.

37
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,519
I want to leave now. That’s want to.

38
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,790
I want to leave now.  

39
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,720
Want to, want to, these two phrases sound 
exactly the same with this reduction.

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,480
Speaking of sounds the same, 
the phrase we just studied,  

41
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,000
want another sounds just like this phrase.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,418
Want another, because of dropping the T.

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,222
I want another donut.

44
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,982
We have to love one another.

45
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,511
Want another

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,702
One another

47
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,258
I love this! Why do they sound the same?

48
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,459
Why drop the T? Doesn’t 
that make a word less clear?

49
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,880
In American English, huge priority 
is given to the smoothness of sound,  

50
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,200
the flow of sound, no interruption 
and linking between words.  

51
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,640
It’s one of the most important 
characteristics of spoken English.

52
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:10,640
So taking out, tt. A sharp sound. That stop of 
air with the escape, smooths it out. Removing  

53
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,843
that smooths it out. And that’s how this habit 
came about. Think about it. The position of the N,  nnn. 

54
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,350
very similar to the position of T , tt.

55
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,640
both have the front of the tongue 
at the roof of the mouth. N, T.  

56
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,530
So somewhere along the way, dropping that 
sharp stop to smooth out the sound came about.

57
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
There’s another word set where it’s 
common for Americans to drop the T  

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,634
especially in conversational English but 
even in more formal settings like speeches.

59
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,765
Count on

60
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,949
Counted

61
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,289
Counting

62
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,278
Counter

63
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,680
Counter. This is true especially in the 
phrase “kitchen counter”. For Americans,  

64
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,294
you’ll almost always hear that with no T.

65
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,141
Counter [‘kaʊn ər] Kitchen counter.

66
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,000
For British English, they 
will say that T. 

67
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,783
Counter. Counter.

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,360
Also the word “count”. Linking into a vowel.

69
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
Count on

70
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,391
I count on that money every month.

71
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,200
To count on something means to need 
it, to rely on it, to depend on it.

72
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,240
Say that with me.

73
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
Count on [‘kaʊn an]

74
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,654
Linked smoothly to the N, no 
T. Here’s some other examples.

75
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:36,960
Counted.

76
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:43,405
I counted twenty. How many did you 
count? Counted twenty, two dropped Ts.

77
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,525
Or counting. I’m counting on 
you or I’m counting on that.

78
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
Disappointed

79
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,200
Disappointing

80
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,334
Another word said where it’s pretty common 
for Americans to drop the Ts. Disappointed.

81
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,408
Disappointed. British probably won’t drop that T.

82
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,360
Also disappointing. No t a 
lot of the time for Americans.

83
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,725
But usually with a T for Brits.

84
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,280
Now there’s an exception to this rule.

85
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,120
We don’t do it if there’s a 
syllable break between n and t.

86
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,616
Into

87
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
Entry

88
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Antique

89
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,427
For example, T. Those all have that T sound.

90
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,800
More examples of dropping the T, we’ll go more 
quickly here. But first, I want to tell you about  

91
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,560
a new feature here on Youtube that allows you 
to give a super thanks donation to the channel.  

92
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,159
This helps me know what videos 
you really love and appreciate  

93
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,079
and help support the channel. For example, I’m 
currently looking to buy some camera equipment.  

94
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,680
So give a super thanks to your favorite video 
of mine, I appreciate it so much, your support.

95
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,240
Out next example, “pointed”.

96
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
Pointing. I pointed out that we don’t need that.

97
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,840
Is he pointing at me?

98
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,200
Now, this example and the ones coming 
up, it’s less common to drop the T.  

99
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,480
Yes you’ll hear it but only about half of the 
time. The rest of the time, you’ll hear a true  

100
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:11,538
T. This is different from identify or twenty 
where you’ll almost always hear the T dropped.

101
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,589
Printer

102
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,798
Printing

103
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,811
Printed

104
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,489
I need a new printer.

105
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,862
I’m printing it out after work.

106
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,845
I printed it already.

107
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,374
Paint. Followed by a word that begins with a 
vowel or diphthong also painted and painting.

108
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,920
I’m going to paint it pink.

109
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,562
Paint it.

110
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,445
What a beautiful painting. Or, we’re having 
the house painted while we’re on vacation.

111
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,674
Rented

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Renting

113
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,721
I rented a car for vacation.

114
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,440
Do they own their home? No, they’re renting.

115
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,565
This is also common with “inter”words. For 
example, Internation, Internet, Interview.

116
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,191
The internet is down.

117
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,071
She’s studying international affairs.

118
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,320
I have a job interview next week.

119
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,160
Accounting

120
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,934
Accounted

121
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,885
The accounting office is closed.

122
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,027
Everything is accounted for.

123
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,440
What do you think?

124
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,000
Do you like this rule? Do you hate it?

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
Have you noticed other words?

126
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,400
My boys are going to the dentist next week. 
And I noticed myself dropping that T, dentist.

127
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,280
Can you think of another situation 
that follows this rule of NT plus  

128
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,080
a vowel or diphthong where the T can be dropped?

129
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Or an example you’ve heard and 
noticed. Put it in the comments below.
