00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,510
- [Narrator] Gadoosh.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:04,093
(classic rock)

3
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:16,628
(toilet flushing)

4
00:00:16,628 --> 00:00:18,461
- Oh, you're terrible!

5
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:23,539
(portal opening)

6
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:24,696
- Wait!
(gasping)

7
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:25,750
Stop!

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,947
Don't eat that food!

9
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:27,780
- Who are you?

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,231
What are you doing in our house?

11
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,767
- I'm from the future.

12
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,210
I'm here to warn you, don't eat that food.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,043
- Why not?

14
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:37,204
- The eggs, they're full of cholesterol.

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,037
- What?

16
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:41,078
- Cholesterol it,

17
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:42,549
it clogs up your arteries.

18
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:44,438
Eating even just one egg can dramatically

19
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:46,315
increase your chance of heart attack.

20
00:00:46,315 --> 00:00:47,273
Don't eat eggs!

21
00:00:47,273 --> 00:00:48,107
- Oh, my God.

22
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:49,165
Thank you.

23
00:00:49,165 --> 00:00:50,339
- You're welcome.

24
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:51,571
Godspeed.

25
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:54,457
(dramatic music)

26
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:57,207
(portal closing)

27
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,661
- Well I guess I better take those eggs.

28
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,499
(portal opening)

29
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:03,544
- Wait!

30
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:04,441
Stop!

31
00:01:04,441 --> 00:01:05,274
- [Woman] You're back!

32
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:08,069
- Yeah, we were wrong about the eggs.

33
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:08,983
- How?

34
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:11,192
- Well it turns out there's
two types of cholesterol.

35
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:13,645
There's good cholesterol
and bad cholesterol,

36
00:01:13,645 --> 00:01:15,615
and eggs actually have both.

37
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:19,176
So you can eat eggs but just
don't eat the egg yolks.

38
00:01:19,176 --> 00:01:21,186
So stick with the egg whites.

39
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:22,021
- Yes, thank you.

40
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:22,883
- Godspeed!

41
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:25,638
(intense music)

42
00:01:25,638 --> 00:01:28,388
(portal closing)

43
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,849
(portal opening)

44
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:32,296
Wait!

45
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:33,645
We were wrong about the eggs.

46
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:34,599
- Again?

47
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,699
- Yeah.

48
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:38,459
Yeah, okay so it turns out
that the amount of cholesterol

49
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,983
in a food doesn't actually
affect how much cholesterol

50
00:01:41,983 --> 00:01:43,390
ends up in your blood.

51
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,326
The eggs are probably fine.

52
00:01:45,326 --> 00:01:47,484
In fact we sort of don't even know what. 

53
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:48,709
cholesterol is.

54
00:01:49,463 --> 00:01:51,386
But the steak!

55
00:01:51,386 --> 00:01:52,586
You can't eat the steak!

56
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:53,886
- Why not?

57
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:55,197
- Turns out that red meat increases

58
00:01:55,197 --> 00:01:56,450
your chance of heart attack.

59
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,720
You have to cut out red meat.

60
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,720
So no steak!

61
00:02:00,065 --> 00:02:01,138
- Thank you.

62
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:01,971
- Godspeed.

63
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:04,811
(intense music)

64
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:05,644
- What, no.

65
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:07,061
No steak, Mister.

66
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:10,310
- Wait.

67
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:12,225
(portal opening)

68
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:13,058
- Wait!

69
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:16,410
We were wrong about the steak!

70
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,071
It's the toast.

71
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,897
Man was not meant to eat bread.

72
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:22,078
- What do you mean man was
not meant to eat bread?

73
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:23,130
- Well if you think about it,

74
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,312
human beings should really only be eating

75
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:28,066
what our paleolithic ancestors ate.

76
00:02:28,066 --> 00:02:31,135
So, therefore, no bread, no toast.

77
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:35,051
- How do you know what our
paleolithic ancestors ate?

78
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:37,467
- Well, we just have to guess.

79
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:41,634
Right, I mean we don't have
any way of knowing wha-

80
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:48,022
(portal closing)

81
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:53,712
(sighing)

82
00:02:53,712 --> 00:02:54,545
(portal opening)

83
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:55,378
- Woo!

84
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:59,234
Okay, went back to the paleolithic.

85
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,813
They are. 

86
00:03:01,813 --> 00:03:02,646
not

87
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,005
doing well.

88
00:03:04,964 --> 00:03:07,202
I don't know what we were thinking.

89
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:10,728
If anything we should all
be eating a lot more bread.

90
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:11,834
Geez!

91
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:13,584
So I guess just um,

92
00:03:13,584 --> 00:03:16,906
ignore everything I've said and exercise.

93
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,649
- Exercise, okay.

94
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:19,539
- Yeah.

95
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,454
You guys could probably use it.

96
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:23,153
You've been sitting just sitting
here for the last 35 years.

97
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,842
- It's been five minutes.

98
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:27,126
- Right.

99
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:28,959
Time travel.

100
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,126
Alright, well,

101
00:03:31,205 --> 00:03:32,117
Godspeed!

102
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:35,192
(dramatic music)

103
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:37,668
(portal opening)

104
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:40,389
Turns out it's genetic.

105
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:44,556
Doesn't matter whether you
exercise or what you eat.

106
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,500
I'm sorry I ruined your meal.

107
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,943
- I need 10 minutes.

108
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,049
Woo!

109
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:01,278
- Do you want some eggs?

110
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:02,695
- I'd love some.
