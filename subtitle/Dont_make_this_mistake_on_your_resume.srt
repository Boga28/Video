00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:11,790
Attach resume and send. Okay, fingers
crossed. Hey, everyone. I'm Alex. Thanks

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:17,940
for clicking, and welcome to this lesson
on the most common mistake most people

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:24,690
make when they are writing their resume.
If you are looking for a new job, and

4
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,660
you are sending your CV to a potential
employer, of course, you want to talk

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:38,670
about what you did in your past jobs,
right? Now, employers, of course, they

6
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,460
will care about what you did, but they
will care more about what you achieved

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,100
at your job. So what is the most common
mistake people make? Well, let me step

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,000
away from the board just for a second.
And you see "task". And here you see

9
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,520
"achievement". So the main problem that
people have when they are writing about

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,880
their past jobs is that they write a
task-based resume, instead of writing an

11
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,400
achievement-based resume. I'm going to
tell you the difference in a moment. But

12
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,710
first, I want to tell you why an
achievement-based resume is superior to

13
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,610
only listing your tasks at a previous
job. So a task-based resume, it tells

14
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,610
the employer what you did at your past
jobs. It doesn't tell them what you

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,710
accomplished. Now, with an
achievement-based resume, you are

16
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,800
focusing on the results that you got at
your past jobs, and the contributions

17
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,860
that you made to your past employers.
Companies care about what you can bring

18
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,890
to their team. What will you accomplish
if you go and work for their company.

19
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,500
This is why an achievement-based resume
is vastly superior to a task-based

20
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,990
resume. Now, I don't want to say that
you can't talk about your tasks -- of

21
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,610
course, you will have to talk about some
of your tasks that you had, you know, at

22
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,340
your past jobs, because it's clearly
unavoidable. But if you can make the

23
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,550
bulk, the majority of your resume
achievement-based -- talk about results,

24
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,980
talk about contributions -- I guarantee
you will have a higher chance of landing

25
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,380
the job that you are applying for.

26
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,910
Let's look at some examples of what I
mean. And hopefully this can give you an

27
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:44,500
idea of how you can improve your resume
right after this video. So let's say you

28
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,420
were an interviewer in your past job,
you were in a management position at a

29
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,020
company and on your resume you write:
"interviewed and trained new employees".

30
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,040
That's great. That is a very important
job. But that is probably in the job

31
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,120
description for the new job that you're
applying for. They want someone who

32
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,560
interviews and who trains new employees,
if you are applying for a management

33
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,410
position, for example. But you this will
not make your resume stand out. Almost

34
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:23,230
everybody applying for that type of job
will have done this task. So what makes

35
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,090
you stand out? What is your core
achievement at this past job? Well,

36
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,130
instead of saying that you interviewed
and you trained new employees, you could

37
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:39,610
say that you streamlined employee
onboarding process, and you increased HR

38
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,410
efficiency, you're using a strong verb
like streamlined, which means you made

39
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,510
it like as simple as possible, which
made the administrative Human Resources

40
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,720
process more efficient. So you achieved
something, you got a result before you

41
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:01,210
got there. Maybe the management tasks
were a bit of a mess. So you said no,

42
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,350
no, no, I'm going to make this easier.
So I'm going to make a checklist of

43
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,310
things that I will do with each new
employee, I'm going to make sure that

44
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,110
everyone has the same experience. And
I'm going to make the process more

45
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:19,390
efficient. So "streamlined employee
onboarding process", and "increased HR

46
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:24,970
efficiency" is much more attractive than
"interviewed and trained new employees".

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,500
Let's move on to the next one. So: what
if you negotiated contracts with

48
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,640
vendors? So vendors are business
partners that you work with,

49
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,340
salespeople. Of course, if you're
applying for a job where you have to

50
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,700
deal with vendors, with clients,
business clients, specifically, then you

51
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:53,620
will need to know how to do this task.
But so is everyone else who is

52
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:58,450
submitting their resume. To make your
resume stand out, why don't you write

53
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:07,150
something like this instead: "Slashed
vendor admin costs 20% by negotiating

54
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:13,690
prices and fees". So first you have the
result: what happened? "Slashed vendor

55
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,090
admin costs by 20%" -- you're giving an
exact number of a result, something

56
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,670
tangible, something your potential
future employer can feel. And then

57
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:30,310
you're saying how you did that result.
How did you do that? By negotiating

58
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,310
prices and fees with the vendor. So
you're giving a result, and you're

59
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,060
talking about a contribution that you
made to your past company.

60
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:47,650
Finally: "Provided quality service to
customers". This can be in a store, this

61
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:54,160
can be over the phone. Okay. Now, of
course, this is very general, it's very

62
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,220
bland, it doesn't say much. Okay. Anyone
applying for a customer service

63
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:05,650
position, if they've had a customer
service job in the past, will mention

64
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:11,590
this. Yeah, I provided quality service.
What does that mean? Let's look at a

65
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:18,370
better way to say it. "Regularly
surpassed sales targets, yielding

66
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,910
greater profits for the company." So if
you work in a customer service job, you

67
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:29,920
probably have sales targets, not in all
companies where customer service is a

68
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,680
thing. But in a majority of them or a
large number of them, you have a sales

69
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,470
target. If you mentioned something that
you regularly surpassed, you regularly

70
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,870
achieved and went even above the target
that your boss set for you, that's going

71
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:53,170
to stand out. "Yielding", right, so
creating greater profits for the

72
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:58,870
company. So you're saying, you know
what, because of me, that company made

73
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,690
more money. If you are applying to work
in a business, businesses care about

74
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,450
money. So you want to mention that, you
know, to any potential future employer.

75
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,340
I hope this video has been useful. And
maybe you're thinking now, all of my

76
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:24,190
past job experience on my resume is
task-based. I only talk about like what

77
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,620
I did, not what I accomplished, you can
change that now. And I guarantee that

78
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,860
you'll have a higher chance of landing
the job that you want and that you're

79
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,680
applying for. So remember: focus on
results, focus on contributions, focus

80
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:44,650
on achievements. Don't just talk about
what you did. Talk about what you

81
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:50,200
accomplished. If you want to test your
