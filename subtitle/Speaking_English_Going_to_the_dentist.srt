1
00:00:06,948 --> 00:00:16,928
What's wrong? Yeah, I know. I have a toothache.
It hurts. I have to go to the dentist. What's

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:31,943
a "dentist"? A "dentist" is a tooth doctor. Do
you hate going to the dentist? I love going

3
00:00:31,989 --> 00:00:39,481
to the dentist. I don't know why. Ever since
I was a child, I have absolutely loved going

4
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:47,176
to the dentist. Maybe because my dentist gave
me stickers to play with or something to take

5
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:52,810
home, I don't know. I've just never been afraid
of the dentist. I always thought that it was

6
00:00:52,810 --> 00:01:00,851
really cool to see all the tools that the
dentists use and put them in my mouth. I was

7
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,168
a strange child. Not much has
changed except I've gotten bigger.

8
00:01:05,387 --> 00:01:11,249
My name is Ronnie. Today, I'm going to teach you
about going to the dentist. Oh, the torture.

9
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:19,813
Oh, the pain. Oh, the fear. Oh, the fun. I'm
going to teach you some basic vocabulary that

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,873
you need to know if you go
to the beautiful dentist.

11
00:01:24,247 --> 00:01:35,753
First of all, we have English singular and plural.
So, singular is one "tooth". So you

12
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:46,277
can say, "My tooth hurts", or "I have a toothache"
-- singular, "tooth". So "tooth" means one.

13
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:54,499
If you want to talk about more than one tooth, you
would say "teeth". Now, ladies and gentlemen,

14
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:04,238
boys and girls, please be very careful with
your pronunciation of the word "teeth" and

15
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:15,181
"tooth", especially "teeth". If you do not
stick your tongue out and say "teeth", it

16
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:23,596
sounds like you say "tits", "tits". It sounds
like you say "tits". Don't say that. So: "tooth"

17
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:33,033
and "teeth". You must stick out your tongue to
get the pronunciation of this word correct.

18
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:42,341
The next word you might know already, but thing
this is strange, and think, "Gum? Chewing

19
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:46,988
gum? What? What? What is -- dentist? Chewing?
No, I don't know. I don't get it." "Gums"

20
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:56,772
are basically the pink -- can you get in there?
-- the pink part above your teeth. So if this

21
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:04,324
is a picture of my black teeth, I have a pink
tissue above my mouth -- or in my mouth

22
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:14,439
-- that surrounds my teeth like this, and these are called "gums".
It is always plural. We don't

23
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,438
say "gum". We don't say "my gum", we say "gums".
So in your mouth, hopefully you have teeth.

24
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:28,280
Some of you might not have all of your beautiful
teeth, but that's okay. Don't worry. You have

25
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,920
your teeth, and you have gums.
So "gums" is the pink part here.

26
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:51,488
Sometimes your tooth is sore. So you might say,
"Oh, my tooth is sore. I have a toothache."

27
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:59,329
Say this with me: "Toothache. Toothache. I have
a toothache." That means there's something

28
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:07,659
wrong with your tooth. It's causing you pain.
Uh-oh! Most of the time, the reason why you

29
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:18,237
have a toothache is because you have a cavity -- "cavity".
Now, "cavity" is simply a hole

30
00:04:18,331 --> 00:04:25,410
in your tooth. So this is a beautiful, red,
healthy tooth, and what happens is a cavity

31
00:04:27,503 --> 00:04:36,783
makes a hole in your tooth, and it begins
to rot right down to the root or the vein

32
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:43,930
in your tooth, and that causes you pain. So
a "cavity" basically just means a hole in

33
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:50,374
your tooth. And because this is rotting away,
it causes pain in the nerve in your mouth,

34
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:57,251
causing you to get a toothache: not a
good feeling, not a good situation.

35
00:04:58,243 --> 00:05:09,964
Unfortunately, the dentist is very expensive
in Canada, so I recommend that you brush your

36
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:17,020
teeth at least two times a day -- to help
with the bad breath as well. You may have

37
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:24,705
done a lesson on bad habits, bad breath. We
don't like that. One of the reasons you may

38
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:30,299
have bad breath -- or someone, not
you -- is because you have a cavity.

39
00:05:30,385 --> 00:05:37,680
So what you're going to do is you're going
to call the dentist. You are going to make

40
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:45,734
an appointment. Now, you might have noticed
that I have written n-n-v-v-v-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n;

41
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:51,855
"n" means "noun". So this means it is a noun,
and "v" means "verb". So what's going to happen

42
00:05:51,910 --> 00:06:01,605
is you're going to call the dentist's office,
and you are going to "make an appointment".

43
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:06,819
"Make" is a verb, so you're going to call and
make an appointment. The dentist's receptionist

44
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:16,179
is going to say, "tomorrow at seven." -"No." They
will arrange a time for you. I know sometimes

45
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,959
talking on the telephone is difficult, so if
you can communicate with a dentist through

46
00:06:22,028 --> 00:06:28,948
email, or if you can actually go to a dentist
office, it will be easier for you. But

47
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:35,099
it doesn't matter if you call, email, or go there.
You're going to make an appointment. What's

48
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:41,280
going to happen is the doctor is going to
give you a check-up -- or the dentist, sorry.

49
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,190
The tooth doctor is going to give you a "check-up".
This just means he or she will check your

50
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,889
teeth -- check if they're healthy; make sure
you don't have any cavities; make sure your

51
00:06:51,889 --> 00:07:02,431
gums are okay. They may even give you an X-ray.
That's very expensive too. An "X-ray" is a

52
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:09,080
picture of the bone structure in your mouth.
The X-ray lets the doctor know any additional

53
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,150
things -- cavities you can't see on an X-ray,
but if there's inflammation or something wrong

54
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:19,705
with the inside of your teeth, the
X-ray will show the dentist this.

55
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:30,997
Then it's time for the drill. If you have a
cavity, the dentist is going to take a drill...

56
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:36,902
Now, you may know the word "drill". Let's say
you wanted to hang something in your apartment.

57
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:44,696
You're going to take a screw and a machine --
that doesn't look like a drill, but that's

58
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:53,867
okay. And, basically, a "drill" is going to
make a bigger hole in your tooth. Guess what:

59
00:07:53,905 --> 00:07:59,159
This really, really, really hurts. So it's
like taking a hammer or an electrical thing

60
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:07,189
and going "aah" and drilling your tooth. They
usual give you some kind of help. They usually

61
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:11,629
give you some kind of drugs or medicine so
you don't feel the drill going in. So what

62
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:16,789
happens is they take their beautiful dentist
drill; they drill a hole; and they drill all

63
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:22,795
the bad stuff out of your cavity. Then
they take what's called a "filling".

64
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:33,268
I forgot to write this down. A "filling" basically
fills your cavity with usually a white or

65
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:45,053
sometimes silver -- gold if you're really,
really, really rich -- compound and it stops

66
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:50,279
the hole or it stops the cavity from growing.
So they drill, and then they fill or they

67
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:56,095
put in a filling to cover your tooth. The
next thing that they're going to do is

68
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:03,010
they're going to have to put a cap on your
tooth so that food or foreign objects, like

69
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:12,005
an airplane, doesn't go back into your tooth.
So a "cap" is basically like a lid or a hat.

70
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:18,917
It's a tooth hat. It's a hat for your tooth
to protect it from all the drilling. So a

71
00:09:18,956 --> 00:09:25,990
"cap" is what happens at the end after the drilling.
After the filling, you get a beautiful

72
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,709
cap. Maybe -- when you
go for your check-up or

73
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:36,920
your appointment -- you don't have a cavity.
Yay! What they will do is they will clean

74
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:44,397
your teeth. They usually use a fluoride solution,
and they scrape all the dirty stuff off your

75
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:56,604
teeth. This is called "tartar". Oh, not "tarnar".
Excuse me. So this is called "tartar", and

76
00:09:56,655 --> 00:10:03,850
it's basically a build-up of dirty, dirty,
dirty stuff on your teeth. So they scrape

77
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:12,705
it so your teeth are nice and clean. Maybe
there is no help for your tooth. Maybe

78
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,883
the cavity has eaten all of your tooth, and
your teeth -- tooth needs to be taken out.

79
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:27,730
What happens in this case is you have two options.
You can get an implant. Do you know

80
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:34,450
another place you can get implants? An "implant"
means a -- basically, a fake tooth. So they

81
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:42,141
put another drill in your mouth, and they're
going to put, like, a nail or a screw, and

82
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:48,651
they just put a fake tooth, and they screw it
into your mouth. It looks real. It's wonderful.

83
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:54,589
Not -- did I forget to mention that the doctor
is very, very, very expensive and painful?

84
00:10:55,381 --> 00:11:04,730
Or the other option you could go with is a
false tooth, or plural, false teeth. A lot

85
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:10,347
of older ladies and gentlemen have false teeth.
You can take them out -- scare the grandkids.

86
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:17,709
So you have options. If you have money, you
can have beautiful new teeth. No one will

87
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:27,007
ever know you had a cavity. Go to YouTube.
