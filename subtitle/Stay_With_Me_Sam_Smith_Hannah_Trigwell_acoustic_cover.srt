1
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,200
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand

2
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,480
But I still need love 'cause I'm just human

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,380
These nights never seem to go to plan

4
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,900
I don't want you to leave, 
will you hold my hand?

5
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,040
Oh, won't you stay with me?

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,520
'Cause you're all I need

7
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:10,600
This ain't love it's clear to see

8
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,040
But darling, stay with me

9
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,780
Why am I so emotional?

10
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,820
No it's not a good look, gain some self control

11
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,740
Deep down I know this never works

12
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:42,360
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

13
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,140
Oh, won't you stay with me?

14
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,560
'Cause you're all I need

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,840
This ain't love it's clear to see

16
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,080
But darling, stay with me

17
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:13,600
Oh...

18
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,560
Oh, won't you stay...?
Oh, won't you stay...?

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,560
Oh, won't you stay with me?

20
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:33,320
'Cause you're all I need

21
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,160
This ain't love it's clear to see

22
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,620
But darling, stay with me

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,080
Stay with me

24
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,040
Stay with me

25
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,060
Stay with me

26
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:15,160
Won't you stay with me?
