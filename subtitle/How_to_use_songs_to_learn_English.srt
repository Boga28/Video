00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,680
hello my name is emma and i am very excited today 
because i am going to teach you how you can make  

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:16,160
grammar fun that's right grammar can be fun 
you might not believe me um because i know  

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:24,000
grammar english grammar specifically makes a lot 
of students feel like this okay a lot of students  

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,200
when they learn english grammar like the present 
perfect um the past continuous the future simple  

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:38,000
they feel very stressed and they feel very bad 
because grammar can sometimes be boring and it  

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,200
can sometimes be difficult okay so if this is how 
you feel about grammar if you find it really hard  

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,880
or maybe you love grammar but you want to find 
another way to learn grammar this video is for  

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:01:00,080
you so my tip today is that one of the best ways 
to learn grammar is by using songs and music  

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,280
and why is this well i want you to think when you 
listen to music a lot of the times you probably  

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:15,360
feel like this music makes people feel very happy 
so while grammar might make you feel bored or  

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,880
you might find it difficult music can make you 
feel happy so by combining or putting together  

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:32,960
music and grammar you can have a fun learning 
experience okay so let me first talk about why  

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,160
it's good to use music when you're learning 
grammar and then i'm going to talk about how  

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,320
you can use music to learn grammar and some of my 
favorite songs you can use you can use to do this  

15
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,960
okay so let's get started so when we use a song 
songs have a lot of great grammar points in them  

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,920
okay if you've ever heard the bare naked ladies 
they have a great song that we're talking about  

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,600
we'll talk a little bit about later called if i 
had a million dollars this song is wonderful for  

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,600
learning the second conditional okay we have songs 
that are great for learning the present perfect  

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,520
songs that are great for learning the past 
tense and i'm going to talk about these songs  

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,120
and how you can use them but if you think about it 
why can these songs really help you learn grammar  

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:30,560
well first of all when you use music okay and you 
sing a song when you sing you're actually using a  

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,120
different part of your brain than you do when you 
speak and by using a different part of your brain  

23
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,960
it can actually help you remember things such as 
grammar or such as different words in the song  

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,320
so using singing can help you remember 
if you think about stress a lot of the  

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,920
times when you're in english class and 
learning grammar you might feel stressed  

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,280
stress is bad for learning music can help 
you feel less stress so it can lower stress  

27
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,160
and by doing this music can actually increase 
learning it can make learning go up okay you can  

28
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,040
learn a lot more when you're not stressed music 
has a lot of repetition if you think about songs  

29
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,880
you often hear the same lyrics again and again 
in the chorus this repetition is good for memory  

30
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,640
there are a lot of fun activities you can do when 
you're using music and you can learn a lot about a  

31
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,680
person's culture from the music okay so i'm going 
to share a little bit of canadian culture with you  

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,720
today when i talk about some canadian bands you 
can use when you're learning grammar and finally  

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,560
i have a lot of favorite songs i love to use with 
my classes for grammar so i'm going to share these  

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,640
with you so these are some of the reasons why 
music can be so helpful with learning grammar now  

35
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,640
let's learn how we can use music okay so the first 
step is thinking about what kind of grammar do  

36
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,840
you want to practice okay so maybe in your english 
class you're learning about the second conditional  

37
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,840
maybe um you you're not in english class but 
you just want to learn grammar on your own  

38
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,680
and that's okay too um so i'm just going to give 
you some examples and there's many other examples  

39
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,480
but some examples of songs you can use when you're 
learning these different points of grammar okay  

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,840
so the first example i'm going to give is if 
you're learning what we call the simple present  

41
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:38,560
okay so that's sentences like i run i eat you 
know i eat a hamburger i um read a book these  

42
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,120
are all examples of the simple present tense 
and so that has to do with what's happening now  

43
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,920
so two great songs for practicing the simple 
present tense the first one is a really sad song  

44
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:59,200
by marian faithful and it's called as tears go by 
okay so what you can do is if you want to practice  

45
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,800
using any of these songs you can go on youtube 
and listen to them and just type in as tiers go by  

46
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,240
you can also check out jules song you were 
meant for me this is another great song you  

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:24,000
can use when practicing um grammar from the simple 
present tense okay in terms of simple past tense  

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:34,560
so simple past is when you have an ed ending 
so for example i looked at the store i bought  

49
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:44,240
some ice cream yesterday i did my homework these 
are all examples of the simple past tense okay so  

50
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,400
sometimes we have regular simple past which is ed 
endings and sometimes we have irregular endings  

51
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,360
now if this is confusing to you that's okay the 
main point is if you're talking about the past  

52
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,160
you can listen to these songs for grammar points 
we have yesterday by the beatles which is a great  

53
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,960
song when you're learning about the past tense 
because the beatles tend to sing very slow so you  

54
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,920
can really hear the words and you can really hear 
the grammar in this song and it's about yesterday  

55
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,760
so you know it's about the past there's also 
another song by andy williams called yesterday  

56
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,240
when i was young or at least andy williams sings 
it there's different versions but yesterday when  

57
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,000
i was young is another great song when you're 
looking at the past tense if you're looking  

58
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,600
at the past continuous sense tense sorry um last 
kiss by pearl jam is a wonderful song for this one  

59
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,400
in terms of the simple future so this is when we 
use the word will and we talk about the future  

60
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,400
you can use the shirelle's or amy winehouse 
will you still love me tomorrow that's an  

61
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,960
excellent song for this tense or if you like 
the beatles you can also use when i'm 64  

62
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,520
where they talk about what they're going 
to do in the future when they're 64.  

63
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,120
if you like um you know maybe other types of 
music the proclaimers has a great song called  

64
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,600
i will walk 500 miles so you can check that 
song out too that has a lot of this tense in it  

65
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,840
for students looking to learn more about the 
present perfect and this is always a really  

66
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:35,920
challenging tense for students this is when we say 
things like have you ever i have never um i have  

67
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:44,400
eaten an apple before okay so this tense is really 
challenging some great songs for it are have you  

68
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,720
ever seen the rain okay so um there's different 
versions of this song you can listen to the one  

69
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,760
from rod stewart or any other musician who sings 
this but have you ever seen the rain is great for  

70
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:04,160
this uh tense you can also check out youtube's 
i still haven't found what i'm looking for  

71
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,480
this is another great song for the present 
perfect if you're learning the second conditional  

72
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,600
i'm going to talk about a song to help you 
with that in a moment but some other songs  

73
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:24,720
are if i were a boy by beyonce if i fell in love 
by the beatles and finally if you're learning  

74
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,200
should have like you know something that you 
regret you can use bruno mars i should have  

75
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,880
bought you flowers okay so these are just some 
examples of great songs you can use to help you  

76
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,640
learn english grammar now i'm going to show you 
how you can use a specific song to kind of get  

77
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,120
an idea of activities you can do okay so um a song 
that i really like using when teaching the second  

78
00:08:51,120 --> 00:09:00,160
conditional and the second conditional is if i had 
a million dollars i'd be rich that's an example  

79
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:07,440
so a song i really like using for teaching the 
second conditional is a song by a canadian band  

80
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,400
and i'm canadian so i like canadian bands and 
this canadian band is called the bear naked ladies  

81
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:23,200
okay so the song they sing is called if i 
had a million dollars okay you can youtube it  

82
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,000
and find the song um and you know listen to it 
and in the comments you can tell me what you  

83
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,560
think of the song okay some students love it some 
students maybe they're not as big of a fan of it  

84
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,040
but it's a great song for learning the second 
conditional okay so how can you use this song  

85
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,840
um if you want to learn grammar well let's 
look at some ideas for activities you can do  

86
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,800
so the first thing i would suggest is just listen 
to the song listen to it a couple of times and you  

87
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,160
know think about the song listen for the grammar 
is there anything you can hear about the second  

88
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,720
conditional maybe before listening to the song 
you can even look up what the second conditional  

89
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,960
is if you don't know that grammar yet 
okay and then you can just listen to it  

90
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,880
the next thing you can do is look for the 
lyrics you can google the lyrics of the song  

91
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,640
or find them on youtube and try to find examples 
of the grammar so in this case you can look for  

92
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,120
examples of the second conditional so i've just 
written out some lyrics from the song here there's  

93
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,000
a lot of examples of the second conditional in the 
song but for example if i had a million dollars  

94
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:49,200
i'd buy you a house if i had a million dollars i'd 
buy furniture for your house like a chesterfield  

95
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,400
or an ottoman so these are lyrics from the song 
and so i'd look at them and i try to think okay  

96
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:02,720
where is the second conditional in this song 
well when we talk about the second conditional  

97
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:11,360
we're talking about a sentence that has the 
word if in it okay so just looking oh here's if  

98
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:22,800
here's if okay so two examples it also has wood 
in it um or the contraction of wood which is  

99
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,480
in this case i would becomes eyed so this is 
an example of part of the second conditional  

100
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:36,560
okay and then i can look at um you know what 
goes with if what tense so in this case if i  

101
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:48,240
had a million dollars i'd buy you a house if i had 
a million dollars i'd buy furniture for your house  

102
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,480
so look for the grammar look for examples of it 
and if this is hard for you maybe it's because  

103
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,840
you haven't learned the second conditional yet 
so i recommend studying the second conditional  

104
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:07,120
first and then using this as a guide so after 
you find examples of the grammatical tense  

105
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,800
you want to study then you can think about why 
are they using this tense okay why are they  

106
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,440
using the second conditional here what does 
it mean in this case when you see if i had  

107
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,760
and i'd buy what they're saying using the second 
conditional is they're talking about uh imaginary  

108
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:34,960
situation so something that's not true the singer 
does not have a million dollars but he's imagining  

109
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,040
what would life be like if i did have a mat or if 
i did have a million dollars and what would i do  

110
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,920
okay so we use the second conditional 
to talk about an imaginary situation  

111
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,480
something that's not true but we want to imagine 
what we would do if it was true so in this case  

112
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,920
this person if they had a million dollars 
they do not have a million dollars but if  

113
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:05,840
they did they would buy you a house okay and if 
they had a million dollars they would also buy  

114
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,560
furniture for your house so they're using this 
to show they don't have a million but if they  

115
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,800
did this is what they would do the next thing you 
can do after you think about why they use this  

116
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,480
tents is you can actually sing the song okay so 
you can find a copy of the lyrics and sing along  

117
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,240
okay sing it until you remember the words and then 
after you do that you can test yourself okay cover  

118
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,520
up some words in the song so for example when i 
sing it if i and i cover this up so i can't read  

119
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,520
it i have to try to remember what was the word 
they used there what verb tense was it in okay  

120
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:53,520
if i oh okay if i had so you can test yourself 
and practice singing the song by covering up  

121
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,440
the verbs and seeing if you can remember um 
the verbs they use and the tenses they use  

122
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,560
okay um the final thing you can do as a fun 
activity is you can actually make your own lyrics  

123
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,560
with the grammar you're interested in so 
if you're practicing the second conditional  

124
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,880
you can change this if i had a million 
dollars maybe you can change it to if i had a

125
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:32,160
dog okay if i had a dog i'd what's something i 
can say about if i had a dog maybe i'd walk it

126
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,920
so you can change the lyrics to maybe something 
that you might say in everyday life and this can  

127
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,320
help you practice using the second conditional so 
change the lyrics and sing your own lyrics to the  

128
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,600
song and see how that goes okay so these are just 
some ways you can use music when learning grammar  

129
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,640
and there's many other ways to use it these are 
just some suggestions i hope you check out the  

130
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:04,560
songs i recommended today and i also hope that
