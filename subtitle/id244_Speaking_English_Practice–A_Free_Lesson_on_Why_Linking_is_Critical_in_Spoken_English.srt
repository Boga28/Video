00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,303
In today's lesson we're going to study a scene from a movie 

2
00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:06,434
and you're going to learn so much about pronunciation.  

3
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:09,745
We're really going to focus on
smoothness in American English, 

4
00:00:09,745 --> 00:00:15,844
especially vowel to vowel links and how using these same kind  

5
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:19,647
of links and smoothness in your own speech will help you sound 

6
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:25,200
so natural and American. 
Linking two words with a single sound.  

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,464
Also the way we drop syllables in American English 

8
00:00:28,464 --> 00:00:32,855
like how families becomes fam-lies, two syllables.  

9
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:35,753
There's so much to learn about 
smoothness 

10
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,600
and linking in American English.  

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,292
You're going to get perfect pronunciation on some common two-word

12
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:48,763
phrases like ‘used to’ becoming ‘used tə’ and wanted a becoming ‘wɔntɪd ə’. 

13
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:54,189
So stick with me, I am so excited for you to learn these tips and tricks about 

14
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:58,640
American English pronunciation. 
First here's the scene we'll study. 

15
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,057
Lola said you asked about her potato mashers.

16
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:07,100
Your kid is super dope. And I was thinking I used to help out families 

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,520
in my neighborhood, like if 
parents wanted a night out,  

18
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,360
I would stay with their kids or like even 
watch their house, and I was wondering if  

19
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,200
like you and Lola have a situation like 
that with someone who I need to kill. 

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,691
No.

21
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,200
Let's do the analysis. 

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,550
Lola said you asked about her potato mashers. 

23
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,303
An interesting first sentence let's look at our stressed words. 

24
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:39,200
The name, the proper noun Lola, Lola. 
That's got that up down shape of stress,  

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,405
Lola. That smooth gliding in American English, we don't really have jumps

26
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:49,994
or skips for the most part. It's generally smooth gliding from 

27
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:54,880
sound to sound, syllable to syllable, 
word to word. 

28
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,800
Lola said yes.
you asked about her potato mashers. 

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,080
Lola said you asked about. A little bit 
of that up down pitch change on asked,  

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:17,720
our verb. Lola said you asked about 
her potato mashers. So all of those  

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,749
words gliding together smoothly with no breaks.

32
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:31,160
Lola said you asked about her potato mashers. 

33
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,258
So, the word Lola, this name ends in the schwa sound 

34
00:02:34,258 --> 00:02:37,813
and the schwa goes right into the S of said. 

35
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:42,520
So, if you want to practice linking, 
you could say ‘ə said, ə said’. So you can  

36
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,517
link that ending schwa into the word said with no break as if it was the same word. 

37
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:54,000
ə said, ə said. Lola said, ə said, Lola said.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,206

The Top Three Ways to Master the American accent. 

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,000
Lola said--

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
Lola said you asked about her potato mashers. 

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,913
Said you asked about her, said you asked about her. 

44
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:23,304
These are all a little bit lower in volume
 and energy than Lola, potato. 

45
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:26,360
Lola said you asked about her, 
said you asked about her. 

46
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,760
It's a little quieter and it's very fast, isn't it? 
Very fast. Said you asked about her,  

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,272
said you asked about her.

48
00:03:33,272 --> 00:03:37,384
Said you asked about her— 

49
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:40,351
Said you asked about her. There are a couple different ways that we may

50
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,581
 pronounce D plus the word you. 

51
00:03:42,581 --> 00:03:46,600
Said-ju, it's very common to 
make a J sound, I don't really hear that,  

52
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,801
said you said. The D is vibrating in the vocal cords and then it goes right into 

53
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:59,039
the U diphthong for the word you. Said you, said you, said you,  

54
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,800
said you, said you, said you, said you asked. 

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:09,840
Now we have an U vowel or the second half of the U diphthong linking into 
another vowel.  

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:19,600
ae as in asked. The ED ending here makes a T, 

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,583
and linking vowel to vowel is sometimes 
the hardest one to do smoothly.

58
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:33,920
 You-asked. So, in this case it can help 
you to feel like you're going through  

59
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,465
a W consonant which is a glide consonant, that can help you connect these smoothly.

60
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:43,465
You asked,  you asked, you asked.

61
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:46,520
You asked— 

62
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,240
This lesson was recently released in 
my Academy with audio to train with,  

63
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,981
you will hear me reference training with that material in this video.

64
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:58,989
Watching the analysis video and then training with the soundboard, 

65
00:04:58,989 --> 00:05:04,470
speaking out loud in slow motion to help you hear the up down shape of stress.

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,040
I'm just so tired. 

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,541
Then at regular pace over and over—

68
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:14,040
I'm just so tired. 

69
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,720
Can really help you smooth out your speech simplify your mouth movements

70
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,000
and get a more relaxed and natural a American placement in sound.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,068
If you feel you could benefit from more ease in speaking American English, 

72
00:05:29,068 --> 00:05:31,649
please check out  Rachelsenglishacademy.com.

73
00:05:31,649 --> 00:05:35,308
We have a great training program that's helped thousands of students 

74
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:41,334
improve their American accent and speak with less effort and more confidence. 

75
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:46,243
Now, you may notice she's not saying asked. She's saying asked.   

76
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:51,400
What is happening? This many consonants in a row especially unvoiced  

77
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,568
can be tricky so it's pretty common to drop the middle one,  

78
00:05:56,568 --> 00:06:00,332
and then you get asked, asked, asked instead of asked, asked, asked.

79
00:06:00,332 --> 00:06:06,240
It really simplifies it. You asked, you asked, you asked. 

80
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:14,082
So that W to connect, low and volume in pitch, very smooth and dropping that K. 
You asked. 

81
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,183
You asked—

82
00:06:17,183 --> 00:06:18,840
about her potato mashers. 

83
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,446
Her potato masher, about her potato masher. About her. Asked about. 

84
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:30,998
So, the ending T of asked links into the beginning sound the schwa of about asked ə, 

85
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:36,186
asked ə, asked about, asked about, this T is pronounced as a stop T, 

86
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:43,449
about her, about her, about her, about her. So that little tiny lift there, that little lift in 

87
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:49,252
energy, is what signifies the stop T. Another way to pronounce these two words, 

88
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:54,745
about her, about her, that would be a flap T 
no H, that's another common pronunciation. 

89
00:06:54,745 --> 00:07:00,556
In fact, it's maybe even more common    than stop T with it H. 

90
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:03,274
About her, about [flap]. 

91
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:08,234
Do you hear that flap? About her. But here
 it's about her, about her, about her. 

92
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:12,600
About her—
potato mashers. 

93
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:21,573
Potato mashers. Potato. So, a lot more pitch change here than we had in this 
little one for asked. 

94
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:29,280
Pota, ey. Don't be afraid to hit 
more extreme up and downs as you're practicing  

95
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,903
your English. This may be exactly what your English needs. 

96
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:38,214
Pota-to. So notice we have two different T's here.  

97
00:07:38,214 --> 00:07:43,560
This first one is a true T, that's because 
it starts a stressed syllable,  

98
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:51,920
starts a stressed syllable. And the second one is a flap T, potato. 
Also we have two letters O,  

99
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,200
but two different pronunciations. The 
first one is a schwa, pə, pə, and the  

100
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:08,120
second one is an O diphthong. Ou, ou. Ou-t-r. So, the letters don't always make the 
same sounds.  

101
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,473
This word is good for noticing that. Two letters O but two different pronunciations. 

102
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:16,400
Two letters T,  

103
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,501
but two different pronunciations.

104
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,101
Potato-- 

105
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,645
Potato mashers.
 

106
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:28,360
Potato mashers. Her voice is very soft. mashers 

107
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:39,937
this is the a vowel. Mashers. First syllable 
stress, a little bit of that up down shape. 

108
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:44,680
Mashers.
Your kid is— 

109
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,048
Your kid is. Your kid is. And then a break. 

110
00:08:51,048 --> 00:08:55,697
So he's not linking everything together quite the same way she is. 

111
00:08:55,697 --> 00:09:01,760
He's putting more stress into this sentence. 
He wants it to be really

112
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:11,400
known to her that he means it. Your kid is. 
Your kid is. The D and kid links right into  

113
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,392
the next word. The T continues right into the K, no breaks here. 

114
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:20,504
No breaks until the end of is. Your kid is.

115
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:25,320
Your kid is— 

116
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:32,134
I love how we can really hear that D  linking into the ih vowel. Kid is [flap], kid is. 

117
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:37,040
kid is—
super dope. 

118
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,972
And the ending S of the word is a Z sound. Now, if he had linked these together, 

119
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:48,433
Z linking into S, that's usually going to turn the Z into an S.

120
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:56,557
But he put a break here, so we have a Z and then an S. Super-dope.

121
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:02,387
super dope. 

122
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:08,440
Super dope. So we have a stressed 
syllable then unstressed. Super. So,  

123
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:15,480
the unstressed syllable is this.
Quiet. Not much to it. The stress  

124
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,360
syllable is su. Louder, up-down shape of 
stress. We need this contrast. Su, super,  

125
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:31,400
super dope. Uhhuh, super dope.
Super dope. 

126
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,338
The letter U makes the U vowel here, super. 

127
00:10:36,338 --> 00:10:40,520
And the letter O makes the OH diphthong, dope,  

128
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,534
just like the ending sound of potato, oh, oh.

129
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:49,392
super dope. 

130
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:55,120
and I was thinking—
And, a little break, breaking  

131
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,248
up his thought groups. I was thinking. Again, no linking there, so ‘and’ 

132
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:08,427
doesn't link in. And, the pitch going up at the end shows that he's going to continue 

133
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:13,792
with his thought. And. Now, the word and if you look that up in the dictionary  

134
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:20,600
you'll see ae. You'll see ae as in bat, 
N and D. But this ae,  

135
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:30,442
it's not pure when it's followed by N. So it's 
not A, that's like cat. A, and. But it's ænd,  

136
00:11:30,442 --> 00:11:43,960
ænd, or in this case, ænd, ænd. So see if you can 
imitate that A, it's more relaxed and it goes into  

137
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:56,640
sort of, you could think of it as the UH as in 
butter or the schwa sound, ænd before the N, ænd. 

138
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,000
And—
I was thinking. 

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,400
I was thinking. What do you notice 
about the intonation, the melody there? 

140
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:15,748
I was thinking. Again it goes up a little bit at the end to show he's not done,

141
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:23,310
he's about to say what he was thinking. Was is unstressed, I and think both 

142
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:28,952
 stressed with that up down shape and the whole thing links together really smoothly.

143
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:34,680
I was thinking— 

144
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,360
The word ‘was’, you can think 
of that wəz, wəz. It's fast,  

145
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,372
it's unstressed. The vowel UH reduces to the schwa. wəz, wəz, I was, I was. 

146
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:59,050
So I is clear, was is unclear. I was, I was, I was. Now I know this transition

147
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:02,160
from Z into TH can be tricky. 

148
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,734
I was—

149
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:06,720
I was thinking. 

150
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:15,440
Was thinking. So this TH is unvoiced, that means the tongue tip has to come 
through the teeth.  

151
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:24,920
For the word was, I wəz. My teeth are more or less together and the back of the 
tongue tip is  

152
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,125
touching the very backs of the teeth. So, inside the mouth here, the tongue tip,
 

153
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:36,000
and outside the mouth here. But it's a little movement. It's not sticking way, 

154
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:46,172
way far out for this. It's just the very tip and the air should flow freely there.

155
00:13:46,172 --> 00:13:54,335
You might want to slowly go back and forth really thinking about both 

156
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:59,400
positions and just notice what change is 
happening in the tongue. 

157
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:10,657
Z. It's not that big of a change. It moves 
up and out of the teeth just a little bit. 

158
00:14:10,657 --> 00:14:16,454
I was thinking—

159
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:19,240
I used to help out families in my neighborhood, 

160
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,718
I used to help out families in my neighborhood. Okay, so what are our stress 
words here? 

161
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:33,960
We have I, and this time rather than going down or up and down it's sort of going 
down and up. I used  

162
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:43,480
to help out families in my neighborhood. So, 
all of those stress syllables are going down  

163
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,691
and up because again he's going to continue on with his thoughts.

164
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:52,466
So we have this upward aiming pitch. I used to help out families.  

165
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:56,337
And again all this links together pretty smoothly. 

166
00:14:56,337 --> 00:15:05,642
No abrupt stop or skips in the melody. It all glides.

167
00:15:05,642 --> 00:15:13,634
I used to help out families in my neighborhood, 

168
00:15:13,634 --> 00:15:28,946
I-U, I-U. So, smoothly linking together those two diphthongs. The I diphthong, 
I-U. I-U, I-U, I-U. 

169
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:32,680
I used—
to help out. 

170
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:40,240
I used to help out. When we have 
used, which is the U vowel Z-D,  

171
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,240
and it's followed by the word to, this 
happens a lot, this is a common phrase,  

172
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,000
something happens.

173
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,880
I used to help out— 

174
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:59,840
The pronunciation changes. So the Z 
changes to an S, the D gets dropped  

175
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:06,640
and the S links into the T and usually this vowel reduces like it does here. Instead of to it's tə. 

176
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:15,360
So, used to is almost always pronounced. 
Used to, used to. You know what, I realized,  

177
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,280
I’ve said U vowel, I meant U diphthong, let 
me rewrite that down there. U, I-U. I used to,  

178
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:28,640
I used to, I used to, I used to. You say it enough times it stops sounding like 
three words, right? 

179
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,600
If you feels like one word. That's what we 
want, that smooth connection. I used to,  

180
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,592
I used to, I used to.

181
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:38,840
I used to— 

182
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,888
help out families.

183
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:45,303
I used to help out families. So, a little bit of up down shape on helping out.  

184
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:52,729
Help. Out. This is a phrasal verb. Two parts to it. Help and out. 

185
00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:58,200
Help out, help out. The P releases into the 
O diphthong, so it's not help out but it's 

186
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:04,480
help out. You can think of the p is 
connecting in help out, help out, help out. 

187
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,829
There shouldn't be a stop there. Now, here there's a little stop because of the stop T. 

188
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:15,960
Why? When the next word begins with a consonant, usually a t in this case is 
pronounced as a stop T.  

189
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:22,094
So, it's not help out, but it's help out, out. It's not dropped. Out, out. 

190
00:17:22,094 --> 00:17:29,029
It's this abrupt stop that signals. It's this abrupt stop that signals the T. 

191
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:33,440
Help out families. Help out families. 

192
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,334
Help out families—

193
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:45,060
Families, families, families. Now, you might notice this looks like it should be fa-mi-les.

194
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,800
Family. Three syllables.  

195
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:54,520
It's much more common to pronounce it as two syllables and that's what he's doing. 
Fam-lies,  

196
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,960
lies. This ending s is a Z. Families, families. So don't make that three syllables. 
Simplify it. 

197
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,625
Families—

198
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,880
in my neighborhood. 

199
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,393
In my neighborhood, in my neighborhood. In my, said so quickly. 

200
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:14,993
In my, in my, in my, in my, in my, in my, in my, in my. How quickly can you 

201
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:20,726
say those two words linking them together? In my, in my, in my, in my, in my. 

202
00:18:20,726 --> 00:18:25,520
This contrast of very, very short words and 
syllables and longer  

203
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,508
syllables is important for clarity.

204
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:33,034
In my neighborhood— 

205
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:40,731
In my neighborhood, in my neigh, stressed syllable, neighborhood, borhood, borhood, 

206
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:46,640
borhood. Last two syllables not stressed, the pitch is just going up, from this  

207
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:56,707
dip for the stress. Borhood, borhood, borhood, borhood. This letter O is the 
schwa, neighborhood. 

208
00:18:56,707 --> 00:19:01,634
In my neighborhood—

209
00:19:01,634 --> 00:19:05,659
In my neighborhood,  in my neighborhood. It's really fast. 

210
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:09,040
Neigh is the only syllable that has some length. 

211
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:14,534
In my neighborhood—
Like— 

212
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:24,000
Like, like. Filler word said pretty flatly 
here. Little bit of up down shape. Like, like, like.

213
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,400
like, 

214
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,920
And he does release the K, 
kk, kk, we hear that sound. 

215
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,194
Like,

216
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:38,194
if parents wanted a night out. 

217
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:46,240
If parents wanted a night out. If 
parents, if parents wanted a. So,  

218
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:54,440
we have up down shape of stress there. Wanted a night out. And then also on the 
word night out,  

219
00:19:54,440 --> 00:20:03,720
the phrase night out. Night out and again he makes 
his pitch go up and down. Sorry, down then up,  

220
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,880
so he can continue his thought. He signals with that intonation that he's going to keep 
going. 

221
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,593
The word if said so fast. Up here we're talking about how ‘in my’ is so fast, 

222
00:20:16,593 --> 00:20:24,360
the word if, honestly all I really hear is the F consonant. F, parents, f, f, f, f parents, 
F parents, f parents, 

223
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,078
if parents—
 

224
00:20:27,078 --> 00:20:27,880
wanted a—

225
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:36,320
If parents wanted a, wanted a, wanted a, wanted a. What do you notice about this T
 and wanted? 

226
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,760
It gets dropped, doesn't it? Wanted a, wanted a, wanted a. There are a couple 
different vowels  

227
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:49,520
you can give this. AH and father, AH and law, UH and butters also pretty common 
though you  

228
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,451
might not see that in the dictionary. Wanted a, I think I tend to use this one the most. 

229
00:20:56,451 --> 00:21:05,212
If parents want a. So here, the ED ending we studied before a case where the ED 

230
00:21:05,212 --> 00:21:10,639
ending was a T and the word ‘asked’. Here the ED ending is an extra syllable, 

231
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:14,000
so it's a vowel sound and a consonant sound. Id,  

232
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,800
id, wanid, wanid a, and then that D links 
right into the schwa, for a, wanted a,  

233
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,400
wanted a, wanted a, wanted a, wanted a. Just like used to, used to, used to, used to,  

234
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:33,508
up here. There a lot of cases where it's a super common two-word phrase 

235
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:40,581
or three-word phrase and it gets reduced and simplified. 

236
00:21:40,581 --> 00:21:44,916
If parents wanted a-- 

237
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:45,941
night out,

238
00:21:45,941 --> 00:21:52,334
Let's look at the two-word phrase night out. Two T's at the end, how are they pronounced?  

239
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:56,334
Night out, 

240
00:21:56,334 --> 00:22:02,320
Night out, night out [flap],  

241
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,040
that's a flap T. To me it sounds like 
a D, depending on your native language,  

242
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:12,520
it might sound like an R, but that's the flap 
T. And we use the flap T to link words between  

243
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:20,320
vowel or diphthong sounds. So the word night in IPA would be written N consonant, I diphthong,  

244
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:32,680
night, and then the word out is with the AU 
diphthong. Out. So here's a diphthong, here's  

245
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:44,000
a diphthong. The T between is a flap. Night out. Now, the ending T here, he does do a true T release.

246
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,640
He could have even linked it in, night out I, 
night out I. But he separates it. Night  

247
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,267
out, Night out. 

248
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:56,960
Night out, 

249
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,460
I would—

250
00:22:57,468 --> 00:23:07,176
I would, I would. Little break. He's breaking this up quite a bit. I would, 

251
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:14,325
I would. One word is stressed. It's I. The next word not stressed. It just smoothly 

252
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:24,560
falls down from the peak of stress for I. 
I would. Would, would. Simple. I would. 

253
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,040
I would—
stay with their kids. 

254
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,880
Stay with her kids, stay with their kids. So 
‘stay with’ there said quickly and it's pretty  

255
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:42,360
flat in pitch. Stay with their kids. Now he's 
listing things. Things that he would do. So when  

256
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:49,600
we list things, everything goes up in intonation at the end until the last part of the list. So,  

257
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,000
stay with her kids, stay with their, stay with 
their, stay with their, stay with their. That's  

258
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,158
all sort of that unstressed, less clear feeling, isn't it? And it all links together. 

259
00:24:00,158 --> 00:24:06,000
Here we have two different th's, we can link those together with a single unvoiced TH, 

260
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,415
with there, with there, with their, with their, with their, with their, with their, 

261
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,468
stay with their, stay with their, stay with their kids.

262
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:18,320
Stay with their kids— 

263
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,240
or like,
The word ‘or’, he reduces it.  

264
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:32,458
schwa R said so fast, linked into the word ‘like’. This is all really flat. And it's lower in 

265
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:37,640
volume,  lower in pitch. It's again a little bit of a filler word. Or like, or like, or like,  

266
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:44,440
or like, or like, or like. See if you can get that same low open quality. Or like, or like, or like. 

267
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,229
Or like,

268
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:48,034
or like even watch their house. 

269
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:59,436
Even watch their house. So, again he's still 
listing things. Even watch their house.  

270
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:05,377
So, it's still going up, he's not done with 
his thought on what he's going to offer. 

271
00:25:05,377 --> 00:25:09,434
Now, let's look at this word ‘even’. It's not stressed.

272
00:25:09,434 --> 00:25:17,400
even watch— 

273
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,560
I basically don't even hear very much 
of the word. I sort of hear the E vowel,  

274
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,773
I sort of hear the N consonant but it's 
really reduced. It's not said very clearly.  

275
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:34,373
It's crazy but in American English, we simply don't say every single word clearly. 

276
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:39,635
We say some less clear and that provides contrast to the more clear and we  

277
00:25:39,635 --> 00:25:45,634
like having those two different kinds. That's what makes it clear. Even watch. 

278
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:48,400
Even watch— 

279
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:54,245
Even watch their house.
Watch their house. So the word there like 

280
00:25:54,245 --> 00:26:00,800
even, it's unstressed. It doesn't have an up 
down melody or down up ,it's just kind  

281
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:07,734
of flat in this case it's connecting these two, and it's not pronounced there but it's their. 

282
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:12,834
watch their house.

283
00:26:12,834 --> 00:26:18,633
Their house, their house. So fast, there, there, there, there, there. 

284
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:23,203
I don't even need to bring my tongue tip through the teeth for that TH, there, 

285
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:28,520
there, there. I just touch it on the backs 
of the teeth. Their, their, their. That  

286
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,701
way I can make the word super, super short. So, it's not their, it's their, their. 

287
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:38,884
their house.

288
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:43,624
It kind of stops sounding like the word, doesn't it? Their, their. Sometimes when you

289
00:26:43,624 --> 00:26:48,662
isolate these unstressed words by themselves, it sounds like it can't possibly 

290
00:26:48,662 --> 00:26:51,720
be the right pronunciation because it's so unclear, and yet  

291
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,534
it is. Their, their, their house.

292
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:58,921
their house. 

293
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:02,560
And—
And. Little bit of a break there, full  

294
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,880
pronunciation and it's really common to reduce that but since he's breaking it out into its own  

295
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,868
thought group, he's fully pronouncing it. And.

296
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:15,320
And— 

297
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,000
I was wondering if—
I was wondering if, I was wondering if,  

298
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:28,160
I was wondering if. Teeny tiny little lift here, but if you'll notice we have four words here. 

299
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:44,280
I was wondering if. And only one of them has a stress syllable, wondering if, I was. So,  

300
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,640
I was just going up and during if, just going 
down from that one peak of stress. 

301
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:57,366
It's one smooth up down shape of the voice. Uhuh, uhuh, 

302
00:27:57,366 --> 00:28:02,935
I was one wondering if, I was wondering if. Very smooth and connected.

303
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:07,160
I was wondering if— 

304
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:12,080
you and Lola have—
You and Lola have. He  

305
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,060
must feel very shy here because he's putting all of these breaks in. 

306
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:23,692
You and, Lola have. Little bit of a break here and look at this word and.

307
00:28:23,692 --> 00:28:31,277
 Here we said he fully pronounced it, and here he totally doesn't. And, and, you and, 

308
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:39,868
you and. The word and becomes and, and, you and. Link that in smoothly with you. You and.

309
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:46,320
You and Lola have— 

310
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:54,920
You and, you and Lola have. Have, we still 
get all of those sounds but it's still lower,  

311
00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:04,868
flatter, not as long not as loud still has an 
unstressed feeling. Lola have, uhhuh, Lola have. 

312
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:09,153
Lola have—

313
00:29:09,153 --> 00:29:11,000
situation like that. 

314
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,480
And then he does another break. I don't 
even hear the UH sound really. Uh, uh,  

315
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:24,720
uh. Although grammatically, it would be there, uh, situation. He must be saying it so, so quickly,  

316
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,600
and linking it into the S, that it, just didn't 
really get picked up by the mic, a situation. 

317
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,160
Situation—

318
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:43,360
Situation, situation.  

319
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:52,400
So this word has primary stress on a and 
secondary, a little bit of up down on sit, situ. 

320
00:29:52,400 --> 00:30:04,600
The TU here is making a CHU, si-chu-way. 
You might feel here linking these two sounds  

321
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:17,600
that you're making a W to glide them smoothly. Situation. T-I-O-N ending here is SH schwa N,  

322
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:25,799
shu, shun, situation.

323
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,640
Situation— 

324
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,200
a situation like that.
A situation like that,  

325
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,560
like that, like that. Do you hear the difference? They're both getting quieter at the end of the  

326
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:46,496
phrase but like is flatter, like that. That 
up down shape of stress on our vowel, 

327
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:51,560
that, and then he does do a light 
true T release because again,  

328
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:57,657
he's breaking it up from the next part of 
the sentence. He's not linking it together. 

329
00:30:57,657 --> 00:31:03,120
like that—
with someone, 

330
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,610
With someone, with someone, with someone. 

331
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:12,000
A little bit more up down on with. With someone, but overall still pretty flat, 

332
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,222
we have an unvoiced TH here, and then an S sound with someone. Now, it would be 

333
00:31:18,222 --> 00:31:23,134
pretty common to drop the TH and just replace it with an S, with someone,  

334
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:27,223
with someone, with someone, were you there with someone. But here, he doesn't.  

335
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:32,104
He is making a quick little light TH with someone. 

336
00:31:32,104 --> 00:31:38,161
With someone, before he continues, with someone. 

337
00:31:38,161 --> 00:31:42,635
with someone—

338
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:46,991
I wouldn't think of this as being some, but more like some. 

339
00:31:46,991 --> 00:31:51,100
Fast with schwa, some, some, someone, someone. 

340
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:57,400
with someone—
who I need to kill. 

341
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,360
Making a joke here. He wants to be 
the person who takes care of Lola. 

342
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,334
who I need to kill.

343
00:32:06,334 --> 00:32:13,166
Who I need to kill. Now here, no breaks, this is all, all five of these words linking 

344
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:22,073
 together smoothly. Who I need to kill. Who I need to, who I need. One stress word  

345
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:30,594
there, it's our verb. To kill, and another verb, uhuhuh. So those five words, 

346
00:32:30,594 --> 00:32:36,040
two up down shapes of stress, the rest is either leading up to one  

347
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:51,520
peak or coming down. Who I, who I. 
Who ends in oo, I diphthong, who I,  

348
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:59,520
it might help to think of going through a 
W. Who I. That can help you link smoothly. 

349
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,609
who I need to kill.

350
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:11,802
Who I need to, who I need to. So, it's pretty common when one word that ends in D  

351
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:19,433
is linking into the word to, to reduce that to, to just the schwa and link it onto the D. 

352
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:27,920
Need to, need to, need to, need to, need to kill, need to kill. 

353
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:35,427
This L is a dark L, it comes after the vowel in the syllable, kill. 

354
00:33:35,427 --> 00:33:40,898
That's made with the back part of the tongue, not the tip the tip should not lift 
here. 

355
00:33:40,898 --> 00:33:51,020
Kill. Who I need to kill. So many things are happening but slow it down break it up, 

356
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:57,069
practice it in slow motion first, simplify, simplify, and after you've done it in slow 

357
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:01,671
motion many, many times and it's starting to feel more natural then bring it up to 

358
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:06,280
regular pace. So that you can keep everything you simplified like dropping  

359
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:15,000
the D in need, like changing the vowel in to. The smooth link of who and I. It's really about  

360
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,601
saying it out loud, playing it and saying it over and over. Who I need to kill, who I need to kill. 

361
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:26,135
Who I need to kill.

362
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:29,181
Let's listen to the whole conversation one more time. 

363
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:31,840
Lola said you asked about her potato mashers. 

364
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:39,231
Your kid is super dope. And, I was thinking, I used to help out families in my neighborhood,  

365
00:34:39,231 --> 00:34:43,239
like, if parents wanted a night out, 
I would stay with their kids or like,  

366
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:47,338
even watch their house, and I was wondering if you and Lola 

367
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:51,744
have a situation like that with someone, who I need to kill.  

368
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:56,772
