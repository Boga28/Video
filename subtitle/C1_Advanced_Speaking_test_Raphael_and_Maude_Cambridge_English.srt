00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:21,190
Examiner: Good morning. My name is Bridget Harrison, and this is my colleague Mary Whiteside. And your names are?  

2
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,645
Raphael
Maude

3
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:29,484
Examiner: Can I have your mark sheets please? Thank you.

4
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:37,821
Examiner: First of all, we'd like to know something about you. Raphael where are you from?

5
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:43,173
Raphael: I'm from Lucerne. It's a city in Switzerland and it's in the German part.

6
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:45,160
Examiner: And what do you do there?

7
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,565
Raphael: I'm still at school and have two years to go.

8
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:52,666
Examiner: Maude how long have you been studying English?

9
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:58,679
Maude: Well I think I've been studying English for about six years now, yes.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,162
Examiner: What do you enjoy most about learning English?

11
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:17,880
Maude: It's mmm it is very useful, I mean to talk with friends. I have a lot of friends in France, and I really enjoy being able to talk with them.

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,678
Examiner: Maude do you think you spend too much time working or studying?

13
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:36,126
Maude: Well sometimes maybe because I'm hard working, I like it. And sometimes think I should rest take time to rest, yes.

14
00:01:36,126 --> 00:01:37,554
Examiner: Why?

15
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:56,665
Maude: mmm because well I when I study I stayed at home. I didn't go out with friends a lot. I didn't, like, working at the cafe or something. So it's not very a social activity, yeah. So I should be with my friends and go out.

16
00:01:56,665 --> 00:02:02,283
Examiner: Raphael do you like using the Internet to keep in touch with people?

17
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:09,785
Raphael: Yes sometimes, but to keep in touch with people I think it's better to see them face-to-face not just writing.

18
00:02:09,785 --> 00:02:18,452
So but like something like Facebook I think it's useful like in contact book, but not really as interaction between people.

19
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,794
Examiner: In this part of the test I'm going to give each 
of you three pictures.

20
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:36,500
I'd like you to talk about two of them on your own for about a minute, and also to answer a question briefly about your partner's pictures.

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:44,128
Raphael it's your turn first. Here are your pictures they show people doing things together.

22
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:53,349
I'd like you to compare two of the pictures and say why the people might be doing these things together and how the people might be feeling.

23
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:03,251
Raphael: So I think these two guys are playing just music together.

24
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:09,326
And these three little girls are baking I don't know, a cake or something.

25
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:17,567
And I think here they are doing it together because they might be sisters because they look so similar.

26
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:29,057
And these two are maybe in a band or in a music group, and I think they enjoy to play together music and interact with together.

27
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:47,779
And these three girls just like to have fun here and bake in the kitchen. I don't think it will be a nice cake but yes just to learn how to cook, and it's just an activity for them together.

28
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:56,954
And I think the both guys could also be preparing for something maybe concert or something but.

29
00:03:56,954 --> 00:04:05,395
Examiner: Thank you Raphael. Maude, in which situation do you think the people benefit most from being together?

30
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:15,901
Maude: Well I think every kind of situation depends on the kind of relationship you have with the person.

31
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:28,293
When you're at school, maybe in a class, it's good to talk with some people sometimes just to think about something else, and when you're cooking the same you share ideas. 

32
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:33,750
You learn things when you're playing music. You, well you learn about each other.  

33
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,299
So it really depends on the situation.

34
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,146
Examiner: Thank you.

35
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:47,873
Examiner: Now Maude, here are your pictures. They show students doing different activities.

36
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:55,325
I'd like you to compare two of the activities and say how students can benefit from doing these activities,

37
00:04:55,325 --> 00:05:00,947
and how helpful the activities might be in preparing them for their future lives. Alright?

38
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:08,442
Maude: OK. So, let me see. So I'd like  to talk about these two pictures.

39
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:16,693
Well, on these two pictures we can see two students are doing different things.

40
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:31,014
I think she is studying so, well while studying she gained knowledge and she get prepared for a test maybe something.

41
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:36,072
So it helps her preparing it and maybe she will pass the test if she worked hard.

42
00:05:36,072 --> 00:05:52,660
so and this student is giving a presentation, and it helps her it will help her develop a kind of ease while talking to other people.

43
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:04,172
So if she wants to be, well in maybe in entertainment field it will be very useful for her to be able to talk to people.

44
00:06:04,172 --> 00:06:06,484
Examiner: Thank You.

45
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:10,813
Raphael, which of these activities do you think is most useful?

46
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:16,291
Raphael: I think it's this one where they build a.  I think it's a tent or something.

47
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:34,246
Because it helps for the teamwork and I think that's the most important thing for a future life because when they are like in the office or just at a job they have to be prepared to work in the team and ask others about their opinion and work together with them.

48
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:36,000
Examiner: Thank you.

49
00:06:40,022 --> 00:06:45,395
Examiner: Now I'd like you to talk about something together for about two minutes.

50
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:52,128
Here are some things that people often have to make decisions about and a question for you to discuss.

51
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:55,840
First you have some time to look at the task.

52
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:22,400
Examiner: Now talk to each other about what people might 
have to consider when making these decisions.

53
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:34,230
Maude: OK. So let's talk about choosing a university first. 
I think people have to think of that well first  

54
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,892
the students have to think about what they like of course when they choose a university.

55
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:41,094
Raphael: What they want to study.

56
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:57,063
Maude: Yeah. And students and the parents have to think about money because in some countries universities is very very expensive like in England here.

57
00:07:57,063 --> 00:08:07,816
Raphael: And I think you have also to choose the right university for like where you can study the subject you will want to.

58
00:08:07,816 --> 00:08:17,706
And also that the university with the subject is the 
best university but from all the universities with the subject.

59
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:21,659
Maude: Like, the best results in an exam or something like that.

60
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:33,864
Maude: And what about starting your family. Mmm again there is a financial criteria to consider I think.

61
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:42,782
And well when you start a family you need to talk maybe 
about children.

62
00:08:42,782 --> 00:08:48,025
Raphael: Yeah. Yeah also to think about ready already.
Maude: Yes.

63
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:53,357
Raphael: To build a family, and if you have enough money and. 
Maude: Snd where to settle and. 

64
00:08:53,357 --> 00:09:07,709
Maude: To think about the jobs maybe because I think that's now most of the parents. I mean two parents are working so they need to
Raphael: Yeah
Maude: to take that in consideration.

65
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:17,332
Maude: And moving to another country. I think the language is very important. 
Raphael: Yeah.

66
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:30,178
Maude: And there are some restrictions as well about languages, like if you want to move to Australia you need to pass the IELTS exam.

67
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:39,558
Examiner: Thank you. Now you have about a minute to decide in which situation it's most important to make the right decision.

68
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:55,398
Maude: OK.
Raphael: I think the most important is getting married because when two people find each other and they think about getting married they should really think about it because it's an important decision.

69
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:56,606
Maude: Yeah I agree with you.

70
00:09:56,606 --> 00:10:12,672
Raphael: Can't just get married, yeah.
Maude:  Mhm, yes then you have to sign a contract and you're those people are together for a whole their lives so they need to think about it before getting married.

71
00:10:12,672 --> 00:10:18,119
Raphael: I think this is also connected to starting a family because. 
Maude: Yes. Maybe moving to another country.

72
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:21,816
Raphael: Well yeah.
Maude: Yes everything realizing it.
Raphael: Yeah.

73
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:35,207
Maude: So, yeah.
Raphael: And, yeah, and also when you when you are and get married I think it's better to first get married before you start family

74
00:10:35,207 --> 00:10:39,345
because then you're like a couple. Yeah.

75
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:43,680
Maude: Kind of, yes, legal couple.

76
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,547
Examiner: Thank you.

77
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:56,821
Examiner: Raphael, is it best for people to make decisions on their own or to ask others for advice?

78
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:00,818
Raphael: Yeah I think it's always important to consider other opinion

79
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:05,200
because they have a different view on the topic on their question

80
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,367
and so I think it's always important to ask as many people as possible and consider the different points.

81
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:14,184
Examiner: Do you agree Maude?

82
00:11:14,184 --> 00:11:22,773
Maude: Well in some ways yes, but I think that some people can should make their own decision when

83
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:30,866
the thing that's the advice that old people give them are not very strong. So, yes.

84
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:42,232
Examiner: Maude, some people think it's best to plan their lives carefully. Others prefer to make spontaneous decisions. What's  your opinion?

85
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:51,899
Maude: Well again it depends on the individuals and mmm I think that planning your life is very important.

86
00:11:51,899 --> 00:12:00,484
Like in my opinion planning studies and holidays is very important because

87
00:12:00,484 --> 00:12:14,204
when you study you don't have a lot of time to come to leave to holiday, so if you book a holiday or something like that you need to think about it before.

88
00:12:14,204 --> 00:12:15,893
Examiner: Do you agree, Raphael?

89
00:12:15,893 --> 00:12:21,325
Raphael: Yes I agree but I think it's also important that we don't plan everything because

90
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:31,115
when we don't reach it at the end we may be depressed and so it's always just the most important thing we should plan.

91
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:38,531
Examiner: Why do you think some people find it harder to make decisions than others?

92
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:46,289
Maude: I think that some people are not very used to make their own decisions like
Raphael: Yes.

93
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:53,523
Maude: when you have very pushy parents you don't really get to make your own decision.

94
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:59,757
Raphael: And maybe some people are scared about about following. 
Maude: Yes.

95
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:02,515
Maude: The other opinions or. 

96
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:17,944
Raphael: And also it's it's like I think it's like you either you are very good at make making decision then you should also be like a leader for group or something.

97
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:25,088
But when you don't I think it's better when you just listen to someone else.
Maude: Yes, listen to someone's advice, yeah.

98
00:13:26,116 --> 00:13:32,958
Examiner: How do you think young people can be helped to take on responsibilities?

99
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:42,034
Raphael: Um I think it's important that they are teached in school about this and also from the parents at home.

100
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:54,192
Maude: Yes. Very important the parents I think play a very important role because there are like an example for the children.

101
00:13:54,192 --> 00:14:09,951
and mmm yes, they should teach them the good way of, well making decision and how to pre think about how to make a decision yeah.

102
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:18,424
Raphael: I think you can also start an early age with like giving them little tasks to do. 
Maude: mm-hmm

103
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:24,407
Raphael: And then they have to the responsibility to do the task and and they learn what it mean.

104
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:30,350
Maude: Yes, I often ask them questions like 'what do you want?', 'what do you think?'

105
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,809
so that they can talk and share their ideas and give their opinion about things

106
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:41,008
and develop this kind of skill. 
Raphael: Yeah.

107
00:14:41,008 --> 00:14:44,132
Maude: Yes. Tasking.

108
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:56,873
Raphael: Also in the job they will get tasks from their boss, and then they also know what it mean that they get tasks done, and yeah.

109
00:14:56,873 --> 00:15:03,519
Maude: Yes and encourage them to do their homework how thing like that when they're very young.

110
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,240
Examiner: Thank you. That is the end of the test.
