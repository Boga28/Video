1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
So I'm happy to report we have succeeded in rerouting our flagships.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,260
Way ahead of schedule, yet again.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,260
This has allowed us to improve our USPs by 90%.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,300
That's 9 out of every 10!

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,700
Excellent, thank you Samuel.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,500
Timothy, what's the status with the Linear Solutions?

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,060
Could you give us the latest on the Square project?

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,380
The Linear Solutions department has yet again functioned at full capacity.

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,260
And we have fulfilled a 114% of this month's objectives.

10
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,300
You can read the handouts for a detailed account,

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,860
but in short, as I reported last week, we've decided to use the right angle for the Square project.

12
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,260
Now, there's still some debate as to how big a right angle is,

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:51,140
so we're testing currently at 90, 97, 100 and 101 degrees.

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,900
As agreed, I've ensured Anderson crosschecks the design removing any left angles

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,260
and doesn't use them in future.

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,780
Overall, we have very good progress with the design.

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,940
Are we on track with the schedule? When are we required to start delivering?

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,140
I'm happy to report that we are ready to start first deliveries tomorrow

19
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,820
which is way ahead of the requested delivery schedule.

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,860
We've only just finished system testing the prototype

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,460
and are only halfway through performance testing.

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,420
We haven't even released an alpha version, yet!

23
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,940
As I said earlier, we've had very good progress with the design.

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,100
Yes, we've had very good progress;

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,420
but I'd say the design of the product is only 75% complete.

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,060
Well exactly! That's 3 out of every 4

27
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,340
so we're ready to start shipping tomorrow.

28
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,540
What? It... It doesn't work like that!

29
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,300
We'll produce, say, 4 units, but only ship the first 3!

30
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,260
Then when you're finally a 100% complete with the design --

31
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,740
-- we can then ship the 4th.

32
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,740
Excellent work Timothy, you can proceed with the production!

33
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,140
Anderson, send me, please, a revised delivery schedule, so I can share it with the client.

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,900
Well, thank you everyone, this was very productive.

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
Yet again!

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,100
FINAL DELIVERY SCHEDULE

37
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,940
REVISED DELIVERY SCHEDULE
