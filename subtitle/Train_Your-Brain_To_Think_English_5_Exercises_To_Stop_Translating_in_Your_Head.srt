1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,160
Let’s think in English. When you can build 
a habit for your brain thinking in English,  

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,440
it’ll make expressing yourself, English 
conversation so much easier and faster.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,800
There are steps you can take to 
build this habit in your brain  

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,440
and today we’re going to do exactly that.

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
I’m also going to give you an assignment 
so you can keep going with this practice.  

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,360
Together, we’re going to make 
awesome things happen for you.

7
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,200
And don’t forget, if you like this 
video or you learn something new,  

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,279
please give it a thumbs up and don’t 
forget to subscribe with notifications.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
Did you know that there are actually 
step by step exercises that you can do  

10
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,880
to build your brain’s habit of thinking in 
English. You can practice anywhere because  

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,640
well, it’s thinking, it’s in your head. It’s 
not like you need to practice out loud. Today  

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,452
we’re focusing on training your brain to 
quickly go to English by focusing on words.  

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,160
Sometimes we do whole phrases but today we’re 
just doing words. And if ever you can’t think  

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,345
of one of the words, you don’t know it, 
no problem. We’ll go over everything.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,080
Let’s just start with me. For ten 
seconds, think of every word you can  

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,328
that describes what you see in English. 
They can be very basic words. Ready? Go.

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,240
There’s so many things you could have said.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,403
Woman, hair, gray hair, gray streak, 
shirt, white with blue pattern,  

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:55,927
plain background, eyebrow, hairline, nostril, 
ear, ear lobe, neck, chin, jaw, lips, smile.

20
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,720
Maybe you went into words that describe things 
you can’t see like teacher. Maybe even you use  

21
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,880
the word friend. Were any of these words new to 
you? Watch this part again, pause at the new word  

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:14,560
and make up a sentence using it. Close your 
eyes, think of a sentence, think the picture.  

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,160
This will help you remember. Now, the same 
thing only not me, do yourself. Think words in  

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,266
English that describe your 
appearance. What you’re wearing. Ten seconds. Go.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,960
Now we’ll look at my environment, where I am now, 
my office. It’s a little bit messy, it always is  

26
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,187
no matter how hard I try. So this is a little 
seventeen second clip, a scan of my office.  

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,900
Let your mind bring up all the 
English words for what you’re seeing.

28
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,445
Now let’s go over some of 
the words you may have said.

29
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,760
Tree, window, window sill, 
window pane, office chair,  

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:45,840
storage cube, light switch, blinds, power 
lines, tree, shelves, books, plants, planters,  

31
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:54,000
cactus. I have a lot of plants don’t I? Maybe you 
notice I have some of them up on two yoga blocks.  

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,920
And some on mixing bowls I turned upside 
down. I even have a pair of tiny dumbbells  

33
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,705
so I can do a quick little ten-minute arm 
workouts when I need a break from work.

34
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:12,080
Laptop, door, door knob. What’s this? 
It’s a sign I put outside my door when  

35
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,279
I don’t want to be disturbed. 
It’s like a do not disturb sign,  

36
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,106
only since my kids can’t read, 
it’s just an X. What else?

37
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:34,705
Hinge, floor, baseboard, corner, rug, 
lights, equipment, cords, outlet, ring light,  

38
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:46,248
overhead lights, pull cords for my ceiling fan, 
magazine, glasses case, poster, flowers, vase,  

39
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:57,387
desk, stamps, tissues, papers, 
calendar, water bottle, hard drives,  

40
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:12,570
candle, lamp, coaster, computer, daybed, 
pillow, duvet, vent, wall, ceiling, fan.

41
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,487
And maybe you saw some things 
that I didn’t even notice.  

42
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,686
Maybe some of the things you saw, 
you didn’t know the English word for.  

43
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,960
And now you do. Now, you’re going to do 
this for yourself, your own environment.

44
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,720
An exercise like this is great because it’s simple 
and it can have a couple of benefits. First,  

45
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,200
when you tell yourself I’m going to think 
of these things in English. It trains your  

46
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,880
brain to do just that. To think in English without 
having to translate from your own native language.

47
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,120
The other benefit is you’re building 
vocabulary that is incredibly useful  

48
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:54,640
to you. Because you’re using words in your 
life relevant for you. For example, the word  

49
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,800
ring light. From my office is 
not relevant to most people.  

50
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,505
But around you, everything is a word that it 
would be useful for you to know in English.

51
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,817
First, do the exercise for just ten seconds 
where you name things in English, go!

52
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,360
Now take a minute to look around your environment 
more, is there anything that you don’t know how  

53
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,080
to say in English? Think just three of these 
things and look them up in a translator. Get  

54
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,560
the English word, think it a few times or say 
it. Look at the object. Close your eyes and  

55
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,760
visualize yourself making the scan around your 
room again. And thinking the word in English.  

56
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,370
If you have a method of tracking and learning 
vocabulary, add these new words to your list.

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,120
Now, let’s take a scene from a movie. We’re 
going to watch it together. It's a short scene,  

58
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,548
it’s full of objects. Tell your mind now, name 
the things you see in English. Let’s watch.

59
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,480
Oh, hello.

60
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,120
Oh, hello.

61
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,320
Hi, how are you?

62
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,942
Fine.

63
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,720
This scene by the way is from the movie “Good 
Will Hunting”. A few days ago, I posted on  

64
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,840
Instagram asking you to suggest movies, TV, 
even specific scenes to use to learn English  

65
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,807
and Good Will Hunting is a movie that came 
up. Thanks everyone for your suggestions.

66
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,170
Let’s go back now and name some objects.

67
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,466
Okay, we have a lot of people. They all 
seem to be men in this shot. We’re in a bar,  

68
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,600
I see a lot of baseball caps or baseball 
hats. He’s wearing a jacket, these are taps,  

69
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:59,840
they’re for pouring draft beer out of a keg. 
We have a lot of glasses. This looks like it  

70
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,544
might be an ashtray. You can’t smoke in doors 
in the US anymore but this movie is pretty old.  

71
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,160
Pendant lights. There are a couple of neon 
signs. A string of colored lights. This  

72
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:20,800
guy has on a watch. He just grabbed a glass of 
beer. We start to see another character. Woman.  

73
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,720
She’s wearing a tank top. It could also be called 
a camisole. When a shirt or dress has really thin  

74
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,080
straps like this, we call them spaghetti 
straps. She has her hair on a ponytail.

75
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,199
Now we see another character. She has 
a bar barrette and you can see the part  

76
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,763
of her hair. She has on a T-shirt, it’s 
striped. The flag above also has stripes.  

77
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,682
He has a cut on his face. He has a logo 
on his shirt. You can see her collarbone.

78
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,148
You can get very detailed. And don’t 
forget to look up words you don’t know.  

79
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,507
This is such a great way to build 
your vocabulary. Your assignment is:

80
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Do this at least once tomorrow whether you’re 
at home or somewhere totally new. Take a minute  

81
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,160
to think of the names of things around you In 
English. Then put in the comments below where  

82
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,280
you were when you did this exercise. And 
if you love it, do it every day. The more  

83
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:26,240
consistent you are with asking your mind to think 
in English, the easier for your mind to go there  

84
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,989
and respond in English. Now, we’ll review all 
the words we went over together. See the object,  

85
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,959
read the word and think the word in 
your head. Build that connection.

86
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,200
Thanks for learning with me, I really love 
teaching you. Keep your learning now with  

87
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,520

and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.
