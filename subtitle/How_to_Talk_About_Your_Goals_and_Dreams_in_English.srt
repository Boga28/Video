1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,210
I'm sure when you
think about the future,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,260
there's things that you're hoping for.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,470
There's things that you're planning to do,

4
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,020
but maybe you're not quite sure

5
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,310
how to express how you
feel about that in English.

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,500
Well, in this English lesson,

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,110
I will teach you a whole bunch
of phrases that you can use

8
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,470
to talk about things
that you're hoping for,

9
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,800
goals that you have set,

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,515
and things that you are
planning to do in the future.

11
00:00:21,515 --> 00:00:24,182
(upbeat music)

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,370
Before we get this lesson started,

13
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:30,150
I should mention one thing.

14
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:32,302
I'm sure you already
know how to use phrases

15
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:35,500
like I am going to, or I will,

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,870
to talk about things you are
going to do in the future.

17
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,703
And in this lesson,

18
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:42,880
I'm not going to help you
learn the future tenses.

19
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,670
Instead, I'm going to teach
you some other phrases

20
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,930
that English speakers commonly use

21
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,560
when they're talking about
things that they are going to do.

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,640
So stick around for that.

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,930
Before we get started, though,

24
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,500
if this is your first time here,

25
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,490
don't forget to click
that red subscribe button,

26
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,410
and give me a thumbs up

27
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,930
if this video helps you learn

28
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,420
just a little bit more English.

29
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,330
The first three phrases that you can use

30
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,489
to talk about your dreams and goals

31
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,000
all start with the same word.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
They start with the word someday.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,190
And the first phrase is
the phrase I plan to.

34
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,570
I really like France.

35
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,770
I'm a French speaker, but
I've never been to France.

36
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,940
So someday I plan to go to France.

37
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:22,740
You can see how someday
refers to a day in the future,

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,780
not a specific day, but
because I speak French,

39
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,790
and because the country
of France is really cool,

40
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,140
someday, I plan to go to France.

41
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,975
So that's the first phrase.

42
00:01:31,975 --> 00:01:35,280
The second phrase is the phrase I hope to,

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,090
and you can use this again
with the word someday.

44
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:41,280
Once I was talking to a student,
and the student said this.

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,310
Someday, I hope to become a doctor.

46
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,890
The student was studying
really hard in my class.

47
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,990
Their plan was to go to
university, and to become a doctor.

48
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,490
And the way they expressed that dream,

49
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,870
the way they expressed that goal

50
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,760
was to say someday, I
hope to become a doctor.

51
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,060
The last phrase that you can
use with the word someday

52
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,260
is the phrase I would like to,

53
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,320
and we shorten this to I'd like to,

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,130
so you might say something like this.

55
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,030
Someday, I'd like to visit Canada.

56
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,200
Someday, I'd like to see
a Toronto Raptors game.

57
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,570
I've watched them on TV, but
I've never gone to a game.

58
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,410
So someday, I'd like to go and
see a Toronto Raptors game.

59
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,578
So those are the first three phrases

60
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:23,700
you can start all of your
sentences with someday

61
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,550
to talk about something that
you want to do in the future,

62
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,630
one of your dreams, or one of your goals.

63
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,980
Another way to talk about
your dreams or goals

64
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,740
is to simply state your dream or goal.

65
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,410
And the phrase we use to
do this is the phrase,

66
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,470
one of my dreams is,
or one of my goals is.

67
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,610
For me, I would probably say this.

68
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,610
One of my dreams is to
have 1 million subscribers

69
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,510
on YouTube.

70
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,420
That would be kind of surprising,

71
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,000
and I don't even know if I
would be able to believe it

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,200
if it happened.

73
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,300
You might say this.

74
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,000
You might say one of my goals

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,470
is to become fluent in English.

76
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,137
So it's a very simple way to do it,

77
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,140
but this is the phrase we most often use

78
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,310
when we talk specifically
about a dream or goal.

79
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,440
We say one of my dreams
is, or one of my goals is.

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,520
Another way we talk about our
dreams or goals in English

81
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,510
is to use the phrase I dream of a day.

82
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,170
This is a phrase we once again use

83
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,260
to talk about something
we really want to happen.

84
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,358
You might use a phrase like this.

85
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:25,010
I dream of a day when
I can own my own house.

86
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,660
You might use a phrase like this.

87
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,560
I dream of a day when COVID
is gone from the world.

88
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,280
I certainly dream of that day.

89
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,440
I dream of a day where
there is no more pandemic.

90
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,630
That would be really, really awesome.

91
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,490
But anyways, another phrase that we use

92
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,940
to talk about the future,

93
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,680
to talk about a dream or goal
is to say I dream of a day.

94
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,006
Another way to talk about something

95
00:03:46,006 --> 00:03:48,140
that's going to happen in the future

96
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,530
that you're excited about

97
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,730
is to use the phrase
I'm looking forward to.

98
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,586
Christmas is coming up,

99
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:56,130
and I'm looking forward to Christmas.

100
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,900
It means I get a break from school.

101
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,280
It means I get to spend
some time with my family.

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,860
So I'm looking forward to Christmas.

103
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,630
You might be looking forward
to your next holiday.

104
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,600
You might even just be looking
forward to the weekend.

105
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,048
I know today I'm making
this video on a Friday,

106
00:04:11,048 --> 00:04:13,860
and I'm looking forward to the weekend.

107
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,980
Eventually this day will be over.

108
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,300
It will be the weekend, and
I'll be pretty excited about it.

109
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,649
But right now I'm just
looking forward to it.

110
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:23,010
Obviously, when something's in the future,

111
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,260
you have to wait for it to happen.

112
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,650
A phrase that we use though
to talk about how we feel

113
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,583
when we want something
to happen really badly

114
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:33,140
is the phrase I can't wait.

115
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,860
My son went to university this past year.

116
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,600
And during the summer, a
few times he said this,

117
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,240
I can't wait to go to university.

118
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,297
I can't wait to go inside
the house right now,

119
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,389
because I'm outside.

120
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:46,400
I have a jacket on and no gloves,

121
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,210
and it's actually quite cold.

122
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,500
So I know it's a small thing
that I'm looking forward to.

123
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,820
It's a small thing that I'm going to do,

124
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,230
but right now I can't wait to go inside.

125
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,880
I do enjoy making these videos,

126
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,250
but my hands are getting
a little bit cold.

127
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,880
Well thank you for watching
this little English lesson,

128
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
where I hope you learned a
few phrases that you can use

129
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,230
to talk about your
dreams and goals in life

130
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,300
when you have your next
English conversation.

131
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,090

just a little bit more English.

135
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,900
And if you have the time,

136
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,130
why don't you stick around,

137
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,092
