00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:07,440
hi there it's asiya i've taken the ielts exam four 
times and i want to tell you what you can expect  

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,920
at the beginning of this exam and how to make 
a great first impression okay let's get started  

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,520
you might know that ielts examiners use four 
criteria to assess your ielts speaking answers  

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,400
and you may find all of them in the ielts band 
descriptors but ultimately there says how well  

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,120
you can communicate in english how comfortable 
you are expressing your thoughts in english  

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,560
and how natural you feel doing that so don't 
think that you need to be creative or original  

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,120
don't think that you need to give complex answers 
more complex than you would normally say and  

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,520
don't think that your thoughts should be smart 
that is not required and that is not assessed  

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,800
now let me tell you what you can expect at 
the very beginning of this exam and how to  

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,640
behave to look natural you'll be waiting in 
the corridor for the examiner to call you  

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,360
and invite you into the room when you enter 
say hi or hello these are typical ways to  

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,640
greet an examiner if you say good afternoon it's 
a little bit too formal and people don't really  

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,280
use that in english unless they're in a 
very formal situation like a presentation  

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
just say hi hello some examiners start the exam 
straight away while others have a little chat with  

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,760
you first for example once the examiner talked 
to me for almost a minute and he asked me about  

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,280
my exam why i'm taking it what are my 
future plans and so on and only then  

17
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:08,560
he started the exam while another examiner opened 
the door and said this exam is recorded and so  

18
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,680
the exam started straight away she didn't even say 
hello without the record your ielts speaking exam  

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,560
will be recorded and the examiner will 
have this little recorder in front of them  

20
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,920
so a good indication when your exam officially 
starts is when the examiner presses the button  

21
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,880
to start the recording and says this exam is 
recorded at the very beginning they will ask  

22
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,360
you several questions the first one is what's 
your name and you can just give your full  

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:53,120
passport name without anything else asean or 
it's rcm yard or i'm assuming art nothing else  

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:03,840
next they ask what should i call you meaning what 
name should i use to address you some people use a  

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,120
different name and some people use a short version 
of their name so you can say just call me asia or  

26
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:19,520
call me liz if your name is elizabeth for example 
next they ask can i see your passport just say  

27
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:27,760
sure or here it is you don't need to be wordy 
the next question is where are you from i could  

28
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,560
say i'm from kyrgyzstan uh that's one of the 
republics of the former soviet union or i'm from  

29
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:42,160
almaty that's the former capital of kazakhstan 
actually both are true you could say i'm from rome  

30
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,000
i'm from the south of france or i'm from delhi 
but i've been living in mumbai for most of my life  

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,120
just give a short answer don't try to impress the 
examiner these questions are simply to collect  

32
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:05,280
some information about you be prepared that each 
examiner is different some are friendly attentive  

33
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:12,000
they show that they listen to you they show that 
they understand what you're saying others are  

34
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,600
completely different your examiner may not even 
look at you your examiner may take some notes  

35
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:26,320
or look down or look out of the window don't 
let it get to you they can easily assess your  

36
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,520
performance but can you perform at your best 
if you get distracted just concentrate on  

37
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:40,560
what you need to do you need to speak and answer 
questions the rest doesn't matter and be prepared  

38
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,000
that your examiner may interrupt you they 
manage in time so when it's time to move  

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,360
on to the next question they will interrupt 
you even if you haven't finished your answer  

40
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,840
in part 3 your examiner may even challenge you he 
or she may interrupt you and say is it always so  

41
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:06,640
is it always the case asking you to prove your 
point of view and perhaps it's a good sign perhaps  

42
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:13,120
they think that you can cope with this pressure 
and your english is quite good but whatever it  

43
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,480
is these interruptions don't affect your score 
so don't get upset about it after the examiner  

44
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:28,800
has collected all the information from you he or 
she will say now i'd like to ask you about on now  

45
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,320
i'm going to ask you several questions about and 
give you the topic that's the beginning of part  

46
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:45,280
one in part one you will get three topics and only 
the first one is easy to predict it will be one of  

47
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:55,120
these four your hometown your home your family or 
your work studies and these questions are there  

48
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:03,440
to warm you up so don't think that you need to 
give long or complex answers just give two three  

49
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,640
sentences and again they don't have to be highly 
complex you may be asked what is your hometown  

50
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:19,120
and some people get confused about this question 
basically your hometown is where you were born or  

51
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:27,120
where you lived as a child i could say my hometown 
is almaty it's the former capital of kazakhstan  

52
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,200
and that's where i was born this answer is long 
enough don't think that you need to give a very  

53
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:40,480
long answer to each question no i live in london 
and i've been here for 10 years but london is not  

54
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,960
my hometown because i didn't spend my childhood 
here you see and maybe you lived in several  

55
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,280
different locations just pick one and talk about 
it it doesn't really matter which one you pick  

56
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:01,520
now i'm going to show you another answer think 
if anything is wrong with it the question is the  

57
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:10,240
same what is your hometown and the answer is my 
hometown is called almaty and it is a magnificent  

58
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,600
city located in southern kazakhstan with a 
population of over 1 million inhabitants what  

59
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:25,120
do you think is it a good answer it's much more 
complex than the first one isn't it the problem is  

60
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:34,000
it's too formal for spoken english it sounds like 
it could be written somewhere it sounds unnatural  

61
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:42,560
and the problem is that the examiner may suspect 
that that's a memorized answer it's very important  

62
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,000
to speak naturally and it's very important not 
to learn any answers by heart don't try to give  

63
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,520
answers which are artificially complex in parts 
2 and 3 you will have chances to use your more  

64
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,560
complex vocabulary and grammar much more naturally 
the first impression still matters and it's good  

65
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,280
if you can answer these first questions 
confidently you can find out what questions  

66
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,080
examiners typically ask you can get some ideas 
of what you could talk about you could learn some  

67
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:26,640
phrases and some words to express yourself more 
precisely just don't memorize whole sample answers  

68
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,680
and you can do all that by watching 
my other videos about family and home  

69
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,200
