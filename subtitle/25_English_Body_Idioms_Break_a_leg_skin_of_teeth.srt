1
00:00:02,131 --> 00:00:04,714
(gentle music)

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,230
- Hello everyone,

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,240
and welcome back to English with Lucy.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,632
Today, we are going to discuss body idioms

5
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:20,930
and there are a lot of them.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,850
Today we are going to talk about 25

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,850
of the most commonly used idioms
relating to the human body.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,110
I haven't done an idioms video in so long

9
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,220
and I've had quite a lot
of requests for them.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,300
So I think this is a
really, really good topic

11
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,730
to come back with.

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,510
As always, I have created a free PDF

13
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,030
that goes with this lesson.

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:47,400
It contains everything we'll
speak about today plus a quiz.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,520
If you'd like to download that free PDF,

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,750
just click on the link

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,370

automatically in your inbox.

20
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,830
And then every week after that,

you automatically receive my lesson PDFs

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,110
along with my news, updates and offers.

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:10,580
Firstly, a quick message from
the sponsor of today's video,

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:15,150
Lingoda, Europe's number
one, trusted language school.

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,590
I have an opportunity for you

26
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,550
to make the most of
what's left of this year.

27
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,470
Lingoda is running a two
month language sprint,

28
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,060
which is an intensive challenge
where you take either 15

29
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,410
or 30 classes per month for two months.

30
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,100
Now, you know that I always say

31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,880
that maintaining motivations,

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,510
staying motivated is
one of the hardest parts

33
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,220
of learning a language

34
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,270
and Lingoda have such a huge
motivational push for you.

35
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,900
You can get 100% cashback if
you attend all of your classes

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,530
or 50%, if you take the
lighter sprint option.

37
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,270
Lingoda is amazing because
they have incredible

38
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,400
qualified teachers and their
group class sizes are so small.

39
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,400
You can attend classes 24/7
from anywhere in the world.

40
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,740
Their classes are of such high quality

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,009
with lots of speaking,
practise and interaction.

42
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,270
Join the sprint and boost
your fluency in just 60 days

43
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,120
and use the incredible cashback prize

44
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,100
as the ultimate motivational push.

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,900
Sign up with my link below

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,560
and use my code Lucy 20

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,600
Make sure that you also read
the terms and conditions.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,050
Right, let's get started with the lesson.

49
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,080
Right we're going to go through
these in alphabetical order.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,820
Number one, is all ears.

51
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,100
All ears, and I hope you can see

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,040
and appreciate my toast,

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,750
my buttered toast earrings today.

54
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,310
I just thought they weren't quite well.

55
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,010
If you are all ears, then it
means you are fully listening.

56
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,720
Let me finish hanging out the washing

57
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,230
and then I'll be all ears.

58
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,880
I'll be fully listening to you.

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,810
It's a nice way of saying I
can't concentrate right now

60
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,770
because I'm busy, but in a
second, I'll be fully listening.

61
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll be all ears.

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,960
Number two, you might know this one,

63
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,930
this is normally one of the
first idioms that people learn

64
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,560
apart from it's raining cats
and dogs, which we never say.

65
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,520
It is, break a leg.

66
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,680
Break a leg, and this means good luck.

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,930
It's most commonly used for actors

68
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,360
or musicians that are
going to perform onstage.

69
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,770
An example, I forgot you're
on stage tonight, break a leg.

70
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,620
Number three, moving on to teeth.

71
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,500
(laughs)This one is by
the skin of one's teeth.

72
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,030
And this means only just or barely

73
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,720
the skin or the enamel
on your teeth is so thin,

74
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,230
you only just did something.

75
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,450
This example is true.

76
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:49,460
I passed my driving test
by the skin of my teeth.

77
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,560
I really did one more mistake
and I wouldn't have passed.

78
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,620
This is interesting, actually fun fact.

79
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,220
I turned up to my driving test four times,

80
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,040
but I only failed twice.

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,520
Because one time I turned up
and I hadn't clicked confirm

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,230
when booking in my test.

83
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,980
So I was all nervous waiting there,

84
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,340
turns out I didn't have a test that day,

85
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,320
I had to wait another month (laughs).

86
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,860
Number four moving down to feet.

87
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,610
Cold feet, to have cold feet.

88
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,140
If you get cold feet
or you have cold feet,

89
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,539
it means you suddenly feel
nervous about something.

90
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,540
Something usually important
that you plan to do.

91
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,850
And it's often used before weddings.

92
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,490
If somebody suddenly thinks,

93
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,670
ah, is this actually what I want?

94
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,510
It means they're getting cold feet,

95
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,420
they're suddenly doubting

96
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,970
whether they want to do something or not.

97
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,550
They're getting nervous.

98
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,210
An example, I hope he
doesn't get cold feet

99
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,730
before the wedding.

100
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,960
Number five, moving on to arms,

101
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,610
but still involving the legs.

102
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,640
To cost an arm and a leg.

103
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,510
If something costs an arm and a leg,

104
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,910
then it is very expensive.

105
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,400
An example, I bet that coat
cost her an arm and a leg.

106
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,860
I bet that coat was so expensive.

107
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,660
Number six, eyes or heart.

108
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,170
To cry your eyes out or
to cry your heart out.

109
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,380
I would say in British
English to cry your eyes out

110
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,470
is more commonly used.

111
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,120
I wonder in American English,

112
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,410
if any speakers of American
English are watching,

113
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,240
please let me know in
the comments section.

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,810
This means to cry a lot.

115
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,960
Just crying your eyes out,
she was crying so much.

116
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,420
An example, she cried her eyes
out when she lost her cat.

117
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,350
Number seven, moving on to chest.

118
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,120
To get something off your chest.

119
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,790
This means to tell someone
what's been on your mind

120
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,310
or to tell someone one of your problems.

121
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,490
It's a heavy load on your
chest and you get it off.

122
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,220
An example, I need to get it off my chest

123
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,360
and tell my boss that I am unhappy.

124
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,780
Number eight, hands.

125
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,890
To give a hand or to lend a hand.

126
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,070
This means to help.

127
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,690
And I would say lend is possibly

128
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,080
more common in British English.

129
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,913
Can you give me a hand?

130
00:05:57,913 --> 00:05:59,280
Can you lend me a hand?

131
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,400
Give me, or lend me, lend me.

132
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,270
Can you lend me a hand?

133
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,980
An example, if you need
any help with moving,

134
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,500
I can lend a hand.

135
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,330
Number nine, head.

136
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,340
To have one's head in the clouds.

137
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,600
This means to be unaware or
unrealistic about something,

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,960
to be naive.

139
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,050
An example, he has his head in the clouds,

140
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,210
if he thinks he's getting
a pay rise in this economy.

141
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,500
Number 10, head and feet here.

142
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,700
We have head over heels.

143
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,560
Head over heels.

144
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,320
To fall head over heels
in love with somebody.

145
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,010
Head over heels means deeply
or completely in love.

146
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,070
An example, she is head over
heels with her new puppy.

147
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,750
She's completely in
love with her new puppy.

148
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,330
Number 11, head again, in over one's head.

149
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,640
To be in over one's head.

150
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,670
This means that you're taking on a task

151
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,200
that you can't handle.

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,310
An example, I am
completely in over my head

153
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,180
in my new teaching position.

154
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,410
Number 12 is eyes.

155
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,750
To keep an eye on.

156
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,200
To keep an eye on something or someone.

157
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,480
This means to watch or monitor
normally in a protective way.

158
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,970
To keep something safe.

159
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,330
An example, can you keep an eye on my bike

160
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,850
whilst I nip into the post office?

161
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,120
To nip somewhere, is to
go somewhere very briefly.

162
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,650
To nip into, to go into very briefly.

163
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,250
I'm just going to nip to the shops.

164
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,380
I'm just going to very
quickly go to the shops.

165
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,730
Number 13, chin.

166
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,190
To keep one's chin up.

167
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,340
To keep one's chin up.

168
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,600
This means to try to be cheerful

169
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,290
or to try to avoid being sad.

170
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,470
An example, keep your chin up,

171
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,810
exam season will be over soon.

172
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,770
Number 14, is to learn
or to know off by heart.

173
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,020
You don't always have to include the off,

174
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,020
that's quite common in British English.

175
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,040
To learn by heart, to know off by heart.

176
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,560
This means to memorise.

177
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,340
An example, I know the Harry
Potter books off by heart,

178
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,240
all seven of them.

179
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,890
Number 15, we're onto hair.

180
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,950
This is to let one's hair down.

181
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,650
To let one's hair down.

182
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,000
Which means to relax or to have fun.

183
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,620
Let your hair down, relax,
have fun enjoy yourself.

184
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,970
This is usually said to somebody

185
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,560
who's a little more serious.

186
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,950
An example, she needs
to let her hair down.

187
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,510
She is always so stressed.

188
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,180
Number 16, lips.

189
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,750
My lips are sealed.

190
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,890
My lips are sealed and this means

191
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,700
your secret is safe with me.

192
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,650
An example, my lips are sealed,

193
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,970
I have no idea how much your dress cost.

194
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,240
Number 17, blood.

195
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
I don't know where to point
all over my body hopefully.

196
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,560
It is makes my blood boil.

197
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,270
If something makes your blood boil,

198
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,860
it makes you really really angry.

199
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,310
An example, the way that
they have underpaid you

200
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,310
and mistreated you over all
these years makes my blood boil.

201
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,010
Number 18, the body as a whole.

202
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,800
Over my dead body.

203
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,620
Over my dead body.

204
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,800
This is something that
said, when you want to say,

205
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,110
you cannot do that until I am dead,

206
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,670
and then I can't stop you.

207
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,820
An example, over my dead body,

208
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,770
I will never let you drive my car.

209
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,080
You'll have to wait til I die
before you can drive my car.

210
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
Number 19, Back.

211
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,640
A pat on the back.

212
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,610
A pat on the back.

213
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,030
And this means a thank you or recognition.

214
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,100
An example, I think I
deserve a pat on the back

215
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,063
after all of my hard work today.

216
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,550
You will often see people
doing a little meaning,

217
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,950
oh pat on the back, I've done really well.

218
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,300
Well done me (laughs).

219
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,800
Number 20, back to those
wonderful ears again.

220
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,120
To play something by ear.

221
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,980
This means to do something without a plan.

222
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,090
An example, I don't know if the weather

223
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,730
will be dry enough for a picnic.

224
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,130
Let's play it by ear.

225
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,170
Let's not have a plan, we'll just decide

226
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,650
if it's nice weather later on
today, we'll have the picnic.

227
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:02,120
If not, then we'll have the picnic inside

228
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,270
and living in Britain with
very unpredictable weather.

229
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,250
I have had many, a picnic inside before.

230
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,150
Number 21, back to legs.

231
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,790
It is to pull one's leg.

232
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,680
To pull someone's leg.

233
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,900
This means to joke or to tease someone.

234
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,400
For example, are you pulling my leg?

235
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,870
Are you really moving away?

236
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,203
Don't pull my leg.

237
00:10:24,084 --> 00:10:25,380
Is she pulling my leg?

238
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,840
Number 22, thumb.

239
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,090
The rule of thumb or a rule of thumb.

240
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,900
This means a general basic
rule, that's not always true,

241
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,460
but it's generally true.

242
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,680
An example, as a rule of
thumb, a cup of coffee

243
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,130
generally contains 80
milligrammes of caffeine.

244
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,310
Number 23, eyes.

245
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,290
To see eye to eye.

246
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,910
To see eye to eye.

247
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,400
This means to agree on something.

248
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,450
So if you say we don't see
eye to eye, we don't agree.

249
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:57,270
For example, her parents
didn't see eye to eye

250
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,340
on her education.

251
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,010
Number 24, back to teeth.

252
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,100
We have sweet tooth, a sweet tooth.

253
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,030
And this means a love of sweet things.

254
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,940
Can you tell me if that's
the same in your language?

255
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,570
If English isn't your first language,

256
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,750
I'd be very interested.

257
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,940
Do you have a sweet tooth,

258
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,020
direct translation or something different?

259
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,510
My grandma has the biggest
sweet tooth on earth.

260
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,100
And here's your example,

261
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,350
my grandma once requested a birthday meal

262
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,250
consisting of just puddings.

263
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,570
She has such a sweet tooth.

264
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,860
And number 25 back to hands.

265
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,900
It is to wash one's hands of something.

266
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,207
To wash your hands of something.

267
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:41,320
And this means to stop dealing
with an issue or a problem.

268
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,620
I'm going to wash my hands of it.

269
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm not gonna deal with it anymore,

270
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,480
not my problem.

271
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,170
An example, I'm going
to wash my hands of him.

272
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,140
He causes too many problems.

273
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,180
Right, that is it for today's lesson,

274
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,160
I hope you enjoyed it.

275
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,360
I hope you learned something.

(gentle music)
