00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:01,930
Welcome back to JForrest English.

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:02,930
I'm Jennifer.

3
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:09,200
And today we're going to read a news article
together an advanced news article so you can

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,940
learn all of the natural Expressions, Advanced
vocabulary, and complex, grammar naturally

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,720
and easily.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,010
Let's get started, our headline nice and short
life on Mars.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,699
A very interesting topic, a new study published
in the journal science,

8
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,730
Shows definitive evidence of organic matter
on the surface of Mars, organic matter, simply

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,390
means living matter matter.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,980
That is living.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,251
For example, in this picture, it looks like
there's some green when you see green, you

12
00:00:45,251 --> 00:00:46,251
think plants.

13
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:49,530
So it looks like living matter, organic matter.

14
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,829
Now, let's take a look at this shows, evidence
shows definitive evidence.

15
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,719
When I See This I say, wow definitive evidence.

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,010
Definitive is an adjective.

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,840
That means firm, final or complete.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,550
So this evidence is firm its final.

19
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,550
You can think of it as

20
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,550
not

21
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:11,550
to be questioned.

22
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:14,310
So you can't question this evidence.

23
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,970
It's firm and final.

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,610
So real evidence, it makes it a lot

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,070
stronger

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,340
of organic matter, on the surface of Mars.

27
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,401
Now, notice here, we have the journal science
and you see those science has a cap.

28
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:37,610
Capital S, this is because it's a proper noun,
and you need to capitalize the first letter

29
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,140
of a proper noun, proper noun,

30
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,020
and as a proper noun because the name of the
journal is science, that's why it has a capital

31
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,549
S. But if you were just talking about this
subject science, I love science.

32
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,719
Class, you don't need to capitalize it because
in this case it's not a proper noun.

33
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,719
The

34
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,530
Otto was collected by NASA's nuclear-powered
rover Curiosity again.

35
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:11,890
This is a great example, curiosity, which
you probably know as a noun curiosity is a

36
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,330
good thing when you're a student.

37
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,120
But in this case, it's the name of the Rover.

38
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,750
The name of the Rover is curiosity and that's
why we have a capital first letter.

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,730
It's a proper noun, it confirms the Rover.

40
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,830
Citee confirms earlier findings that the red
planet once contained.

41
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,670
Carbon based compounds, I'll be honest with
you, I'm not exactly sure what a carbon-based

42
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,000
compound is.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,100
It's a compound that contains carbon, that's
all I know about that.

44
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:54,069
Red planet is another name for the planet
Mars because it is red.

45
00:02:54,069 --> 00:03:01,470
So, when you see red planet, you know, they're
talking about Mars,

46
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,130
These compounds, they're talking about the
carbon based compounds.

47
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:13,360
Also called organic molecules are essential
ingredients for life as scientists understand

48
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
it.

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,379
Now notice how they explain what these compounds
are, or why they're important because the

50
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,379
average

51
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:21,379
person

52
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:27,519
like me who doesn't have a scientific background
has no idea what a carbon-based compound is.

53
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,000
So they explain what this is.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So now I know

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,459
Essential meaning very important extremely
important.

58
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:45,610
Important and not just important very important.

59
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,210
Essential ingredients for life as scientists
understand it.

60
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:56,520
So now I know you can't have life without
these carbon-based compounds and they have

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,460
found definitive evidence that these compounds
exist on Mars.

62
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:06,210
The red planet, essentially saying that life
on Mars is possible.

63
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:12,310
I've summarized all of the lesson notes and
you can find them in our free lesson PDF,

64
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,349
you can look for the link in the description.

65
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:22,460
Are in the first comment, let's continue the
organic molecules were found in Mars's Gale

66
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:32,340
crater a large area that may have been a watery
Lake over 3 billion years ago, the Rover encountered,

67
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:39,650
traces of the molecule in rocks, extracted
from the area, when you extract something,

68
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,210
it means you remove it or take it out.

69
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,590
So they have a raw

70
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,590
Rock.

71
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,910
And within this rock, there are molecules,
so they took those molecules out.

72
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,020
They extracted it.

73
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,400
This is also the terminology you use.

74
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,160
If you need to get a tooth removed, you

75
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,160
can

76
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,020
extract a tooth, which means simply to remove
it.

77
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:12,820
So, to remove or take out to remove or take
out and you remove something generally from

78
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,820
something else.

79
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,820
So, you

80
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,590
Act the molecules from The Rock.

81
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:27,509
The Rocks, also contain sulfur, which scientists
speculate helped preserve the Organics even

82
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:33,160
when the Rocks were exposed to the harsh,
radiation on the surface of the planet.

83
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,680
Remember, we're talking about the planet Mars.

84
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,430
Now, let's take a look at this verb.

85
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,030
Speculate a very common verb,

86
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:54,250
When you speculate on something, it means
you essentially guess what the answer is and

87
00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,810
you do that because you don't have enough
information to be certain if you're certain,

88
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,470
it means you 100%.

89
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,470
No.

90
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:10,030
So you can present that information as a fact,
but if you're just guessing you use the verbs

91
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,310
speculate.

92
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,979
So when your audience here, speculate that

93
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:22,849
They know that you are not 100% certain you
are in fact guessing so scientists speculate

94
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,180
so they don't actually know that this is 100%
correct.

95
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,930
It's their best guest based on the information
they have scientists speculate helped preserve

96
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,050
the Organics even that when the Rocks were
exposed to the harsh

97
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,050
radiation.

98
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,050
Let's take a look at harsh.

99
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,199
Harsh is an adjective.

100
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:53,060
So, I could say exposed to the radiation,
which means the radiation affected it.

101
00:06:53,060 --> 00:07:02,770
It was in the same area as the radiation,
so it was exposed to the radiation to the

102
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,800
harsh radiation.

103
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,280
So harsh is an adjective.

104
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:14,000
That modifies radiation, and harsh means unpleasant,
unkind cruel.

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,350
More severe than necessary.

106
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:24,780
So radiation is very strong and they're saying
that this radiation was very severe, perhaps

107
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:35,940
more severe than it, usually is the harsh
radiation on the surface of the planet.

108
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,819
Let's move on.

109
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:44,039
Scientists are quick to state that the presence
of these organic molecules is not sufficient

110
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:52,990
evidence for ancient Life on Mars as the molecules
could have been formed by non living processes.

111
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,710
So here, they're casting some doubt Incheon
Life on Mars.

112
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:05,550
So, they're saying right now, we don't have
enough evidence to say that previously,

113
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,070
In ancient times, there was Life on Mars so
that would be ancient life.

114
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:19,680
So not sufficient is saying we don't have
enough evidence not sufficient, so not enough

115
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,680
not

116
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,990
enough to be convincing not enough.

117
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:28,849
And in this case to convince

118
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:36,409
You could say, I don't have sufficient time
so in that case is not enough time to do something.

119
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,279
I don't have sufficient time to complete this
article.

120
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:47,279
I don't have enough time to do it.

121
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,580
So the scientists are suggesting, there could
be another reason why these molecules are

122
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,130
there.

123
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:06,050
But it's still one of the most astonishing
discoveries, which could lead to Future Revelations.

124
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,130
Let's take a look at astonishment as an adjective.

125
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,480
This means surprising or it can be amazing.

126
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,620
That was astonishing that was amazing, but
maybe it was that was astonishing.

127
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,251
It was surprising at the same time, so it
depends on how it's being used in this.

128
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:32,160
This case, it could be really either the most
astonishing discoveries which could lead to

129
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,020
Future Revelations.

130
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:42,710
Let's look at Revelation in this case, it's
a noun, it comes from the verb reveal.

131
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,170
So when you reveal something, you make that
information known.

132
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:55,330
It's the same case as all Revelation a revelation
is when a fact becomes known.

133
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,579
Now it can be

134
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,050
When a unknown

135
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,120
fact

136
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,270
becomes known.

137
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,959
So before we didn't know it and now we know
it, it's a revelation or it can be when a

138
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,070
secret fact becomes known.

139
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,330
So certain people knew it but the general
public didn't not.

140
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:24,440
So when the general public found out what
a revelation, remember this comes from the

141
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,130
verb to reveal.

142
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:33,320
You and you reveal a secret which means you
share a secret that you previously had not

143
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:42,389
shared especially when one considers the other
startling fine that Curiosity uncovered around

144
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:43,959
5 years ago.

145
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:51,139
Remember curiosity is the name of NASA's rover
which is the machine that operates on the

146
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:53,900
surface of the planet Mars.

147
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,069
Now let's look at startling as an

148
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:59,070
- a startling fine.

149
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,470
When something is startling.

150
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:09,029
It's surprising but usually in a worrisome
way.

151
00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:14,560
So you could say, I went to the doctor and
I got some startling news that doesn't sound

152
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:21,600
very good because it's news that surprised
you but generally in a negative way, in a

153
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,209
worrisome way.

154
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,320
So especially when one considers the

155
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,800
The other startling find that Curiosity uncovered
around 5 years ago.

156
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,770
So we'll find out what that startling find
is that surprising fine but somehow in some

157
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,770
sort of a

158
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,770
negative

159
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:47,170
way perhaps a worrisome way the Rover analyzes
the air around it.

160
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:54,209
Periodically periodically is an adverb that
means from time to time periodically from

161
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:56,950
time to time.

162
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:07,100
So, consistently means all the time, but periodically
means perhaps once a week, or once a day,

163
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,540
so on a schedule, but not all the time, which
would be consistently.

164
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,940
Are you enjoying this lesson?

165
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,940
If you are?

166
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Then I want to tell you about the finally
fluent Academy.

167
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:26,199
This is my premium training program, where
we study native English speakers on TV movies.

168
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:30,050
He's YouTube and the news so you can improve

natural fun, engaging way and you'll have

171
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,070
me as your personal coach so you can look
in the description or the comment section

172
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,540
for more information on how to join.

173
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:56,510
Now, let's continue on and in 2014, it Rover,
it found that

174
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:03,360
Are contained another of the most basic organic
molecules, and a key ingredient of natural,

175
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,940
gas methane.

176
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,050
So the Rover found another molecule on the
planet.

177
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,600
Mars methane, one of the characteristics.

178
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,529
A methane is that it only survives a few

179
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:20,529
hundred

180
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:21,529
years.

181
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:23,710
So, a few hundred to me.

182
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,710
That sounds like

183
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:35,279
Jared, maybe 400 maybe 500 because a few is
more than 2 because 2 is a couple a couple

184
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:43,230
hundred years is too and few is generally
more than 2 but less than definitely less

185
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,450
than 10 325.

186
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,630
I would say a few hundred years.

187
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:52,990
This means that something somewhere on Mars
is replenishing.

188
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,240
The supply when something is real

189
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,720
One ish, it means it's filled up again.

190
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:10,329
So for example, if a lake had water and then
there was a drought, very dry conditions and

191
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:13,410
all the water evaporated.

192
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:19,970
So if you put more water in that Lake, your
replenishing, the lake.

193
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:22,180
You're filling the lake again.

194
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,750
So there are saying that something on the

195
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,750
Planet.

196
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,230
Mars is replenishing.

197
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:37,269
The supply of methane, which could be the
startling, find it.

198
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:38,269
Surprising.

199
00:14:38,269 --> 00:14:41,410
And maybe there's reason to be concerned.

200
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,410
What is this?

201
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,410
That's replenishing.

202
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,410
The supply.

203
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,779
How is it doing this?

204
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,410
What does it mean for us on earth?

205
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:52,509
That could be the startling part

206
00:14:52,509 --> 00:15:01,490
According to NASA, Mars immense thousands
of tons of methane at a time.

207
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,490
The verb.

208
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:12,709
Mm, it simply means to to produce or to send
out to produce.

209
00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:18,079
Or send out, but we use this in very specific
cases.

210
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,899
We use it with gases.

211
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:23,630
In this case, we also use this with sounds
sounds.

212
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:31,050
So the, the truck emits, a lot of gas for
one.

213
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,900
And a lot of noise.

214
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,589
Oh, the sound that that truck is emitting,
or the building is emitting.

215
00:15:37,589 --> 00:15:41,209
It's really hurting my ears.

216
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,740
We also use this.

217
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,199
S4 light.

218
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:51,310
So the airport emits, a lot of light, its
blinding Mars, immense, thousands of tons

219
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:59,709
of methane at a time, the level of methane
Rises and Falls as seasonal intervals in the

220
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:00,709
year.

221
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:06,810
Almost as if the planet is breathing, it sounds
a little strange.

222
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,970
Perhaps, that's the startling information
here.

223
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:20,500
NASA specs, the methane comes from deep under
the surface of the planet, the variations

224
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:27,740
in temperature on the surface of Mars, cause
the molecule, which is methane to flow upwards

225
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,670
at higher or lower levels.

226
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,670
Okay?

227
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:39,990
So this is the, scientists are speculating
because if you suspect something,

228
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,191
you don't know for sure.

229
00:16:41,191 --> 00:16:49,631
I'm sure otherwise you would say NASA knows
the methane comes but they suspect, which

230
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:54,030
means they're about, 80% sure they're guessing.

231
00:16:54,030 --> 00:17:02,870
So again, you could also use the verb speculate,
NASA speculates, the methane comes from deep

232
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:06,430
under the surface so they don't know.

233
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:10,960
100%, for example, in the winter, the gas
could get trapped

234
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Underground.

235
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,579
I see crystals.

236
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:19,050
Okay, so, this is what's happening to the
methane.

237
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,789
These crystals called clathrates melt in the
summer and release the gas.

238
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:32,660
So, this is their theory on how this gas is
being released at different times of the year

239
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,780
in winter.

240
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,200
It's frozen.

241
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,110
The gas is Frozen in these icy crystals, but
in summer when these

242
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,490
Crystals melt, they release the methane.

243
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,220
Again, this is not a fact because there are
speculating they suspect.

244
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,660
This is what is happening.

245
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,059
They don't know it to be true.

246
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:00,820
However, the source of the methane is still
a complete mystery.

247
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:08,770
Complete is an adjective and it means very
great or the highest

248
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,530
possible.

249
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,380
So we're seeing it's a mystery, but not just
a mystery.

250
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:23,960
Imagine the greatest mystery you've ever thought
of, that's a complete mystery, it's a very

251
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,179
great mystery, the highest mystery possible.

252
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,700
It's a complete mystery.

253
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,570
So the source meaning, how the methane is
there originally?

254
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,200
Where does the methane come from?

255
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
That is a

256
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,169
Complete mystery, the world of astrobiology
considers.

257
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:52,480
Both of these studies, a historical milestone.

258
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,799
A milestone is an important event and it's
an important event in history, or in your

259
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,400
life as well.

260
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,250
An important event in history or one's life.

261
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:15,179
For example, one of the big Milestones is,
when you graduate from school, that's a milestone.

262
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,120
That's an important event in your life.

263
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,480
When you graduate, when you get married, when
you get your first job when you have a baby,

264
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,700
E, you buy your first car, buy your first
house, these are all Milestones, but of course,

265
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,760
there are also historical milestones.

266
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:37,809
And this, the information found in these studies
is one of those Milestones.

267
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:42,490
According to this information, Mars is not
a dead Planet.

268
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,380
So of course, a dead Planet would be a planet
that cannot sustain life.

269
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,860
On the contrary we use this as a transition
word.

270
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:56,880
We want to introduce a contrasting point.

271
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,490
So, dead planet is the one point.

272
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:07,280
Now, the contrasting point would have to show
something with life and we can use on the

273
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,580
contrary Mars is not a dead planet on the
contrary.

274
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:19,830
It is quite active with life, with molecules
with organic matter and maybe changing and

275
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,830
becoming more

276
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:28,950
Edible, if you describe something as habitable,
it means you're able to live there because

277
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,360
the conditions are appropriate.

278
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:42,500
So able to live there, for example, a very,
very old house that has a lot of damage might

279
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,830
not be habitable is not suitable to live there.

280
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,080
You're not able to live there or after a flood
or not.

281
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Cyril disaster.

282
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,580
Maybe your home is no longer habitable.

283
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,679
Of course this means.

284
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,710
Further research is necessary.

285
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,850
Scientists say they need to send new equipment
to Mars equipment that can measure the air

286
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,610
and soil with more Precision.

287
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:16,130
More Precision, is another way of saying,
more accuracy accuracy, they need to be more

288
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,070
accurate.

289
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,960
There are already missions.

290
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,799
Underway underway means they're in progress.

291
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,450
Now in progress now,

292
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,450
In progress.

293
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:37,400
Now the European space agency's exomars ship
lands in 2020 and will be able to drill into

294
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,960
the ground on Mars to analyze what it finds.

295
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:49,039
Additionally, NASA is sending another Mars
Rover in the same year to collect samples

296
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,230
of Martian, soil and return them to Earth.

297
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,570
So,

298
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:55,909
Martian.

299
00:21:55,909 --> 00:21:59,800
This comes from the word Mars.

300
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,420
Just like, if you live in Italy, you're an
Italian.

301
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:07,549
If you live on Mars, you're a martian.

302
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,320
That can be something you can maybe look forward
to.

303
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:21,510
So live on Mars equals Martian, Martian soil,
Italian wine, Pizza tomatoes.

304
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:24,630
For example, Martian soil,

305
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:32,549
And notice how Mars Martian Earth also have
that Capital first letter because they are

306
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:33,680
proper nouns.

307
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,669
Remember, we talked about proper nouns at
the beginning.

308
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:37,669
Proper nouns.

309
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:45,470
So you need Capital first letter and here
NASA is in all capitals because we also capitalize

310
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,590
acronyms.

311
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:53,640
So each letter stands for something to be
honest, I don't know what NASA stands for.

312
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
I

313
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,039
The essay is space agency.

314
00:22:58,039 --> 00:23:04,850
National, what's the a Association space agency?

315
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:06,419
That doesn't sound right?

316
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,529
What is the acronym for NASA?

317
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:13,240
Do, you know, put it in the comments because
honestly, I'm not sure, I'm pretty sure essay

318
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:19,309
is space agency, but I don't know what the
n and the A stand for because nobody ever

319
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,510
says it.

320
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,630
Everybody says NASA.

321
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,059
Let's continue again.

322
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,700
Let me know in the comments.

323
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,820
The possibility of Life on Mars has fascinated
humans for Generations.

324
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:37,490
It has been the subject of endless science
fiction, novels and films.

325
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:42,320
If you describe something as endless it means
again and again and again.

326
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,480
So how's you know, there are always movies
and books about aliens.

327
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,120
Martians life on other planets, right?

328
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,330
So again and again and again non-ending.

329
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:03,119
Again, and again, non-ending endless.

330
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,580
Are we alone in the universe?

331
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,640
Ooh.

332
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:14,340
Or have there been other life forms within
our solar system if the current missions to

333
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,070
the red planet?

334
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:21,820
Which again means Mars Mars.

335
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,510
If the current missions to the red planet
continue.

336
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,740
It looks as if

337
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,260
we may discover the answer very soon.

338
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,380
Wow.

339
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:38,060
Isn't that a interesting way to end an article?

340
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,549
So that's our article on Mars.

341
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:45,429
Now I will go back and I'll read the article
from start to finish and this time you can

342
00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:50,270
focus on my pronunciation Life on Mars.

343
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:58,070
A new study published in the journal science
shows definitive evidence of organic matter

344
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,630
on the surface of Mars.

345
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:08,750
The data was collected by NASA's nuclear-powered
rover, Curiosity it confirms earlier findings

346
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:16,250
that the red planet once contain carbon based
compounds, these compounds also called organic

347
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,159
molecules are essential ingredients for life
as

348
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,590
as scientists understand it.

349
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:31,220
The organic molecules were found in Mars's
Gail cater a large area that may have been

350
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,630
a watery link.

351
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:40,420
Over 3 billion years ago, the Rover encountered,
traces of the molecule in rocks, extracted

352
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,520
from the area.

353
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:49,140
The wrongs also contains sulfur, which scientists
speculate helped preserve the Organics even

354
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,000
when the Rocks were exposed to the harsh radiation.

355
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:59,200
On the surface of the planet, scientists are
quick to state that the presence of these

356
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:06,289
organic molecules is not sufficient evidence
for ancient Life on Mars as the molecules,

357
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:13,610
could have been formed by non-living processes,
but it's still one of the most astonishing

358
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:19,730
discoveries which could lead to Future Revelations.

359
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:26,070
Especially when one considers the other startling
find that Curiosity, uncovered around five

360
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:34,260
years ago, the Rover, analyzes the air around
it, periodically, and in 2014, it found the

361
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,340
air contained.

362
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:44,159
Another of the most basic organic molecules
and a key ingredient of natural, gas methane.

363
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,960
One of the characteristics of methane is that
it only survives a

364
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,080
200 years.

365
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,280
This means that something somewhere on Mars
is replenishing the supply.

366
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:04,100
According to NASA, Mars immense, thousands
of tons of methane at a time, this level of

367
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:09,480
methane, Rises and falls at seasonal intervals
in the year.

368
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:15,910
Almost as if the planet is breathing it NASA
specs, the methane comes from deep under the

369
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,990
surface of the planet.

370
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,990
The very

371
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:25,059
Patience in temperature on the surface of
Mars, cause the molecule to flow upwards at

372
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:28,330
higher and higher levels.

373
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,360
For example, in the winter, the gas could
get trapped in underground.

374
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,040
I see crystals these crystals called clathrates
melt in the summer and release the gas.

375
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:45,260
However, the source of the methane is still
a complete mystery.

376
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:48,081
The world of astrobiology, considers both,

377
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:52,260
Both of these studies as historical Milestones.

378
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,370
According to this information, Mars is not
a dead planet.

379
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,830
On the contrary.

380
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,990
It is quite active and maybe changing and
becoming more habitable.

381
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:08,830
Of course, this means further research is
necessary.

382
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:14,149
Scientists say they need to send new equipment
to Mars equipment that can measure the air

383
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:17,240
and soil with more Precision.

384
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
There are already

385
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,130
Missions under way the European space.

386
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:30,120
Agency's exomars ship lands in 2020 and will
be able to drill into the ground on Mars to

387
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,710
analyze what it finds.

388
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:38,549
Additionally, NASA is sending another Mars
Rover in the same year to collect samples

389
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:45,590
of Martian soil and return them to Earth the
possibility of Life on Mars has fascinated

390
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,850
humans for Generations.

391
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,850
It has

392
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:52,820
on the subject of endless science fiction,
novels and films.

393
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:59,340
Are we alone in the universe or have there
been other life forms within our solar system

394
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,080
if the current missions to the red planet
continue?

395
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,649
It looks as if we may discover the answer
very soon if you like this lesson then make
