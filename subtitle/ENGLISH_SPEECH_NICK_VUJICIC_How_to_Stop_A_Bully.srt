1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
How you guys doing? Good, good good good good.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,770
Well guys, I was born this way, and there’s
no medical reason why that happened. My brother

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,910
and my sister were born with arms and legs.

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,650
And sometimes in life, things happen that
don’t make sense. My doctors never thought

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,980
that I’d be able to walk, and today, I’m
walking. I’m from Australia, anybody want

6
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:43,850
to one day go to Australia? It’s such a
cool place. And I now live in LA; I’m a

7
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,440
Southern California boy. So I only live about
four hours from here.

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,410
And today I’m going to tell you, man — I
love freaking people out. One day I’m in

9
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,399
a car, I’m in the front seat — I’m not
driving of course. Can you imagine if I’m

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,010
driving a car? They reckon they can put a
joystick — that thing that controlls my

11
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,790
wheelchair — we can put that in a car. Like
how fully sick is that? Imagine if I get pulled

12
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:14,700
over by the cops? Can I have your driver’s
license please? Yeah, but, it’s over there;

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,040
you’re going to have to get it.

14
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:27,070
Imagine if I’m in big trouble! Put your
hands up! Uhhhh.. Get out of your car! Uhhhhh…

15
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,600
So I’m in the front passenger’s seat,
we’re at the traffic lights, and this car

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,299
comes up next to us and this girl’s looking
at me. And I’m looking at her, she’s looking

17
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:41,380
at me, I’m looking at her, she’s looking
at me, I’m looking at her. All she sees

18
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,810
is my head, right? She has no idea that I
have no arms and no legs. So I’m thinking,

19
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,310
cool. I’m going to freak you out.

20
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,710
So I get the seatbelt in my mouth, and I loosen
it like this, so that I can freely move. And

21
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:07,159
she’s looking at me like “why are you
eating your seatbelt?’ So I pull it, the

22
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,810
belt is loose, I can move.

23
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,590
Now she’s looking at me, full 100% attention
and focus. And just imagine all you see is

24
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,340
my head, all right? You might want to put
up your hand to your face to cut off the rest

25
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,110
of my body. So you can really see the effect,
so…That’s it, exactly.

26
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:48,200
Here we go, ready? I just did this. And her
face, man. She was like — she nearly ran

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,730
the red light, man. It was so good.

28
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,130
My parents always said, Nick, you don’t
know what you can achieve until you try it.

29
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,860
And the doctors looked at me and said, he’s
not going to walk, he’s not going to go

30
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,210
to school, he’s not going to do anything
in his life.

31
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:11,900
And then my parents; they just loved me like
crazy, and said you’ve got to try. Try this,

32
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:17,379
try that, try this, try that, and I’m thinking
sometimes, like, Mom and Dad, you’re crazy,

33
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:22,370
I have no arms and no legs. How would I ever
be able to do this or do that?

34
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,300
But they encouraged me, and they loved me.
And as human beings, we’re waiting for stuff

35
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:35,700
like that, we all want love. Everybody say
it — loooooove. Very good.

36
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,230
We all want love. I went to school, and I
wanted to be cool, you know. You go to school

37
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:49,010
and you want to be accepted. So, you see these
guys, and you’re like, oh man, you know?

38
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:54,330
Everyone swears, like every third sentence.
F this, and F that, and F’n this, and F

39
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,349
F, like, what, they think they’re cool,
you know. And so I’m thinking, maybe I need

40
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:03,130
to be like them to be cool.

41
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,549
And then you compare each other with how we
look and I wish I was smarter, I wish I was

42
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,849
taller, I wish I was shorter, I wish I was
more popular, I wish I did this, I wish I

43
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:18,970
didn’t have that. I wish my life was different.
That was me when I was about 8 years old;

44
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,200
I looked at myself, and I looked at everybody
else, and everyone else had more than me.

45
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:32,910
And I’m asking, why? Why me? Have you ever
asked the why me questions, but get nowhere?

46
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,009
If I had no answers from the doctors, and
if I had no answers from my parents, I still

47
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:43,581
have a choice, every day in my life, to keep
going or give up. You see this book up here?

48
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:49,490
This is my favorite book in the whole wide
world. This is my favorite book, the bible.

49
00:04:49,490 --> 00:05:03,350
And here I am – and here I am, and for me,
that’s my full potential in all that I can

50
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,880
be here on earth. And so encouragement takes
me closer to all that I can be, and discouragement

51
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,639
takes me away.

52
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:16,280
You see, it only takes three seconds for someone
to tease me when I was at school, and just

53
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:24,240
say ewwwww, you’re ugly. Ewww, you can’t
do this and you can’t do that. Some of you

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,590
are thinking, like, man, seriously? You had
kids picking on you? How heartless are those

55
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,630
kids? Picking on me with no limbs? You would
probably say, well, I’m not that bad. I

56
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,300
wouldn’t pick on a kid with no limbs. But
why would you pick on anyone? Well, because

57
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,960
it’s fun, it’s just culture. OK, we’ll
get to that.

58
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,139
But for me, facing all that stuff? I’m getting
these seeds, everyone say seeds, S-E-E-D-S,

59
00:05:52,139 --> 00:06:01,340
seeds. Have you seen the pictures of the sequoia
reds up here in California? These huge trees.

60
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,660
Like some of the trunks could be nearly as
big as this room. I’ve seen those photos

61
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,280
where they’ve actually dug out a tunnel
in a trunk of a tree — you can drive a full-size

62
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,970
SUV right through it. That all started with
a little seed.

63
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:24,370
If you leave a seed of lies in your heart
and in your mind, and you don’t know the

64
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:31,509
truth? If you don’t know the truth, you
will die with the lie. I started dying, because

65
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,690
I started believing what I was told.

66
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,550
I want you to know the three things that I
needed to come to in my life is the truth

67
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:46,910
of my values, the truth of my purpose, and
the truth of my destiny. I want you to know

68
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:53,480
something. In our mind, we put ourselves down
all the time. I want to ask you today, do

69
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:00,990
you think I’m cool enough to be your friend?
But I don’t swear, I don’t use the F-bomb,

70
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,630
am I still cool enough to be your friend?
But I don’t tease people, am I still cool

71
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:20,210
enough to be your friend? But I have no arms
and no legs. Seriously.

72
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,360
You would be my friend, even though I have
no arms, no legs. So you’re telling me it

73
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:37,270
actually doesn’t matter, right? If it actually
doesn’t matter, for how we look, then why

74
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,840
do we tease one another for how we look if
it actually doesn’t matter? Why is it that

75
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,790
we look ourselves in the mirror, and we say,
well, we’re having fun! Oh yeah, man it’s

76
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,199
just part of culture, man.

77
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:01,770
There were twelve people one day teased me.
Taking me away from my hope. 12, 11, 10, 9,

78
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:09,240
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Don’t worry, I won’t
fall off, because if I did, I’d break my

79
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,400
arm.

80
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:22,820
But twelve people teased me one day. And I
can put a pretty brave face on but cry on

81
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:30,639
the inside. For real. Oh, it doesn’t hurt!
Yeah, it hurts. There was this one bully,

82
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,159
I became his target for three weeks. And every
time I’d go by him — I was 13, he was

83
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:43,129
17. I was in my chair. I’m only 4’9″
in my other chair, my old chair. He’s like

84
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,690
6′ something, so he’s huge, right? So
I’m looking up at him, and every time I’d

85
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,630
go by him, he’s like, “Hey, there’s
Nick! He has no…” And you can imagine

86
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,080
what he said. And I’m like, what’s his
problem, man?

87
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,630
So I would try to avoid him, and I was so
embarrassed, because he would say it really

88
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:06,880
loud and everybody would be looking and some
would be laughing. I’m like, what is this

89
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:15,320
guy’s problem, man? So one day, after three
weeks, I went up to him and I said, “Hey”.

90
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,370
He’s like, “Hey”.

91
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,920
And I said, “Can you please stop it?”

92
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,019
He said, “Stop what?”

93
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,430
I said “Stop teasing me”.

94
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,690
He said, “What are you talking about?”

95
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,800
I said, “Every time I walk by you say that
stuff”.

96
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,200
He’s like, “What stuff?” He didn’t
know how to take me on.

97
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,420
So I’m looking up at him and said, “No
man. Every time I walk by, you say exactly

98
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,890
this, and I want you to stop. I forgive you,
but stop it”.

99
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,250
He’s like, “Oh, it’s not hurting you”.

100
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:53,010
Now, I could have said, “No,” or I could
have said yeah. It takes a level of humility

101
00:09:53,010 --> 00:10:06,590
to actually say, um, actually, I don’t like
that. It’s killing me. And I said, “Ah,

102
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,890
yeah, it’s hurting me”.

103
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,860
He said, “All right, I’m sorry man. I
was just, you know, playing around”.

104
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,390
I said, “Give me a hug”.

105
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,590
He said, “What?”

106
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,290
I said, “Give me a hug”.

107
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:29,790
He’s like, “All right”. So I gave him
a hug. I’m a hugging machine. We made the

108
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:36,550
Guinness Book of World Records: 1,749 hugs
in one year. We did it last year — my arms

109
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,720
fell off, all right? The scary thing about
hugging so many people is that anyone can

110
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,560
just pick me up and take me home. Like, what
am I going to do, like, –hit them or something?

111
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,010
Pretty mean head-butt, right?

112
00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:01,880
I want you to know that you might be playing
around. I can pretty much say that 98% of

113
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,510
you have teased someone in your life. I tried
to commit suicide because of people who thought

114
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:16,410
they were having fun, not knowing the hell
that I was going through. The people you’re

115
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:21,730
teasing — what if the person you’re teasing
is the person who’s thinking of committing

116
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,440
suicide.

117
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,291
What if the person you’re teasing is the
one who’s trying to commit suicide, who

118
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:38,459
hates their life because of you? You don’t
know if the person you are teasing is the

119
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:45,680
son or daughter of a drunk at home getting
abused. And all they need is someone like

120
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,850
you to keep on pushing them this way.

121
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:00,589
We need hope, so find something else to do.
Find positive things in your own life; I don’t

122
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:06,529
care about how you look, I will never ever
ever tease you. I will never tease you! I

123
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:12,400
could tease you, I could be tough. People
thinking that bullying is tough? It ain’t

124
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:19,269
tough! My wheelchair? This is tough. This
thing, man, I’ll tell you something — you

125
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:20,570
ready?

126
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:27,700
This wheelchair. This thing’s so tough.
When my friend built this for me, he said,

127
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:34,710
you’re going to love it. I said what, does
it go fast? He said no, but it’s tough.

128
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,190
And I said, well, what do you mean? He said,
you’ll find out.

129
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:46,519
The torque in these motors, at the bottom
at the back. This thing. If someone’s holding

130
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,700
it. I’m telling you, it can go 90 degrees.
I went 80 degrees up, alright? Someone’s

131
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,601
holding me to make sure I don’t tip back.
My wife, she loves shopping with me, because

132
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:02,620
she just jumps on the back, and we go shopping.
She just shops and shops, because she doesn’t

133
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,110
drop, right? We just go and do it; it’s
fun.

134
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,220
Now what I tried one day to do — you’ll
never believe me, maybe you will, just know

135
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,910
that every word that comes out of my mouth
is not an exaggeration.

136
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,120
One day, I needed to move a car. So I got
my wife to put my car, my ’66 Chevelle,

137
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:27,550
in neutral. It’s a two and a half ton car,
and I backed it back with this thing. Two

138
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:35,899
and a half — just this. Just like this,
like nothing. This thing is tough. Guess what?

139
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:42,329
The definition of tough means it’s strong.
To show your strength, you need to do something

140
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:48,410
that’s difficult. I would sound so stupid
if I said hey guys, I got a matchbox car one

141
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:54,089
day, and I got some fishing line, and I towed
that matchbox car all around all day. How

142
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:57,519
tough is my BMW? That’s stupid.

143
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,490
That’s the same thing with bullying. You
think you’re tough? You’re trying to show

144
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,810
your strength? That’s not your strength.
Let me come back in ten years and let me get

145
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,850
your three — anyone have a three year old
nephew? Anyone have a three year old nephew?

146
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:14,850
Cool. Put your hands down.

147
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,480
I will get any one of your three year old
nephews, bring them tomorrow night at where

148
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,310
I’m speaking, and we’re going to put them
up on stage, and let me show you how tough

149
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:27,649
I am. We’ll get your three year old nephew,
and we’ll put him up here, on the table,

150
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:36,130
and let me tease him. Let me show you how
tough I am. That’s what you are! I could

151
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:42,670
pick on you, you biggest bullies. I could
pick on anything you like. Any singer, any

152
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,120
music that you like. I could tease you, I
could tease your family, I could tease your

153
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,970
friends, I could tease about the movies you
think are really cool, I could tease anything

154
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,360
about you. I could tease you about your nose,
your eyes, your teeth, your chin, your hair,

155
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,079
your ears, your elbows, your knees, your whatever,
man! I can tease you about anything. It ain’t

156
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,990
hard, just like you can tease me.

157
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,490
You want to know what tough is? Go to the
people you tease, and say sorry. You want

158
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:19,180
to know what tough is, go up to the people
who still tease you, and say, hey. Stop it,

159
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,420
I forgive you, but please stop it. That’s
tough.

160
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,350
I want you to know something, the truth of
who you are. I don’t care what job you get.

161
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:33,620
I don’t care. I don’t care how smart you
are, everyone. I don’t care. I don’t care,

162
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:40,170
I love you and I believe in you. I don’t
care if you end up being a janitor in this

163
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:47,420
school, I’ll tell you why – because the
janitor in my high school inspired me to be

164
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:56,630
a speaker. He changed my life. He said, you
should be a speaker, you know, and I said,

165
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:01,560
you’re crazy! He said no really, you need
to be a speaker. I said, stop it man. Four

166
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,100
months later, he twisted my arm, and I said
yes. I spoke in front of ten people, then

167
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,699
another ten, then another ten, then I found
myself in front of 300 sophomore students.

168
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:16,579
And three minutes into my speech, half the
girls were crying, and one girl in the middle

169
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:21,070
of the room started weeping. She put up her
hand and said “I’m so sorry, can I come

170
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,070
up there and give you a hug.” And in front
of everybody, she came up and she hugged me,

171
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,290
and she cried on my shoulder, and she whispered
in this ear. Thank you, thank you, thank you,

172
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,100
no one’s ever told me that they love me.
No one’s ever told me that I’m beautiful

173
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,509
the way that I am.

174
00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:43,710
It was because my parents told me that I was
beautiful that I am still here. Some of you

175
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:50,529
don’t have those parents, and that’s why
I’m here. I love you and you’re beautiful

176
00:16:50,529 --> 00:17:03,430
just the way you are. Never, ever give up.

177
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:18,540
How many schools do you think that I spoke
to actually stopped bullying altogether? OK.

178
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:26,410
Whoever said one, you are correct. One school
out of 600, I got a letter from the headmaster,

179
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:34,350
and he said Nick, you forever changed our
school, blah blah blah. We haven’t seen

180
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:45,260
any bullies pick on anybody for eight months
straight. We don’t know what happened, but

181
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:52,799
in the best words that I can describe, there’s
just a new thought in the air that it just

182
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:03,630
ain’t cool anymore. It just ain’t cool.

183
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:13,520
I want to ask you: What are you going to do?
Are you going to continue on? At the risk

184
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:23,240
of knowing that in each section, this section,
right here, five people already tried to commit

185
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:37,590
suicide. That section there? Five people.
When you extrapolate it out? What if the person

186
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:50,780
you’re teasing is one of those and you have
no idea. Would you find something else to

187
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,160
do?

188
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:04,521
So, the change is up to you. If you want to
see more love in your school, be love. If

189
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:10,380
50% of the school come together and say you
know what, it just ain’t cool anymore the

190
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,460
people who think it’s still cool, every
time they look down upon you, I want you to

191
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:21,090
look up. I want you to imagine my face looking
at you. Because I’m telling you, everyone

192
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:27,750
you’re teasing is my brother and my sister.
And you’re my brother, and you’re my sister.

193
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:34,640
And I’m asking you to stop.

194
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,259
Love yourself a bit more, love each other
a lot more.
