1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,740
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,720
I've been getting lots of requests for lessons

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,060
that will help you to expand your vocabulary

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,600
and help you to sound more professional

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,420
when speaking in English.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,900
So that is exactly what this lesson is all about today.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,359
I'm going to take some very common

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,480
everyday English verbs and improve them a little

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,260
or give you some more impressive ones to use instead.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,400
So if you're ready to do that, stick around.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,300
I want to jump in with a quick message from our friends

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,960
at Lingoda to talk about their business English course

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,900
and the fact that they're offering mmmEnglish students

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,940
the chance to try their classes for free

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,280
which I'll tell you about soon.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,880
Anyone who studied business English will tell you

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,520
that it's quite different to general conversational English.

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,720
The language that we use at work tends to be more

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,220
formal so for anyone studying English to advance

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,260
their career, being able to communicate professionally

21
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,720
is going to help you to do that.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
Luckily at Lingoda, not only can you study French,

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,360
Spanish, German and of course, English classes,

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,119
they also have a specific business English course

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,660
and what I love about this is that you're studying

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,040
alongside other professionals

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,200
focusing on the English skills that you need

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,640
to communicate effectively in your workplace

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,500
like presentation skills and interview skills.

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,120
The skills that you need to help you progress

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,700
your career and to succeed in an international company.

32
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,920
Like all Lingoda courses, classes are available

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
twenty-four seven and in small groups.

34
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,380
When I was taking Spanish classes with Lingoda,

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,799
we usually had three or four students in each class

36
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,920
which was awesome! I had lots of speaking practice.

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,700
Business English classes with Lingoda will increase

38
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,300
your fluency and your confidence to use

39
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,680
English at work.

40
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,760
You can sign up for free for seven days

41
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,900
and try up to three group classes which is an

42
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,420
awesome way to see what the classes are like

43
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,440
before you decide to continue.

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,900
Or you can use this code down here and get

45
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,720
a fifteen per cent discount on your first month.

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,120
Use the link down in the description and definitely

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,220
go check them out.

48
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,780
Let's think for a moment about the many

49
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,160
basic functions that we do when we're at work.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,420
We think about things. We make things.

51
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,980
We change things. We guess.

52
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,120
We solve problems and we work together.

53
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,400
Now all of these words are good

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,260
and they will definitely help you to communicate

55
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,360
your message

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,160
but they're quite basic so if you want to

57
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,200
sound impressive, impress your boss

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,980
sound more professional with colleagues and clients

59
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,700
then upgrading these words will definitely help.

60
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,540
So let's start with the verb 'think'

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,580
specifically to think of or to think about something.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560
To think about attending an event

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,860
or asking for a raise.

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,820
Now we can upgrade this phrasal verb to 'consider'.

65
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,320
So instead of saying

66
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,260
I will think about your suggestion.

67
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,080
Say: I will consider your suggestion

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,360
but I need to find some extra budget before I approve it.

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,960
We can also upgrade

70
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,700
Have you thought about employing?

71
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,200
Have you considered employing a marketing

72
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,880
assistant in-house?

73
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,460
Now if you're thinking about something and the decision

74
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,480
is difficult for some reason, it's also important

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,220
then using 'deliberate' is a much better choice.

76
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,720
Deliberate.

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,500
So it's also a synonym of think about but it's used when

78
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
you're making a really tough decision

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,620
and you've got to take some extra time

80
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,240
to decide carefully.

81
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,600
You've been deliberating all week on this,

82
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,860
are you any closer to a decision?

83
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,880
We also have this idea of thinking something is...

84
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,520
I think Ben is one of the

85
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,980
best mentors in our organisation.

86
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,340
But we can improve this by using the verb 'believe'.

87
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,800
I believe

88
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,120
Ben is one of the best mentors in our organisation.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,900
So it sounds much surer, more confident and more

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,540
assertive.

91
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,240
We can also use 'consider' here as well

92
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,380
but the structure changes a little.

93
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,400
So I want you to pay close attention

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,540
to what changes in this sentence.

95
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,440
We can say: I think or I believe Ben is

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,040
but we can also say

97
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,520
I consider Ben to be one of the best mentors

98
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,160
in our organisation.

99
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,020
So when you use this language, it helps you to speak

100
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,200
with authority, to be more impressive, more confident.

101
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,660
It really sounds like you know what you're talking about.

102
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,160
Another really common verb to use at work is 'to make'

103
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,540
That's what we're there doing isn't it? We're making stuff

104
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,300
and there are lots of different words that we can use

105
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,780
instead of 'make'

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,500
but it really does depend on the context as to which one

107
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,800
you can use or you should use.

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
Let's take a look at this sentence and see

109
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
how we can improve it.

110
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,620
Our team made a report or wrote a report.

111
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,840
Can you think of a more professional verb

112
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,840
that you could use instead?

113
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,540
Should we prepare a report for the board?

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,000
Our team has already produced a detailed report.

115
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,340
So these words 'prepare' and 'produce'

116
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,340
are almost synonyms.

117
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,860
Prepare.

118
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,300
Prepare relates to the process, a little more.

119
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,960
And produce,

120
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,580
relates a little more to the result.

121
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,160
So we often see the collocation produce content,

122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,340
prepare a report.

123
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,820
These are useful ones to keep in mind.

124
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,440
'To create' is another verb upgrade on make right

125
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,440
especially when you're talking about

126
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,440
design or creative activities,

127
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,720
really when you're making something new you know.

128
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,320
We're creating a new concept for the client.

129
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,240
Can you create a new image that we can

130
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,800
share on social media?

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,500
We created a design that will suit a range of users.

132
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,760
'Develop' is another synonym for make,

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,480
kind of leans a little more towards the process.

134
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,200
Our technical team is developing a plan to transition

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,220
to our new platform by May.

136
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,120
Or even better, a strategy.

137
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,460
A strategy. They're developing a strategy.

138
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,880
We also develop ideas and we develop solutions.

139
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,100
We're developing an affordable solution that will make

140
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,500
sure every family can access high-speed internet.

141
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,360
So these are really important collocations

142
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,120
to keep in mind when you're using these verbs.

143
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,620
Often the idea of change can be perceived as negative,

144
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,240
people don't usually like change, do they?

145
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,240
Often we talk about change at work

146
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,540
because we need to fix something.

147
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,940
It suggests that there is something wrong

148
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,780
so in a professional context,

149
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,140
it's definitely important to make sure that you're polite

150
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,200
and that you're using language in a supportive way.

151
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,320
And I've got some alternative words and some useful

152
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,360
expressions that will help you with that.

153
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,760
And 'modify' is a really good alternative.

154
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,640
Modify.

155
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,960
Modify suggests minor changes,

156
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,180
tweaks and adjustments

157
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,780
and things that will improve the result.

158
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:30,400
Actually, you could also use the verb 'adjust'.

159
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,100
If it's okay with you, I'll adjust

160
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,320
this a little before we send it to the client.

161
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,479
Now when you're talking about changing ideas or

162
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,480
human behaviour, then 'adapt' is a really good choice

163
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
especially when there is a new situation or

164
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
a new set of circumstances that's behind that change.

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,519
Again, nobody really likes change do they but if you can

166
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,720
use a more positive verb to help talk about that change

167
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,220
then it's much easier to get other people on board right?

168
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,560
The new regulations are tough,

169
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,640
there's not much that we can do about it!

170
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,960
We just need to adapt and keep moving forward.

171
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,380
The word 'transition' is an excellent one to begin using

172
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,360
and to understand because it helps us to talk about

173
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,140
the need for change and the process of changing

174
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,940
in a comfortable way.

175
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,260
So if we transition from one thing to another,

176
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,320
it suggests that we sort of move carefully you know,

177
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,620
it's not instant change which usually scares people.

178
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,340
If we talk about transition, it suggests that the change

179
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,780
is going to be gradual and carefully considered.

180
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,140
We want to make sure that our new team members

181
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,500
transition into their new roles

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,400
as seamlessly as possible.

183
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
Although many of us try not to admit it,

184
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,480
we all guess what the heck is going on right,

185
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,900
it's part of solving problems and reducing risk

186
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,120
is taking a guess.

187
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,760
And there are so many great words that will help you

188
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,640
to sound more intelligent and more professional

189
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,860
when you have to take a guess.

190
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,320
We all do right?

191
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,480
But sometimes using 'guess' suggests that you're a little

192
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,100
uncertain, you know, and in a professional context,

193
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,760
it can make you seem

194
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,180
uninformed or unprepared.

195
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,160
So using 'estimate' suggests that

196
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,800
you've put some thought into this prediction

197
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,060
or this guess right?

198
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,600
Estimate.

199
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,780
It's difficult to estimate the financial impact for families.

200
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,440
Now 'calculate' is a really good option

201
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,880
when you're talking about specific numbers.

202
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,840
You calculate.

203
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,020
We calculate that this will save

204
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,880
three thousand dollars a month.

205
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,960
Now we have a slightly different word form here

206
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,120
but you can express the same idea by saying:

207
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,880
By our calculations, we will save

208
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,720
three thousand dollars a month.

209
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,140
When you're thinking about why something happened

210
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,380
or you're considering what might happen in the future,

211
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,040
then 'speculate' is a great word.

212
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,740
To speculate.

213
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,760
So usually we say 'speculate on' or

214
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,920
'speculate about' something.

215
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,100
I don't want to speculate on why he

216
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,740
resigned so suddenly.

217
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,160
And 'predict' is another great synonym for guess.

218
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,040
Predict.

219
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,940
So it's used when

220
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,180
you're taking information that you have

221
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,839
and you're making a call or a decision

222
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,040
about the most likely outcome.

223
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,000
Industry experts are predicting significant

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,940
changes to our working environments post-pandemic.

225
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,280
It is difficult to talk positively about problems right

226
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,420
when things aren't going so well or maybe they've been

227
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,520
a little more difficult than you anticipated.

228
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:11,160
So what words can you use instead of 'problem'

229
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,800
which does kind of have a negative about it, doesn't it?

230
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,340
Well we can say challenge,

231
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,080
we can say complication,

232
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,720
obstacle.

233
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,660
These are all possible replacements, right?

234
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,100
In a professional context, we want to make sure that we

235
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,460
communicate any problems that we have clearly

236
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,840
but also do it in a way that makes it sound like

237
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,860
you have solutions or you have a plan

238
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,200
to keep things under control.

239
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,460
We overcame several obstacles

240
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,060
before we landed on the result.

241
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,540
We anticipate some technical challenges but we're

242
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,300
confident that we've got the right team

243
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,180
in place to deal with them.

244
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,399
We even talk about problems as

245
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,680
headaches or hiccups.

246
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,460
These are a little less formal ways of expressing it

247
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,240
but they definitely help to emphasise that the problem is

248
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,700
not so serious you know or that they're problems that

249
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,940
can be managed, they're just annoying.

250
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,680
I can see how these changes could create

251
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,840
some headaches for the sales team

252
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,840
but we're working on a solution.

253
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,380
There were a few hiccups with the new ordering system

254
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,140
on Friday,

255
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,840
but things have been much smoother this week.

256
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,020
And lastly, if you work in an office as part of a team,

257
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,000
it's very likely that you work together

258
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,600
with other people to get things done, right?

259
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,560
We work together. We work as a team.

260
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,080
But just to clarify, we do not do a teamwork

261
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,700
all right? This is a very common mistake

262
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,640
that a lot of my students make.

263
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,980
'Teamwork' is a noun and we never use it with

264
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,240
'do' okay? We don't do a teamwork.

265
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,420
And a much more professional way to explain that

266
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:07,260
you're working together with someone else

267
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,700
or with other people

268
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,260
is to say that you collaborate.

269
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,540
I'm looking forward to collaborating

270
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,640
on projects with you in the future.

271
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,600
Now if you really want to emphasise that two people

272
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,760
or maybe two teams with different skill sets

273
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,620
or sets of expertise are coming together

274
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,660
to work together, we say that they're joining forces.

275
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,820
They join forces. And this is quite powerful.

276
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,660
When our development team joined forces with our

277
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,460
product team, they created something amazing.

278
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,620
So there you have it, I really hope that you found

279
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,120
a few new expressions to expand your vocabulary

280
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,079
range a little. Make sure that you keep these words

281
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,300
beside you at work during this week

282
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,440
and see if you can apply them.

283
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,380
You know if you're writing an email, make sure you stop

284
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,100
before you hit send, to try and

285
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,460
upgrade some of the language that you're using

286
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,040
to sound more professional and more helpful.

287
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,980
Now you know I like to set a little challenge

288
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,460
at the end of my lessons and that's because

289
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,340
just watching my lessons isn't really enough, is it?

290
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,600
You've got to put into practice what you've been learning

291
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,120
and it's only going to take you a few minutes.

292
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,620
So hit the pause button right now and write

293
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,760
a short paragraph using at least five of the

294
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,980
professional words that I shared during this lesson.

295
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,720
I'm really excited to get down there and check them out

296
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,080
to give you some feedback,

297
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,960
make sure you're using them correctly.

298
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,580
But in the meantime,

299
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,220
I've got this lesson right here ready for you

300
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,040
to continue practising with me

301
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,080
so I'll see you in there!
