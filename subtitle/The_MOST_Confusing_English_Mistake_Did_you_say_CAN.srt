1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:05,118
(bright soft music)

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,850
- Hello everyone and welcome
back to "English with Lucy",

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,640
today, we are going to be looking at

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,050
some really confusing words.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,620
Words that are pronounced
in very similar ways,

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,390
words that if you mispronounce them,

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,390
you could say one of the worst
swear words or curse words

8
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,720
in the English language.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,620
There's a lot to talk about
today, but don't worry,

10
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,990
I'm here to help you.

11
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:35,910
Before we get started,

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,180
I would like to thank the
sponsor of today's video,

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,890
it is Lingoda, Europe's number
one trusted language school

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,460
with their language marathon.

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,460
You can take the marathon in
English, Business English,

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,940
French, German and Spanish,

17
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,070
and gain up to 400 euros in cash back

18
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,590
when you attend at least
90% of your lessons.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,060
There are three different
marathons to choose from,

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,950
the quarter marathon, the half marathon

21
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,740
and the full marathon,

22
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,420
three months, six months
and 12 months respectively.

23
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,320
The personal cash back prize

24
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,540
just adds that extra push of motivation

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,300
to keep you attending your lessons.

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,360
With the full marathon,
the 12 month marathon,

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,450
you can progress up to
four language levels.

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,790
I'm really happy to share
this opportunity with you

29
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,570
because I have first hand
experience of how effective

30
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,660
the Lingoda language challenges can be,

31
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:34,970
they've transformed many
of my students' lives.

32
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,500
They love Lingoda because they
can interact in small groups

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,970
with amazing qualified teachers.

34
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,200
I actually secretly
joined one of Lingoda's

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,500
student Facebook groups

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,940
to see how everyone was getting on

37
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,210
and I was blown away by the
amount of students celebrating

38
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,170
their fluency transformations

39
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,570
and their cashback refunds as well.

40
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,070
So, don't sweat about your
language skills this summer,

41
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,990
take the Lingoda language marathon

42
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,560
and transform your fluency in
just three, six or 12 months.

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,860
One more thing,

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,699

and gain three classes
completely for free.

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,650
Let's get started with
those confusing words.

53
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,170
Remember, as always, I
have created a free PDF

54
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,640

55
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,780
if you want to get that,

and then you sign up for our mailing list,

plus free PDFs every week.

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,850
Firstly, let's look at can,

61
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,023
and can't.

62
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,900
Now, these can be really confusing words,

63
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,590
not only in the British pronunciation,

64
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,440
the various forms of
British pronunciation,

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,380
but in American English, it
gets even more complicated,

66
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,460
so, we're going to talk
about all of that today.

67
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,730
Firstly, let's talk about
strong and weak forms.

68
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:16,730
So, with the word, can, we
have can with the a sound,

69
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,110
but we also have cen with the Schwa sound

70
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,680
and this is a weak form.

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,040
Weak forms are syllable sounds that become

72
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,630
unstressed in connected speech

73
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,180
and they're often pronounced
as the schwa, a, a.

74
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,587
Can, a,

75
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,420
cen, e.

76
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,400
Take a look at this sentence.

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,720
When I'm speaking naturally, I would say,

78
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,380
I can do what I can.

79
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,660
So, the first can is a weak form, cen,

80
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,010
and the last one, it's an
important word so, it's can.

81
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,190
The first can is in its weak form

82
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,840
and the second one is stressed,
so, it's in its strong form.

83
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,920
Cen, can, I can do what I can.

84
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,550
This works for other
words as well, like do,

85
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,230
what do you want to do?

86
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,440
What do you want to do?

87
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,790
The first is unstressed
the second is stressed.

88
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,110
Now, let's take a look at can versus can't

89
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,110
with RP pronunciation, my pronunciation.

90
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,848
A, can

91
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:18,047
a, can't.

92
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:23,632
A, is a really short and wide sound, a, a,

93
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,210
with can't, we have a
different mouth shape

94
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,603
and it's a lot longer.

95
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,780
Aw,

96
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,500
Ah, aw, ah, (chuckles),

97
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,410
do I look silly?

98
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,030
Good, because that's how I meant to look

99
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,790
when I'm teaching pronunciation.

100
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,340
Can, can't, ah, aw.

101
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,590
Now, let's talk about a swear word,

102
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,440
I don't normally talk about
swear words on my channel,

103
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,760
in American English, they refer
to them as curse words, but

104
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,450
there is a vowel sound,

105
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,740
it is very similar to the aw sound,

106
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,480
if you use that in can't,

107
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,900
it makes a really bad word.

108
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,670
The vowel sound is, ah, ah,

109
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,080
so, we've got ah can't

110
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,240
and ah...

111
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,460
I'm not going to say it on this channel,

112
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,407
it's a really vulgar word,

113
00:05:16,407 --> 00:05:19,980
but if you would like to search
it and hear it for yourself,

114
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,770
then just replace the a and can't with a U

115
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,530
and I'm sure some robot dictionary will

116
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,870
tell you exactly what it sounds like.

117
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,840
Just be really mindful.

118
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,010
A, it's short and that's the bad version,

119
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:38,290
ah can't, that's longer and
that's the fine version.

120
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,520
Now, something to notice with
the pronunciation of can't

121
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,700
is that sometimes we don't
release that final T,

122
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,740
instead of saying can't, we might say can.

123
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,200
I can't do it not, I can't do it.

124
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,600
I can do it, I can do it.

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,290
I can do it, I can't do it,

126
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,630
I can do it, I can't do it.

127
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,690
So, you can't always
rely on hearing that T

128
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,840
to know if somebody is
saying can or can't.

129
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,140
Now, this is where it gets complicated

130
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,440
because in American English,

131
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,440
they use a very similar
vowel sound for can and can't

132
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:22,230
and they also avoid
releasing that T at the end.

133
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,140
So, can in American English

134
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,880
and you must excuse my terrible accent,

135
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
is cen, cen,

136
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,520
but can't in American
English is can't, can't.

137
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,400
Now, if they don't release that T,

138
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,650
then they sound very similar.

139
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,220
Cen, cen, cen, cen,

140
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,310
okay, brace yourself for this accent,

141
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,247
I can try, I can't try (laughs).

142
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,720
Now, I spoke to a couple
of my friends from the U.S

143
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,240
and they assured me that
they can hear the difference

144
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,500
because when they say can't, can't,

145
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,920
they make the vowel
sound much more abrupt.

146
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,590
Can,

147
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,880
can't,

148
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,190
can,

149
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,770
can't (laughs).

150
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,880
So, I hope you now feel
confident in pronouncing

151
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,500
can and can't

152
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,910
and avoid pronouncing that bad word,

153
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,280
unless you want to pronounce
it, which is fine by me,

154
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,800
just not on my channel,

155
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,610
and I hope you now have a better idea

156
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,810
about the differences between

157
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,570
can and can't in American English.

158
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,720
Now, let's talk about
some more pairs of words

159
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,600
that's even I find tricky
and I really have to clarify

160
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,740
exactly what I'm saying,

161
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,670
especially when I'm talking on the phone.

162
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,000
This is the difference
between teen and ty.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,660
Fourteen, forty.

164
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,550
If I say I want 14 coffees, please,

165
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,490
they might say, is that 14 or 40?

166
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,880
So, don't worry if you mix them up,

167
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,580
native speakers get confused
with it all the time.

168
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,470
It's actually very,

169
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,120
it's very annoying that
those words are so similar,

170
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,240
but in general speech, there
are differences between them.

171
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,380
Take a look at the phonetic transcriptions

172
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,330
of these two words,
let's go on to 16 and 60.

173
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,490
We have sixteen

174
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,440
and sixty.

175
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,820
You can see that in the teens,

176
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,783
the stress is on the second
syllable, but for the tys,

177
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,643
the stress is on the first syllable.

178
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:26,299
Sixteen, sixty,

179
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:27,632
fourteen, forty,

180
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,169
fifteen, fifty,

181
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,393
seventeen, seventy,

182
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,355
eighteen, eighty,

183
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,437
nineteen, ninety,

184
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,330
twenteen, twenty, just
joking with that last one,

185
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,233
I hope you didn't write that down, if so,

186
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,490
rub it out.

187
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,820
So, if you want to be really clear,

188
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,000
especially when speaking over the phone

189
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,470
when you can't lip read
or really hear too well,

190
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,240
make sure you really over accentuate

191
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,330
the stress of the word
you're trying to use.

192
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,870
I said 60,

193
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,507
not 16 (laughs).

194
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,150
I'm going to do really quick
quiz for you right now,

195
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,390
just to make sure you
understand the differences,

196
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,750
write your answers in the
comment section down below

197
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,210
and then I'll start correcting
the first ones I see,

198
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,610
you've got to tell me whether
I'm saying teen or ty, okay,

199
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,443
number one,

200
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,830
60 people came to the game last night,

201
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,893
I got my dog when I was 17,

202
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,663
I've been with my husband for 17 years,

203
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,200
and the last one, I'm only
having 18 people at the wedding.

204
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,913
I'm only having 80 people at the wedding.

205
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,667
Right, that is it for today's
lesson, I hope you enjoyed it

206
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,310
and I hope you learned something,

207
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,730
I hope I clarified some of your doubts.

208
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,440

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:33,180

226
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,060
where I've got a really
cool pronunciation tool,

227
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,630
you can test out pressing all
of the phonemes and hearing me

228
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,850
say those phonemes and say
words containing those phonemes,

229
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,203
it's great fun.

230
00:10:44,053 --> 00:10:45,230
E.

231
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,305
No.

232
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:47,610
Air.

233
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,140
And I've also got my vlogging channel

234
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,840
if you want to practise your vocabulary

235
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,360
and improve your listening skills,

236
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,150
all of my vlogs are fully subtitled

237
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,390
and they document my life here
in the English countryside.

238
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,840
I will see you soon for
another lesson (kissing).

239
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,440
There's a lot to talk about today.

240
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,570
With the full marathon, the
one year marathon (mumbles).

241
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,574
Schwa sound and this is a weak form.

242
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:09,950
(tummy grumbling)

243
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,650
Sorry, that was my tummy (laughs).

244
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,296
Phoneme.

245
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:17,296
(bright soft music)

246
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:35,383
(bright upbeat music)
