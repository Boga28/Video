1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,420
In this English lesson,

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,260
I want to teach you some English phrases

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,700
that you can use to talk about time,

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,500
but not simple phrases.
like it's 10 after 10,

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,030
or it's five to two.

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,200
In this English lesson,

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,260
I want to teach you
phrases that you can use

8
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,200
to talk about the past or the future.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,100
I want to teach you phrases about time

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,840
that you can use to talk about
things that happen quickly,

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,050
or that you can use
when you're in a hurry,

12
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,980
or to talk about things
that happen occasionally.

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:26,813
So stick around.

14
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:28,760
I think you'll learn a
lot in this English lesson

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,014
about time.

16
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:32,681
(upbeat music)

17
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,670
Let's start this English lesson

18
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,850
by learning a couple
phrases that you can use

19
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,760
to talk about a future event,

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,270
and a couple of phrases you can use

21
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,160
to talk about a past event.

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,000
In English, when there is an
event that's in the future,

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,710
and if it's far in the future,
we might say it's a ways off.

24
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,200
Or we might say it's a long ways off.

25
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,680
When we talk about an
event that was in the past,

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,400
and a while ago in the past,

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,110
we would say that it was a while ago,

28
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,470
or it was a while back.

29
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,870
Notice how I couldn't help,

30
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,970
but use the phrase a while ago,

31
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,320
while talking about something in the past.

32
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,530
Let's create some example sentences.

33
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,600
Let's say your birthday
is in a few months.

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,410
If someone said, when is your birthday?

35
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,090
You could say, my birthday is a ways off.

36
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,820
Or my birthday is a long ways off.

37
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,010
If your birthday was several months ago.

38
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,980
And if someone said,
is your birthday soon?

39
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,170
You could say, no, my
birthday was a while back.

40
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,430
My birthday was a while ago.

41
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,950
So in English, when you're
talking about a future event,

42
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,900
you can say a ways off,
or a long ways off.

43
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,970
And when you're talking
about a past event,

44
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,180
you can say a while ago, or a while back.

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,730
Well, hey, welcome to this
English lesson about time.

46
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,640
Before we continue with
the lesson, though,

47
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,350
if this is your first time here,

48
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,740
don't forget to click that red
subscribe button over there,

49
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,090
and give me a thumbs up if
this video helps you learn

50
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,950
just a little bit more English.

51
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,150
Sometimes when we talk about time,

52
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,410
we want to talk about how
time goes by really quickly.

53
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,400
And there's a few phrases we
can use for this in English.

54
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,990
Sometimes for me, a certain
month will go by really quickly.

55
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,060
And I would use the
phrase, that went by fast,

56
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,150
and I can be specific.

57
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,340
I could say, wow, that month went by fast.

58
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,540
And we have a few more phrases as well.

59
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,250
Sometimes we ask this question, we'll say,

60
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,230
where did the time go?

61
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,750
When you say, where did
the time go in English,

62
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,490
you're expressing that
something in the past

63
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,490
just happened really, really quickly.

64
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,670
I could say, wow, it's already October.

65
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,870
Where did the time go?

66
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,990
Sometimes we use this phrase as well.

67
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,010
We'll say, it seems like just yesterday.

68
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,250
And we use this phrase to introduce

69
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,130
an idea to the conversation.

70
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,290
The best one I can think of is this.

71
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,540
Because I have children,

72
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,160
I could say it seems like just yesterday,

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,440
they were really little.

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,230
They've all grown up quite a bit by now.

75
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,710
So sometimes when we talk
about how time goes quickly,

76
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,760
we'll use the phrase, it
seems like just yesterday.

77
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,270
And there's a phrase that
you're probably familiar with,

78
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,460
time flies.

79
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,500
Sometimes we add time flies
when you're having fun,

80
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,990
but sometimes we'll just say,
whoa, time flies, doesn't it?

81
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,860
When you talk about a month
that went by quickly, or a year,

82
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,580
sometimes a whole year goes
by, and you're like wow,

83
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,970
it's already 2021.

84
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,330
Wow, time flies.

85
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,780
Actually 2021's almost over, isn't it?

86
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,990
Wow, time flies.

87
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,730
In about 15 years, I'll be retired.

88
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,430
And then I'll have all
the time in the world.

89
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,580
The English phrase, all
the time in the world,

90
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:31,050
refers to someone who has
so much time every day,

91
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:33,420
they don't even know how to fill it.

92
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,530
They don't know what
to do during their day.

93
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,150
And this usually reminds
me of retired people.

94
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,740
I know retired people are actually busy,

95
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,580
but I always think when I'm retired,

96
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,020
I'll have all the time in the world.

97
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,810
Another English phrase
we use to talk about

98
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,680
having extra time, or having
time is a little different.

99
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,960
And it's the phrase, time to kill.

100
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,360
This is a phrase you would use

101
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,300
if you were at the airport
to pick up your friend.

102
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,030
And if you found out their
flight was delayed by four hours,

103
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,900
you would then say, oh,
I have time to kill.

104
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,850
You have an amount of time

105
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,700
where you really can't do anything else.

106
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,070
You need to wait for them.

107
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,160
So in that case, we would
use that English phrase.

108
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,660
We would say, you have time to kill.

109
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,180
Of course, there's also times

110
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,829
when you don't have enough time,

111
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,079
where you are in a hurry,
or you are in a rush.

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,449
And then we would probably say

113
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,550
that you are pressed for time.

114
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,810
Sometimes in the morning when
I'm getting ready for work,

115
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,180
I'm running a little bit late,

116
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,550
and then I'm pressed for time.

117
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,770
It simply means that I'm
in a rush, I'm in a hurry.

118
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,340
I'm going to be late for
work if I don't get moving.

119
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,310
So when you're pressed for time,

120
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,670
it means you're probably going
to be late for something.

121
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,340
And then we also use kind of the negative

122
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,870
of a phrase I taught you earlier.

123
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,960
We might say that you don't
have all the time in the world.

124
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,360
This is something that I
might say to my children.

125
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,860
If I'm ready to go and they're not,

126
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,740
I might say, let's get going.

127
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,560
I don't have all the time in the world.

128
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,050
So sometimes you're late,
sometimes you're in a hurry,

129
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,870
and you can use one of those two phrases.

130
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,590
You could say I'm pressed for time,

131
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,550
or hey, hurry up, everybody.

132
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,610
I don't have all the time in the world.

133
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,560
Sometimes when you're talking about time,

134
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,440
you want to describe something
that happened really quickly,

135
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,200
like a car accident.

136
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,210
In that situation,

137
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,390
you would use the English
phrase in the blink of an eye.

138
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,020
You could say I was driving along,

139
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,230
and then in the blink of an eye,

140
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,780
someone pulled out in front
of me, and I hit them.

141
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,930
That wouldn't be very nice,

142
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,070
but that is the English
phrase you would use.

143
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,860
You would say it happened
in the blink of an eye.

144
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,900
Sometimes when I go to my
classroom, I forget something,

145
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,520
and I have to go back to my
teacher work area to get it.

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,280
In that situation, I
would say to students,

147
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,900
I'll be back in a flash.

148
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,840
The English phrase in a flash

149
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,730
indicates that hardly
any time will take place

150
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,540
for whatever's going to happen.

151
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,440
So if it's before class starts,

152
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,620
and I'm like, oh, I forgot my laptop.

153
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,418
I might say to my students,
I'll be back in a flash,

154
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,200
and then we'll get started on the lesson.

155
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,870
Another phrase we use in English

156
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,720
to describe when someone
does a job quickly

157
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,960
is to say that they did it in no time,

158
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,190
or they did it in no time flat.

159
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,900
Sometimes when I go out to
make my English lessons,

160
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,880
I'm done in no time, I'm
done in no time flat,

161
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,430
because the words come to me very easily.

162
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,350
Surprisingly, with this video,

163
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,540
I'm not getting this done in no time flat.

164
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,070
It's taking a lot longer than I expected,

165
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,630
because I keep mispronouncing
words for some reason.

166
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,200
But normally when I make
these English lessons,

167
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,620
I'm done in no time, or
I'm done in no time flat,

168
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,140
meaning that it goes fairly quickly.

169
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,040
There's a few English phrases we use

170
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,940
to talk about things
that happen occasionally.

171
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,590
We say things like this
every once in a while,

172
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,800
or from time to time,
or once in a blue moon.

173
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,900
Let me give you some example sentences.

174
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,490
Every once in a while, we take
the kids out for ice cream.

175
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,970
That means we don't do it every day,

176
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,690
we don't do it every week,
but we do it once a month,

177
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,120
maybe every other month.

178
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,560
Every once in a while, we take
the kids out for ice cream.

179
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,310
Another phrase we use is the
phrase from time to time.

180
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,400
And I can say this, from time to time,

181
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,160
Jen and I go out on a date.

182
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,350
From time to time, we
leave the kids at home,

183
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,310
and we go out with just the two of us

184
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,210
for a meal, and maybe to see a movie.

185
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,290
So from time to time means I
guess every other month or so,

186
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,550
maybe every three months.

187
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,890
There's no specific time
attached to these phrases.

188
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,920
And then the phrase once in a blue moon.

189
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,760
When I was younger,

190
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,170
I went and saw movies with
my friends all the time,

191
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,480
but now I go once in a blue moon.

192
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,291
That means that because
I'm older, and I'm married,

193
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,080
and I have kids, I'm really busy,

194
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,010
I don't actually go out with my friends

195
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,620
as often as I used to.

196
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,950
So once in a blue moon,

197
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,210
my friends and I will go and see a movie.

198
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,430
That means probably once a year.

199
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,310
That's about the average right now.

200
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,100
Once in a blue moon, we
go out to see a movie.

201
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,480
It should be more often, shouldn't it?

202
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,960
Yeah, I should call them
tonight and see if they want to,

203
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,320
but we're still in a pandemic, aren't we?

204
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,110
Maybe I'll wait until next year.

205
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,310
Well, hey, thank you so much

206
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,710

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,430

208
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,540
that you can use to talk about time.

209
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,540

210
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,310

214
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,120
why don't you stick around,

215
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,127

216
00:08:09,127 --> 00:08:11,794
