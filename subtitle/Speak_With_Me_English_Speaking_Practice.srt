1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,110
Vanessa:
"Hi.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,300
Oh, what a cute dog.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,230
What kind is he?"

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,980
Oh, is your heart starting to beat kind of
fast?

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,459
Do you know how to respond to this question?

6
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:14,900
Do you know how to talk about your pets in
English?

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,890
Well, never fear today.

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,270
I'm going to help you talk comfortably about
your pets in English.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,480
Let's do it.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,320
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,150
And in today's exciting lesson, you are going
to get a chance to speak with me and tell

12
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,530
me all about your precious pet.

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,220
And if you've never had a pet, well, this
is a great time to also learn how to talk

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,489
about that because people often ask, "What?

15
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,149
Do you not like animals?

16
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,790
Why don't you have a pet?

17
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:52,170
Do you not like dogs?"

18
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:57,730
So in today's lesson, you will be able to
comfortably learn some common vocabulary around

19
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,730
pets.

20
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,230
Also, some common conversational questions
about pets.

21
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:08,900
And then you'll see a sample conversation
between my husband and I talking about pets.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,150
And then it will be your turn to learn how
to speak with me and we'll talk about your

23
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,150
pets.

24
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,880
And I have a little surprise today.

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,770
At the end of this lesson, you are going to
meet my nine pets.

26
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,360
Yes, that's right.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Nine pets.

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,080
It might be a little surprising.

29
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,950
So you have to wait to the end of this lesson
to find out.

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,350
To help you with this lesson, I have created
a free PDF worksheet that you can download

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,530
with the link in the description below this
video.

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,259
On this free PDF worksheet, you will get all
of today's common vocabulary, all of the sample

33
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,619
sentences, all of the common questions and
answers, the sample conversation.

34
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:52,890
And you will have a chance to answer Vanessa's
challenge question so that you can use what

35
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,470
you've learned and never forget it in daily
conversation.

36
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,829
All right, are you ready to get started?

37
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,200
Let's learn some common vocabulary about animals
and pets.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,119
Let's start by describing you.

39
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,180
Can you describe yourself?

40
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,080
I am an animal lover.

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,080
This means that you love all kinds of animals.

42
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,650
You might say, "Ever since I first visited
a zoo as a child, I have been an animal lover.

43
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,910
I just love all animals."

44
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:26,250
Or if you would like to be a little more specific,
you could say, "I'm a cat person.

45
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,420
I'm a dog person."

46
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,830
Usually we keep it to cats and dogs, but you
might say, "I'm a horse person."

47
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,230
Does that mean that you have a cat head?

48
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,780
I am a cat person.

49
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,990
No, this just means that that is your preferred
pet.

50
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,430
You like cats.

51
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:48,350
So for me, if you've been watching my English
lessons for a while, you know I am a cat person.

52
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:54,080
I've never had a dog, but I feel like I relate
more to cats, I get along better with cats

53
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,500
and I feel more comfortable with cats.

54
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,840
But maybe for you, you might say, "I'm a dog
person.

55
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,350
I would rather have a dog."

56
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:08,209
Or maybe you have this unfortunate situation,
you are allergic to dogs.

57
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:11,920
Or maybe you might say, "I'm allergic to cat
fur.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
I love them.

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,830
They're so cute and cuddly and I wish I could
have a cat, but I'm allergic."

60
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:23,350
If your eyes start to get red and your nose
starts to run, maybe your throat hurts.

61
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,350
That's a bad sign.

62
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,550
It means that you are allergic to some kind
of animal.

63
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,020
Maybe you can take some simple medicine and
you'll be fine.

64
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,150
But sometimes it's a bigger problem than that
and you just can't have a cat.

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,530
You can't have a dog.

66
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,310
I hope you're not allergic.

67
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,739
Now let's describe your pet.

68
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,629
But a little note, first of all, something
that I've noticed that's different between

69
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:51,170
English and some other languages is that when
we're talking about our pets or someone else's

70
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:54,709
pet, we use he or she.

71
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:01,790
We don't use it very often because it feels
like you're creating some kind of distance

72
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,190
or it's a wild animal, or you don't really
care about that animal.

73
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,460
It's just an object, it.

74
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:14,370
So for example, if I'm going to tell you about
my cat, little spoiler, I have a cat.

75
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,418
I might say, "She is Siamese cat."

76
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,518
If I say I have a cat, it's Siamese.

77
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:21,930
It's okay.

78
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:28,619
And you will hear this occasionally, but it's
more common to hear he or she.

79
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:30,270
She's a Siamese.

80
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,250
She likes to play with cat toys, he or she.

81
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,569
And if you're not certain if an animal is
a he or a she, like if you see a neighbor's

82
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:44,199
dog and you want to talk to that neighbor
about their dog, you can just say he and it's

83
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,199
okay.

84
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,449
The neighbor will maybe correct you and say,
"Oh yes, she's a Poodle."

85
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,610
And then you can say, "Oh yes, what's her
name."

86
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,020
And you can use her when you find out.

87
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,490
But in general, we use he or she for pets.

88
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,349
A common word we use to describe pets is breed.

89
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:04,150
What breed is your pet?

90
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,759
But we often just say kind, what kind is it?

91
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,259
So when we're talking about a dog or a cat,
there are different types.

92
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,930
So I already mentioned, my cat is a Siamese
cat.

93
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,360
This is a specific type or breed of cat.

94
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,719
What breed is your cat?

95
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:28,110
Oh, he's a Siamese she's a Siamese.

96
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,110
What breed is it?

97
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:31,479
But we often use the question what kind is
it?

98
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,569
Which we'll talk about in our questions section
in a minute.

99
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:38,800
Another common term used with pets is a rescue.

100
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,969
This is describing your pet.

101
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:43,649
Both of my cats are rescues.

102
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:46,849
I got them from an animal shelter.

103
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:53,839
This means that I didn't buy them from a breeder
who is making pure bred cats.

104
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:56,159
No, I went to the animal shelter.

105
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:59,229
These are abandoned cats who need a home.

106
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:02,740
I went to the animal shelter and I adopted.

107
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,449
We often use the word adopted.

108
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,460
I adopted too two cats.

109
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,629
They are rescue cats or they are rescues.

110
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:15,059
And this is the idea that I rescued them.

111
00:06:15,059 --> 00:06:21,580
Sometimes in the US you see a bumper sticker,
something like this that says my dog rescued

112
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,610
me.

113
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,440
Have you ever felt like this?

114
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,569
Maybe you saved your dog from the animal shelter,
but really your dog changed your life.

115
00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:33,259
Your dog rescued you.

116
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,339
You might also hear the word mutt, mutt cannon
be a little negative.

117
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:43,810
If you say it with a negative voice, but it
just means that you're not certain what kind

118
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,250
of dog you have.

119
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,199
We only use this for dogs.

120
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,219
And it means, well, it's a mix of so many
different types of dogs that I have no idea.

121
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:53,219
He's a mutt.

122
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:55,240
We got him from the animal shelter, but you
know what?

123
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,080
He's the best dog I've ever had.

124
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,919
He's a mutt, but I don't care.

125
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,990
So it's that idea that he's not pure.

126
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,129
He's not a pure bred dog.

127
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:07,689
He's a mix of so many kinds of dogs, but you
know what?

128
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,879
It's still a great animal.

129
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,360
Next is fur and coat.

130
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,770
My cat's fur is so soft.

131
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,389
After I give my dog a bath, he has a silky
coat.

132
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,449
He's not wearing a coat.

133
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:23,209
It's just talking about his fur.

134
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:25,729
And these words are kind of interchangeable.

135
00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:27,569
He has soft fur.

136
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:29,069
He has a silky coat.

137
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,990
So great words to talk about animal hair.

138
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,669
Let's talk about some words we can use to
talk about how friendly an animal is.

139
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,569
The first one is just friendly.

140
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:41,830
He's friendly.

141
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,479
You'll often hear this as someone is walking
their dog and if their dog wants to come closer

142
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,520
to you, the owner might say, "Oh, don't worry.

143
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
He's friendly.

144
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,580
He loves little kids."

145
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,629
And your child can pet the dog.

146
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,229
Or you might ask, "Is he friendly?"

147
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,059
And that means, "Can I pet him?"

148
00:08:00,059 --> 00:08:05,771
So it's a great word to use, to talk about
if your dog is comfortable with people, he's

149
00:08:05,771 --> 00:08:06,771
friendly.

150
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:11,580
"He's not very friendly with little kids so
we'll just try to stay away."

151
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,770
There are three words that are variations
of this.

152
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:20,120
One is wild lions are wild.

153
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,430
They are not friendly towards people.

154
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,539
I do not recommend trying to pet a lion.

155
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,610
They are wild.

156
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,199
The next level is stray.

157
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:38,559
We might say that cat is a stray cat or he's
a stray.

158
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,649
And that means that he lives on the streets
and maybe he'll come close to people to get

159
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,650
some food.

160
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,200
He might not really hurt you, but he doesn't
want to live in your house.

161
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,459
Maybe if you adopt him, he'll want to live
in your house, but he doesn't have an owner.

162
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:55,670
He's a stray.

163
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,079
He's a stray cat.

164
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,110
Some cities around the world have a lot of
stray cats or stray dogs.

165
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,819
They don't belong to anyone, but everyone
helps to take care of them.

166
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:05,920
Everyone helps to feed them.

167
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,880
In the US, this isn't very common.

168
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,000
We don't have a lot of stray cats or a lot
of stray dogs because animal shelters are

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,959
a big part of American culture.

170
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:21,860
A lot of people when they want a pet, they
will go to an animal shelter instead of buying

171
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,230
a pure bred dog or a pure bred cat.

172
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:31,670
So a lot of stray dogs or straight cats who
live on the street will be taken to an animal

173
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,569
shelter for someone to adopt.

174
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:38,070
So you might say, "My cat was a stray before
we got him.

175
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:42,430
He was a stray cat before we got him and now
he's just so friendly."

176
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,670
The next level is domesticated.

177
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:53,220
So this means a cat or dog or animal that
was previously wild, and now he's very comfortable

178
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,600
with humans.

179
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,019
So we could use this for a lot of different
animals like cows.

180
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:01,360
Cows are domesticated.

181
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,790
A long time ago, they were completely wild
or horses.

182
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:10,769
Horses were completely wild, but they have
become domesticated over time.

183
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:14,500
People have trained them to become comfortable
with humans.

184
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,350
They are domesticated.

185
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,250
We often use this term for farm animals; horses,
cows, chickens, sheep, goats.

186
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,540
They are domesticated animals.

187
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,970
Some animals just can't be domesticated like
a zebra.

188
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,420
You can't ride a zebra.

189
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,189
You can't domesticate zebras.

190
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:36,529
It would be pretty cool, but they're just
an animal that cannot be domesticated.

191
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:41,470
Before we go onto some common questions that
you will hear and that you can ask about pets,

192
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,029
let's talk about pet care and some words that
you can use to describe pet care.

193
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:52,870
A cage, a crate and a kennel are all the same
thing and it's somewhere that you can keep

194
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,860
your animal contained.

195
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,399
So you might say, "I put my ferret."

196
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,990
Some people have a ferret for a pet.

197
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,339
"I put my ferret in the crate to take it to
the vet," which we'll talk about in just a

198
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:11,430
second, but it's a type of box where you will
keep your animals maybe to transport them

199
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:14,629
somewhere, or maybe just to help them feel
safe and comfortable.

200
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:20,529
We have a big kennel for my dog to help him
feel comfortable when guests come over.

201
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:22,290
He goes in there and he feels comfortable.

202
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,640
And then when the guests leave, he comes out
and feels very safe.

203
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:32,560
A collar and tag, this goes around your animal's
neck and has some important information like

204
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,060
the pet's name, your phone number, maybe your
address.

205
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,129
And if your pet gets lost, well, someone can
help you to find your pet again by calling

206
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:46,750
you with the number that's on the tag on their
collar.

207
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:52,949
A collar is also useful because you can attach
a leash to the collar.

208
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:54,639
Sometimes this is called a lead.

209
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:01,249
I think that lead is maybe more a term that
professional people will use.

210
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:02,940
A veterinarian will use this.

211
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,160
Maybe a dog trainer will use this, a lead.

212
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,860
But for daily conversation, we often just
say leash.

213
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,860
Where's the leash?

214
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,589
I need to find the dog's leash so that I can
take him on a walk.

215
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:19,760
One time I saw somebody having an iguana on
a leash.

216
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,540
Sometimes people put their cats on a leash
too, but usually cats don't tolerate that.

217
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,420
Have you ever seen a strange animal on a leash
before?

218
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,130
A vet or veterinarian, usually we shorten
this to vet.

219
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,580
You've already heard me say this a couple
of times and that's the doctor for an animal.

220
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:46,040
So you might say, "I need to take my sick
dog to the vet" or "what is the best vet to

221
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,990
take my dog to?"

222
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,860
We're talking about veterinarian, but it's
a situation where we don't use the longest

223
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
word.

224
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,470
We just use a short, simple version.

225
00:12:55,470 --> 00:13:00,879
Yes, finally in English there is a simple
way to say a long word.

226
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,600
So you can just say vet.

227
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,769
"My cat's vet is just up the street or we
have a vet appointment next week."

228
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:09,019
Excellent.

229
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:13,500
Now I just want to let you know if this is
your job if you are a vet in someone asks

230
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,069
you the common question, "What do you do?"

231
00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:17,550
Which means what's your job?

232
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,680
And you say, "I'm a vet."

233
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,250
Well, this might be slightly confusing if
someone has no idea that you work with animals.

234
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:32,689
Because a vet can be two different things,
it can be a veterinarian or it can be a veteran,

235
00:13:32,689 --> 00:13:33,689
a veteran.

236
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:39,800
That means someone who used to be a soldier,
they used to be in the military and now they're

237
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,029
retired.

238
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:46,769
So that means that you could either be an
animal doctor or a retired person from the

239
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:47,970
military.

240
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,760
So if someone knows that you work with animals
or that you're a doctor, if you say, "Oh,

241
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,920
I'm a doctor" and they ask what kind of doctor
you could say, "I'm a vet."

242
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,499
Okay, they will know that you work with animals.

243
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:02,759
But if someone has no clue, you might say,
"I'm a veterinarian."

244
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,819
You might elongate that a little bit.

245
00:14:04,819 --> 00:14:06,639
Just to be more specific.

246
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:13,800
Or if you are a vet from the military, you
might say, "I'm a retired veteran" or "I'm

247
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,949
a retired vet.

248
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,339
I was in the Navy."

249
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:17,829
You might want to be a little more specific.

250
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:21,190
So that's a situation that might possibly
come up.

251
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,160
What can you do to bond with your animal?

252
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,069
You might play fetch.

253
00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:30,110
So you could say, "My cat likes to play fetch."

254
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,980
Who would have guessed?

255
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,120
Usually dogs do, but sometimes cats do too.

256
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,779
Or you could just say this word to your dog.

257
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:42,170
So you have a stick, you throw the stick and
your dog runs after the stick.

258
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,089
You could say, "Fetch boy, fetch.

259
00:14:45,089 --> 00:14:46,089
Fetch the stick."

260
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:49,399
So you're telling him, you're giving him a
command about what he should do.

261
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:51,540
Get the stick and bring it back to you.

262
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,990
This is kind of a fun game.

263
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,610
Or we might just pet your pet.

264
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:01,180
Ooh, so this word can be used as a noun.

265
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,800
As we've been talking about it, I have nine
pets, but what is this?

266
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,850
Gently touching your pet.

267
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,360
This is the verb to pet.

268
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,840
When you are stroking or just gently touching
your animal, this is a very kind, nice thing

269
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
to do.

270
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,629
Well, you are petting your pet.

271
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:28,279
So if you're walking down the street and someone
is walking a dog and that dog seems friendly,

272
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,160
the dog wants to talk with you.

273
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,769
And the owner says, "Oh, don't worry.

274
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:32,779
He's friendly."

275
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:35,129
You can say, "Can I pet him?"

276
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:39,709
Great, that means that you can stroke his
head or his back or under his chin.

277
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:45,269
And it's a nice way to enjoy a dog and to
kind of connect with each other.

278
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:50,160
Okay, are you ready to go onto some common
questions that people will ask you about your

279
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,389
pets and also you can ask?

280
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,389
Let's do it.

281
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,830
Do you have any pets?

282
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,829
Very simple and straightforward question.

283
00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:01,559
You might say, "When I was a kid, I had a
dog, but now I don't have any pets."

284
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:02,559
Okay.

285
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,740
Well, this is just answering in a nicer way
than just, "No, I don't have any pets."

286
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,040
You're giving some information.

287
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,720
"When I was a kid, I had a dog and now I don't
have any pets."

288
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,740
Good answer.

289
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,279
When you see a dog, a common question is what
kind is he?

290
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,930
We're talking about the breed of dog.

291
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,550
What kind is he?

292
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:31,740
It's sometimes unusual to see a pure bred
dog that's only one kind, only one breed.

293
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,000
So you'll often hear this type of answer.

294
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,970
"He's a lab mix.

295
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,970
We got him at the animal shelter."

296
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,209
He's a mix.

297
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:44,879
So this means he has two different or maybe
three or four different types of dogs in his

298
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:45,879
blood.

299
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,079
So we could say, "He's a mix or he's a lab
mix."

300
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:52,259
And this means he comes from different types
of breeds.

301
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,220
Another common question is what's his name?

302
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,459
Of course, you can just say your pet's name,
but I wanted to give you some of the most

303
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:05,699
common female pet names and also some of the
most common male pet names in English.

304
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:14,520
So the most common female pet names are Bella,
Luna, Lucy, Daisy, and Coco.

305
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:20,890
There are many other pet names for female
dogs or cats or horses or who knows what,

306
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,520
but these are some of the most common.

307
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,148
In fact, one of my cats' names is Luna.

308
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:34,870
Some of the most common male pet names are
Max, Buddy, Teddy, Rocky, and Duke.

309
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:38,730
These are really common male pet names in
the US.

310
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,940
A question we already talked about is is he
friendly?

311
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,940
Great.

312
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,840
Someone might ask you this if you have a dog
and you're welcome to ask someone else this

313
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,659
if you want to pet a dog.

314
00:17:48,659 --> 00:17:49,660
Is he friendly?

315
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,410
"Yes, you can pet him."

316
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,080
Another common question is how long have you
had him?

317
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,270
And maybe this is not how old is he, but how
long has he been a part of your life?

318
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,450
So you might say, "I got Max from the animal
shelter three years ago."

319
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,010
How long have you had him?

320
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,090
"I've had him for three years."

321
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:14,100
If you mentioned that your dog or someone
else mentions that their dog is a specific

322
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,279
breed, you could ask this question.

323
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:19,179
"What made you decide to get that breed?"

324
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:21,020
Maybe you're just curious about that breed.

325
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:24,960
You're trying to have a conversation, or maybe
you're thinking about getting a dog too and

326
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,880
you want some more information.

327
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,020
So you could say, "What made you decide to
get that breed?"

328
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:35,320
And if somebody has, for example, a Lab, which
is a Labrador Retriever.

329
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,669
If somebody has a Lab, they might say, "Well,
I heard that Labs are family-friendly dogs

330
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:42,510
so we decided to get one."

331
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:46,700
Okay, they have a reputation for being good
with kids, for being friendly.

332
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,400
"They're family-friendly so we decided to
get one."

333
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,279
All right, now that we've practiced some common
vocabulary about pets, some common questions

334
00:18:54,279 --> 00:19:00,330
about pets, now I'd like to show you a sample
conversation between my husband, Dan and I

335
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,440
talking about some pets.

336
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,970
After this sample conversation, it will be
your turn to speak with me and tell me about

337
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,309
your pets or maybe the pets that you wish
you had.

338
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:14,539
And after that will be the big reveal of my
nine pets.

339
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:17,059
All right, let's watch the sample conversation.

340
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:19,860
Hi, Dan, is that your dog?

341
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,580
I thought you were a cat person.

342
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,080
Dan:
Hey, Vanessa.

343
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,059
I'm an animal lover, but Fluffy's not mine.

344
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:28,140
I'm just walking him for a friend.

345
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,140
Vanessa:
Oh, gotcha.

346
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,270
Is he friendly?

347
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,270
Can I pet him?

348
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,940
Dan:
Yes, he's friendly.

349
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,539
You can pet him, but watch out he drools.

350
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:37,770
Vanessa:
Oh, good to know.

351
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,020
Well, I'll stick to my non-drooling cats.

352
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,570
Oh, but good boy, Fluffy.

353
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,310
Dan:
I'm going to walk them at the park to play

354
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,310
fetch.

355
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,310
Want to come?

356
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,310
Vanessa:
Sure.

357
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,240
Okay, now it's your turn.

358
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,299
I'm going to be asking you a couple of questions
and then I'm going to pause and you can speak

359
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:02,300
out loud and try to answer these questions
and pretend like we're having a conversation

360
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,450
together.

361
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,000
If you feel like it's too short of a pause,
feel free to pause this video.

362
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,809
That's kind of the bonus thing, exciting thing
about having a video conversation.

363
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:17,799
You can pause me and spend some extra time
explaining what you'd like to say.

364
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,799
All right.

365
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:19,799
Are you ready?

366
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,109
Take a deep breath.

367
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:22,140
Let's do it.

368
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
Hi.

369
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,059
I didn't know you had a pet.

370
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:32,330
What kind is he?

371
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,890
Interesting.

372
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:42,649
How long have you had him?

373
00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:43,740
That's so nice.

374
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,700
You know, I've been thinking about getting
one too.

375
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,240
What do you like to do with him?

376
00:20:51,240 --> 00:21:01,250
Thanks for your help and nice to meet you.

377
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,420
So how did you do?

378
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,960
Are you ready to talk about your pets now?

379
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
I hope so.

380
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,940
I hope I have empowered you to be able to
speak more comfortably about this common conversation

381
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
topic.

382
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,760
And now drum roll.

383
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,409
It's time to meet my nine pets.

384
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,190
Are you ready?

385
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,520
This is Pippen.

386
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,430
He's a tuxedo cat.

387
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,630
This isn't a breed, but it just describes
his coloration.

388
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,580
And this is Luna, she's a Siamese, but we
got them both from a shelter so she's probably

389
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,190
not a pure bred Siamese.

390
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,860
And my other seven pets are chickens.

391
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,690
They're only two-months-old, but aren't they
so big?

392
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:47,679
Unfortunately, we have to wait until October
until they start producing eggs.

393
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,000
I can't wait.

394
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,320
My husband Dan built their coop, that's the
little house where they live and this area

395
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,120
is called the run.

396
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,080
It's a safe area for them to be outside without
getting eaten by wild animals we hope.

397
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,130
We got them when they were one-day-old.

398
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,470
Look how cute they were.

399
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:13,809
This is a new adventure for us to have farm
animals, but I can't wait to get some fresh

400
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:14,809
eggs.

401
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,510
And it's a great thing to do with kids.

402
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,910
Go down to the chicken coop in the morning
and gather the eggs.

403
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,910
I can't wait.

404
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,120
That'll be so much fun.

405
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,409
Well, I hope that today's lesson was helpful
for you.

406
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:30,779
And I want to remind you that you can download
the free PDF worksheet for all of the sample

407
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,870
phrases, all of the sample questions and answers,
the conversation.

408
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:40,620
And you can answer Vanessa's challenge question
so that you can remember what you've learned

409
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,960
and use it in your daily conversations.

410
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,630
So I have a question for you.

411
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,260
Let me know in the comments are you a cat
person, a dog person, maybe a chicken person?

412
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,891
Let me know in the comments and I can't wait
to learn more about you.

413
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:59,320

me and I'll see you again next Friday for

414

416
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,299
The next step is to download the free PDF
worksheet for this lesson.
