00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa  

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:08,400
from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. It's your 
birthday. Happy birthday. Let's talk about it. 

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,480
Hey, I heard you have a birthday 
coming up. Do you got any plans?  

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,400
If I asked you this, would you know what to 
say or would your heart start pounding? Oh no,  

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,120
oh no, what do I say? Well, in today's lesson, 
you are going to master some common answers to  

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,160
birthday questions, some common questions that 
you can ask other people when it's their birthday,  

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,960
and at the end of this lesson, you'll have 
a special speaking practice where you will  

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,440
finally have the opportunity to speak with me out 
loud. There will be a little mini conversation  

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,960
challenge. I want to help you be able to 
grow your confidence. When you can speak  

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,600
English confidently, the world opens up to you.
So let's get started. But before we do, I want  

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,920
to let you know that to help you with this lesson, 
I have created a free PDF guide with all of these  

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,360
expressions, all of the questions, and the sample 
conversation so that you can master this topic.  

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,360
You can print it out, put it under your 
pillow, sleep on it, whatever you need  

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,040
to do to really feel confident in English.
All right, let's get started with some common  

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,240
expressions to talk about birthdays. Let's 
talk about some types of birthday parties.  

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,840
A birthday bash, this is a big party, 
lots of people, lots of presents, lots of  

17
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,080
games. It's a big one. So you might say we're 
throwing a birthday bash for my niece because  

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,680
she's turning 10, double digits, quite exciting. 
To throw a party. Are you holding the party and  

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,560
throwing it? No. I mean, maybe you're throwing 
some confetti, but this is just another way to  

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:02,160
say we're having a party or we're going to plan a 
party. We often use the verb to throw. You might  

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:09,199
say we're throwing a party for my grandma's 90th 
birthday. It's going to be a big birthday bash. 

22
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:15,760
What if you're not a fan of birthday bashes? You 
want to keep things more low key. You might say  

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,160
a gathering or a get together. This is something 
small and intimate, just family, a few friends  

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,160
maybe. You could say I'm not a fan of big birthday 
bashes, so we're just going to have a little  

25
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,680
gathering at my house, or we're just going to 
have a little get together at my house. This is  

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,080
true for me. Usually for my birthday we just have 
a little get together at my house with a couple  

27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:46,960
of friends, maybe some family, nothing too big.
Surprise. Oh, what did I just do? I surprised  

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,920
you because it's a surprise party. Usually with 
a surprise party, the person who is having the  

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,000
birthday doesn't know about the party, this is 
the ideal situation. So someone is planning,  

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,640
inviting guests, setting up everything, and they 
try to get the birthday person to come into that  

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,720
area without knowing anything and they walk in 
and then everybody jumps up and says surprise. 

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,600
So I'm curious. Have you ever 
had a surprise birthday for you?  

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,880
Have you ever helped to participate in a surprise 
birthday? I don't think that I ever have, but  

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,280
one time when I was in college, my friends 
threw a surprise birthday party for me  

35
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,680
and another friend who has the same birthday, and 
I didn't want to go. I'm studying, I have a test.  

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,160
I can't go down there now. I'm not going to go 
have dinner with you guys. No, I'm... I need to  

37
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,440
study. And then one of my friends finally realized 
that I wasn't coming. And she said, "Hey, Vanessa,  

38
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,440
it's a surprise birthday for you. Come on." So 
I kind of had no choice at that point because I  

39
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,320
realized, "Oh, they're doing something nice for 
me." So you might say we're throwing a party for  

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,160
Vanessa, it's a surprise party. Don't tell 
her. Well, unless you can't get her to come. 

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,200
Next, let's talk about some common phrases 
that are just associated with birthdays.  

42
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,640
The first one is RSVP. Now this is occasionally 
something that we use in spoken conversation,  

43
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,280
but it is more common on a written invitation. 
It could be a physical invitation, or it might be  

44
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,960
an internet invitation using Facebook events 
or something like this. But RSVP stands for the  

45
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,680
French repondez s'il vous plait. It means please 
respond. Please tell me if you're coming. So  

46
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:48,560
usually you will see this sentence, RSVP by June 
30th, RSVP by Saturday whatever date. So there's  

47
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,080
a deadline. Please tell me if you're coming 
so that I can order the right amount of cake,  

48
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:00,960
so that I can make the right amount of food. This 
is just a polite thing to do to RSVP. Wonderful. 

49
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,200
Another common phrase for birthdays or 
for parties is BYOB. What if I said dinner  

50
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:17,680
and cake are provided. BYOB. What would 
that mean to you? Bring your old bag?  

51
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:30,160
Bring your old balloon? No, This means bring your 
own beer or bring your own booze. Booze is a slang  

52
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,160
term for alcohol. So this means I am not 
providing alcohol. If you want to drink alcohol,  

53
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,720
bring what you want to drink. Bring it for 
yourself. This is very common and it's not  

54
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,800
really rude. In fact, it's good to tell guests if 
they are allowed to drink alcohol at your house  

55
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,520
and you're not going to provide any, it's good to 
tell them I don't have any, bring your own. BYOB.  

56
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,040
This is quite a common expression, especially 
in an invitation you might see that written.  

57
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:06,000
Dinner and cake provided. BYOB. Excellent.
Make a wish. Usually after we sing Happy  

58
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Birthday, you blow out the candles and you 
close your eyes and you make a wish. There's  

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
kind of a superstition that if you tell people 
your wish, it will never come true. So usually  

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,520
it's a surprise. I will never tell you what my 
birthday wishes are because it probably won't  

61
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,000
come true then. This is kind of a superstition. 
But you might say, after I blow out the candles,  

62
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,120
I'm going to make a wish. But often you will hear 
people say this, so after they sing Happy Birthday  

63
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,080
and you blow out the candles, someone will say, 
all right, make a wish. And they're telling you  

64
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,600
this is the time to make a wish. This sometimes 
happens at children's parties more often that  

65
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:53,200
someone will say it. So they're reminding their 
child this is the time to make a wish, close  

66
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:59,440
your eyes and make a wish. Don't tell anyone. 
This is a fun little tradition I would say. 

67
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,880
A goodie bag. This is like a little 
plastic bag of, in my opinion, usually junk  

68
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,560
that is given to all of the kids at a children's 
birthday party. I'm not a big fan of goodie bags  

69
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,440
because they're usually made up of junk, it's 
stuff that comes from the dollar store and  

70
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,680
parents feel some kind of social pressure to give 
out a goodie bag at their child's birthday party,  

71
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,000
but usually those things just end up in the 
trash. So for me, I would rather do a craft at the  

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,200
birthday and the children can take home the craft 
or maybe there's an extra cupcake and the children  

73
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,320
can take home a cupcake. This seems a little 
bit better to me. I think that the idea of a  

74
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:47,040
goodie bag is falling out of tradition a bit, but 
there's still a little pressure to give something  

75
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,760
to your guests, this is only for children's 
birthdays, to give something to your guests. 

76
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,920
A sweet 16. If I said, I can't believe your 
daughter is already old enough to have her  

77
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:06,000
sweet 16. How old do you think that she is? 
Sixteen years old. For some reason, 16 is a  

78
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,640
big number. I think this is because this is when 
you can get your driver's license in the US,  

79
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:19,520
so it's usually just for girls. I hate to say 
it, but usually teenage boys who are 16 years old  

80
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,240
aren't usually labeled as sweet. Maybe that 
was just my experience when I was a teenager,  

81
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,760
but usually a 16-year-old girl might 
have a sweet 16 party. And this is a  

82
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:38,640
big birthday bash to celebrate turning 16.
The next big birthday is turning 21. And  

83
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,880
this is for anyone, boys or girls. And this is 
a big birthday because you can finally legally  

84
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,240
drink alcohol. So a lot of people will have 
a 21st birthday party with their friends  

85
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,520
where they get to go to a bar or they go to 
a pub or they go to a brewery or a restaurant  

86
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,200
and they get to drink alcohol in public. That's 
not to say that nobody drinks alcohol before 21,  

87
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,040
but usually your 21st birthday is kind of a 
symbol of now I am an adult. There you go. 

88
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,200
After 21, you have to wait a long 
time for your next big birthday.  

89
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,760
If I said, I don't feel that old, but 
somehow I'm already over the hill.  

90
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,120
What do you think over the hill means? Well, 
the average life span is about 80 years,  

91
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,200
I think now it's a little bit more than 
80 years old, but what is halfway? Forty. 

92
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,680
So this birthday is a little bit 
dark, a little bit depressing,  

93
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:43,040
but we say that when you turn 40 years old, you 
are over the hill, and any time after 40, if you  

94
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,840
don't want to tell someone your age, you can just 
say I'm over the hill or I'm way over the hill,  

95
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,840
because you are past the peak of life and 
now you're just going down the other side,  

96
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,240
very sad. So usually if you go to the grocery 
store and you buy any kind of balloons or  

97
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:12,080
birthday bags or birthday decorations for a 40th 
birthday, they all are black or gray or have to do  

98
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,680
with like gravestones or skeletons. It's very... 
it's a little bit silly because obviously when  

99
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,840
you're 40, you're still young, but it's just 
this silly idea that now you're over the hill. 

100
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,280
Our last birthday expression, before we get 
to some common birthday questions is a trip  

101
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:35,200
around the sun. This is just another fun way to 
say that you're one year older. So if somebody  

102
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,040
is having a birthday, you could tell them 
congrats on another successful trip around the  

103
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,720
sun. They have successfully gone around the sun 
one more time, which is one more year. Congrats  

104
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,240
on a successful trip around the sun. You did it.
All right, let's go onto some common questions  

105
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,080
that you might get asked on your birthday or 
you could ask someone else on their birthday  

106
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,680
and we'll talk about some common answers 
as well. Any plans for your birthday?  

107
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,760
This is an extremely common question. If someone 
asks you any plans for your birthday? You could  

108
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,480
say, yep, we're planning a big bash this weekend. 
It's going to be exciting. Or no, we're just  

109
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,360
going to have a small gathering with a couple of 
friends. Excellent. Any plans for your birthday? 

110
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,680
What do you want to do for your birthday? This is 
a great question to ask if you know that you will  

111
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,600
also be included in the birthday plans. If you 
are a family member or a close friend who will  

112
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:38,880
help to organize the birthday activities, you can 
use this question. What do you want to do for your  

113
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,880
birthday? That kind of is asking, hey, what should 
I plan for your birthday? And you could say,  

114
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,560
yeah, I'd like to have just a small get together 
at the house. Maybe we can have a cookout, maybe  

115
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,840
some cake, just some kind of small get together.
A little bird told me it was your birthday.  

116
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:03,920
What would you like? This expression, a little 
bird told me, is kind of almost a universal idea  

117
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I think. A lot of languages have this concept of 
hearing something from a little bird. You're not  

118
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,920
saying who told you, but you're just saying a 
little bird told me that it was your birthday  

119
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,720
or that your birthday is coming soon. Do you have 
this type of expression in your native language?  

120
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,920
It's a great one to use for birthdays. You could 
just say a little bird told me it's your birthday.  

121
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,800
What would you like? You're asking for a present 
idea. What kind of present should I give you?  

122
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,600
And an answer to that could be, yep, 
my birthday is coming up on Saturday,  

123
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,880
but instead of a present I'm asking that everyone 
bring some kind of food or drink to the party.  

124
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,840
Okay. You don't need presents, you don't need 
more stuff. You're just asking that people bring  

125
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,480
food and drinks to your party. Simple. And it's 
a good way to give at a party and participate. 

126
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,480
How old will you be? Or maybe if it's on 
someone's birthday, oh, how old are you now?  

127
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:13,600
Don't ask an adult this. I would say after the age 
of 21, usually it's not a good idea to ask someone  

128
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,000
how old are you or how old will you be. In 
American culture, it is quite rude to ask  

129
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,680
someone their age when they're an adult. For a 
child, it's no problem. Children love telling  

130
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,520
people their age. Usually they're very specific, 
like I'm seven and a half, I'm eight and three  

131
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,840
quarters. They're very specific about their age 
because they're so proud of it. But once we become  

132
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,600
adults, we become a little bit more hesitant 
to share our age, especially with anybody.  

133
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:50,400
And it's not required in social circumstances to 
say your age. So I recommend asking how old are  

134
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,240
you now, or how old will you be only to children.
When someone invites you to a party, you can ask  

135
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,840
is it a surprise party? That way you can 
not be the one who spoils the surprise.  

136
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,240
So maybe they forgot to tell you, oh, it's a 
surprise party. So it's a good thing to ask  

137
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,520
is this a surprise party? And they might say, 
oh no, he knows about it. Or he might say,  

138
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,120
oh yes, it is. Don't tell him. It's a great 
question to ask. Is it a surprise party? 

139
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,640
Do you need me to bring anything? Can I bring 
anything? This is a great question to ask any time  

140
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,960
that you go to someone's house for dinner, for a 
meal, for even just tea or coffee, and especially  

141
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:35,200
for a birthday party or a holiday gathering, it's 
great to ask do you need me to bring anything,  

142
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,840
or what can I bring? I ask this all the time and 
I really appreciate it when my guests ask this,  

143
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,560
because maybe it would be nice if someone else 
made the salad or someone else made a dish for  

144
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,800
the meal or maybe even someone just brought 
a game or something to do. This can help to  

145
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,720
ease the burden of the person who is throwing 
the party or just having a holiday gathering. 

146
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,720
So this is a great question to ask, I highly 
recommend it. And if someone asks you,  

147
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,320
oh, can I bring anything? You can think, 
okay, well, yeah, maybe bring your own booze.  

148
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,400
Or, yeah, do you have a favorite board game? Maybe 
after dinner we could play a game. Bring a game.  

149
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,800
Or could you make a salad? Could you make a 
dessert? Not even make, could you just bring  

150
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,560
one? You can buy it, that's okay. But this kind 
of question can help to have everyone feel like  

151
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,160
they're participating in the evening.
All right, now that we've practiced  

152
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,160
some common expressions for birthdays, 
some common questions for birthdays,  

153
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,840
let's go on to our conversation. I'd like you 
to see this sample conversation that I had with  

154
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,560
my husband, Dan, about birthdays. You're going 
to recognize a lot of these questions, a lot of  

155
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,600
the expressions about birthdays. Listen to this 
conversation carefully because in just a minute,  

156
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,080
Dan will leave and I will be asking you those 
questions and it will be your turn to speak out  

157
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,680
loud. Let's watch the sample conversation.
Hey Dan. 

158
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,600
Dan:
Hey Vanessa. You have a  

159
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,520
birthday coming up, don't you?
Vanessa: 

160
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,040
Yeah. Pretty soon. Another trip around the sun.
Dan: 

161
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,920
Cool. Do you have any plans for your birthday?
Vanessa: 

162
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,400
Yeah. I'm going to have a big birthday bash. 
I would love for you to come. I can send you  

163
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,520
an invitation.
Dan: 

164
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,240
That sounds fun. Do you need me to bring anything? 

165
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,320
Vanessa:
You can bring your  

166
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,640
favorite party game and a big appetite for cake. 
All the other details will be in the invitation. 

167
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Dan:
Sounds great. I'll be there. 

168
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,600
Vanessa:
Great. See you then. 

169
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,840
Okay. You watched the sample 
conversation. Now it's time to  

170
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,640
take a deep breath and practice this yourself. 
I'm going to ask you a couple questions and  

171
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,920
I will pause, I will be listening to you. 
No matter where you live around the world,  

172
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,760
I will be listening and we will be having this 
conversation. If it seems too fast for you,  

173
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,880
if you want to try it again, the good news 
is that you can click pause on the video  

174
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,560
and go back and practice it again. No 
problem. Are you ready? Let's get started. 

175
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,280
Hey, a little bird told me that your 
birthday is coming up. Do you have any plans?  

176
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,439
That sounds like fun. Is it a birthday 
tradition or is that something new?  

177
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,840
Cool. I would love to come. Can I bring anything?  

178
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,680
Great. I'll be there. I can't wait to 
celebrate another trip around the sun. 

179
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,760
So how did you do with this little sample 
conversation? I hope that it was a good challenge  

180
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,200
for you and it helped to boost your confidence 
speaking in English. That is the goal. You can  

181
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,640
always go back and review this. So now I have 
a question for you. Let me know in the comments  

182
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,320
when is your birthday. If you want to tell me just 
the month, that's fine. The month and the day,  

183
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,760
that's fine. Just the year, that's fine. 
Or all of it, go ahead. It's your choice.
