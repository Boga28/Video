00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,660
Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:06,670
Are you ready to speak with me?

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,860
Let's do it.

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:14,700
Vanessa:
Hey, what's your feeling for dinner tonight?

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,820
You want to grab something to go, or you want
to eat out?

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,320
Huh?

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,769
If I asked you this, would you know how to
respond, or would your heart start beating

8
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:27,470
quickly and you think, "What do I say?"

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,760
Well, never fear.

10
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,580
In today's lesson, we're going to talk about
some common questions that are often asked

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,830
in conversations about restaurants or eating
out, deciding what you want to eat, and also

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,030
some common responses to this so that you
can feel confident in your next interactions.

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,630
Vanessa:
At the end of this lesson, you'll have a chance

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,000
to speak with me and practice what you've
learned.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,490
So make sure to listen carefully.

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,940
Let's start with some common questions for
talking about eating out in restaurants.

17
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:04,140
Since the pandemic began, a lot of restaurants
have changed their service model.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,110
These questions will cover eating in a restaurant,
but also ordering food to go.

19
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,400
I hope that these will help you in any situation
that you're in.

20
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,290
Let's start with our first question.

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,360
Do you want to eat?

22
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,670
Out this phrasal verb "to eat out" means at
a restaurant.

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,390
Vanessa:
We don't often say, "Do you want to go to

24
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,410
a restaurant?

25
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,060
Do you want to eat at a restaurant?"

26
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,340
We just say "eat out."

27
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,370
Do you want to eat out?

28
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,110
But we often reduce this question to sound
a little more comfortable and casual.

29
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,180
Ya want to eat out?

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,370
Ya is you.

31
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,530
You want to eat out?

32
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,400
Ya want to eat out?

33
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,610
We've dropped the question word completely
do.

34
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,299
Just ya, ya.

35
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:53,320
And then we have reduced want to to become
wanna.

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,690
This is a common reduction in English.

37
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,180
Can you say this question with me?

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,140
Ya want to eat out?

39
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,790
Ya want to eat out?

40
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,799
Or we could cut off that first word ya completely
and just say, "Wanna eat out?"

41
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,080
Vanessa:
Ask it with me.

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,239
Wanna eat out?

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,239
Great.

44
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,159
Then you might ask, where do you want to go?

45
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,159
Where do you want to go?

46
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,269
But do you think we say it clearly like this?

47
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:18,840
Unfortunately not.

48
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,859
Instead, you could say, "Where ya wanna go?"

49
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:26,130
Where ya wanna go?

50
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,969
This is a similar reduction to our first question.

51
00:02:28,969 --> 00:02:34,790
You becomes ya and want to becomes wanna.

52
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,540
Where ya wanna go?

53
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,700
Where ya wanna go?

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,359
Where ya wanna go?

55
00:02:40,359 --> 00:02:42,689
Should we order pick up?

56
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:43,689
Should we order pickup?

57
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:49,700
I want to let you know that in the US there
are a lot of terms that are used for this

58
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,989
idea that you're not eating in the restaurant.

59
00:02:52,989 --> 00:02:55,480
Vanessa:
You're ordering food, but then you get the

60
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,319
food and you take it somewhere else.

61
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,260
Maybe you take it back home or you take it
to a park.

62
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,829
We could use a couple of different phrases,
and it's just your personal preference.

63
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,919
For me, I say pick up.

64
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,299
Do you want to order pick up?

65
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:08,909
Do you want to get pick up?

66
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:13,209
But you could also say, should we order take
out?

67
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,590
Should we order carry out?

68
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,090
Should we order take-away?

69
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,190
So a lot of different phrases and you are
going to hear these all around the US.

70
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,019
It's just your choice what you'd like to use.

71
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:26,659
Vanessa:
Another fun question to ask what someone would

72
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:31,199
like to eat is, what are you in the mood for?

73
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,079
What are you in the mood for?

74
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,540
Don't deny it.

75
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,719
Sometimes in your heart you're just in the
mood for comfort food.

76
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:45,730
Something that's heavy and rich and reminds
you of a cozy, warm time in your childhood.

77
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,299
Maybe it's not very healthy, but you're in
the mood for comfort food, or maybe you're

78
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:52,650
in the mood for something light.

79
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,480
You want a salad or sushi.

80
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,680
Something light.

81
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,290
This idea of what are you feeling like you
want to eat, but we often reduce this question.

82
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,069
And instead of saying, "What are you in the
mood for?"

83
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,120
Vanessa:
We might say, "Whatcha in the mood for?"

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:16,279
Whatcha, whatcha is what are you, whatcha
in the mood for?

85
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,339
Here, the word you has been reduced to cha,
cha.

86
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,500
This is extremely common in spoken English
that the word you gets changed up in a lot

87
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
of ways.

88
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,830
We already talked about one of those, ya,
and this is another, cha.

89
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,340
Whatcha in the mood for?

90
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,630
Whatcha in the mood for?

91
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,949
Or we could reduce this even further, wha'ya
in the mood for?

92
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,310
Wha'ya in the mood for?

93
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:41,819
This is extremely reduced, but notice what's
happening.

94
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:44,310
What are you in the mood for?

95
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,580
The word R is gone and the word you has been
reduced to ya.

96
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,720
Vanessa:
So when we linked together what and you, it's

97
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,759
super fast.

98
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,710
Wha'ya in the mood for?

99
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,310
Wha'ya in the mood for?

100
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,389
You don't want to say this reduction slowly,
wha'ya in the mood for?

101
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:04,389
No.

102
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:06,470
We can say it like that to practice for this
lesson.

103
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,770
But when this is in daily conversation, it's
really fast.

104
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,729
That's the purpose of a reduction.

105
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,169
Do you think you could say this with me really
fast?

106
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:15,569
Wha'ya in the mood for?

107
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:17,070
Wha'ya in the mood for?

108
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,759
Wha'ya in the mood for?

109
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,759
Great.

110
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,759
All right.

111
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,120
Let's talk about some common answers to these
questions so that you can be prepared and

112
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
ready.

113
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,939
Vanessa:
When someone asks you wha'ya in the mood for,

114
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,500
you might say, "Let's order in.

115
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,909
How about some option?

116
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,919
How about pizza?"

117
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,229
Let's order in.

118
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:41,199
This is another phrase for talking about bringing
the food back to your house.

119
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,500
You don't want to get all ready and then go
to the restaurant, or maybe you don't feel

120
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,689
comfortable doing that.

121
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:50,569
So you might just say, "Let's order in.

122
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:51,990
How about pizza?"

123
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,129
This expression, how about, is a great way
to give a suggestion.

124
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:59,819
Vanessa:
This is excellent in professional situations,

125
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:05,830
"Hey, how about if we try this marketing plan,"
or it's great for informal situations to give

126
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,940
a suggestion about something you want to eat,
"How about pizza?

127
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,310
What do you think about that?"

128
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,349
Sometimes this question is reduced and it
sounds like this, "How 'bout pizza?"

129
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,439
How 'bout pizza?

130
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,289
The first A in the word about is gone.

131
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:24,919
Hmm, it's just missing.

132
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:28,069
We say, "How 'bout pizza?"

133
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:30,219
Can you say that reduction quickly with me?

134
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:32,740
How 'bout pizza?How 'bout pizza?

135
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
Great.

136
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,330
Or you could say, "I'm feeling tacos.

137
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,699
Does that sound good?"

138
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,889
Vanessa:
So you're giving your opinion, you'd like

139
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:41,950
to eat tacos.

140
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,069
But you also want to know what the other person
wants, so you use a great question, does that

141
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,099
sound good?

142
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:50,389
But we often reduce this a lot.

143
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:52,409
So let's take a look at the first reduction.

144
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:58,599
You might say, "I'm feelin'," cutting off
that G, "I'm feelin' tacos.

145
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:00,880
How'zat sound?"

146
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,160
How'zat sound?

147
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:10,280
Instead of, how does that sound, you can say
how'zat, how'zat sound?

148
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,159
How'zat sound?

149
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,919
Can you say that quickly with me?

150
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,289
I'm feelin' tacos.

151
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:16,610
How'zat sound?

152
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,889
I'm feelin' tacos.

153
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:18,949
How'zat sound?

154
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:19,949
Great.

155
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:22,120
We can also reduce it and switch it up a little
bit.

156
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,849
Vanessa:
I'm feelin' tacos.

157
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:25,180
Zat sound okay?

158
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,259
I'm feelin' tacos.

159
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:29,960
That's what I want, but I want to know your
opinion.

160
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:35,710
Does that sound okay reduces to zat sound
okay?

161
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:39,080
Does that becomes zat.

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
Zat sound okay?

163
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,289
Zat sound okay?

164
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:42,389
Can you say it with me?

165
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:43,389
I'm feelin' tacos.

166
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:45,009
Zat sound okay?

167
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:46,289
Great question.

168
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,800
Because a lot of restaurants have changed
over the last year and you never know when

169
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,499
a restaurant might be closed, it's a good
question to ask, is Ted's Cafe open?

170
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,460
I would love to go there.

171
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,729
Is some restaurant open?

172
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:01,831
I would love to go there.

173
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:05,050
There is a little way that we can reduce this
question.

174
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,370
Vanessa:
Take a look at this.

175
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,610
Is Ted's Cafe open?

176
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,650
I'd love to go there.

177
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,090
The word would becomes I'd.

178
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,289
I would, I'd.

179
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,620
You can say, "Is Ted's Cafe open?

180
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,080
I'd love to go there."

181
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,199
Can you say it with me?

182
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,629
Is Ted's Cafe open?

183
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,080
I'd love to go there.

184
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
Great.

185
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,370
In the US, a lot of restaurants are having
outdoor seating.

186
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,789
So you could say, "Let's go to Louie's, a
restaurant name, Louie's.

187
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,049
Let's go to Louie's and eat lunch on their
patio.

188
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:39,168
Eat lunch on their patio.

189
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,640
This is like an outdoor dining area.

190
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,169
Vanessa:
It's really nice when restaurants have this,

191
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:48,360
because sometimes you don't feel like eating
at home, but especially with kids, if you

192
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,850
don't feel like confining them inside a restaurant,
or maybe you don't feel comfortable doing

193
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,850
that.

194
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,410
If a restaurant has a patio, it's more informal
feeling, and it's kind of a nice spur of the

195
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,750
moment thing to do.

196
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,890
A great expression that you can use is, let's
grab a bite at Louie's.

197
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's grab a bite at Ted's Cafe.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,050
To grab a bite is usually a quick meal.

199
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,590
It might be lunch.

200
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:18,400
Usually it's not dinner because it's pretty
quick, but it might just be a short experience.

201
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,310
Vanessa:
It's not a long dinner.

202
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,900
It's not a big to do.

203
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,900
Let's grab a bite at Ted's Cafe because I
have to go somewhere later.

204
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,780
Let's grab a bite at somewhere else.

205
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,200
Can you say that with me?

206
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,090
Let's grab a bite at Ted's Cafe.

207
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,300
Let's grab a bite.

208
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:39,590
Our final answer to the question, what you
want to eat, is, I know a place, or I know

209
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,320
a spot that has great pasta.

210
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,160
I know a place that has great pizza.

211
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,160
I know a place.

212
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,930
You could leave this simple and just say,
"I know a place.

213
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,930
Come with me."

214
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,440
Vanessa:
But if you want to be a little less mysterious,

215
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,720
you could just say, "Oh, I know a place that
has great pasta.

216
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,280
Come with me and you've got to try it."

217
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:03,140
This is kind of maybe an unknown restaurant
location that not many people know about,

218
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,710
and it's a great phrase to use.

219
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,710
Oh, I know a place that you're going to love.

220
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,710
Excellent.

221
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,850
Are you ready to practice these.

222
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,620
First, I would like you to watch the sample
conversation between my husband and I, as

223
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,210
we talk about where we want to eat, what we
want to eat.

224
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,790
Think about those phrases.

225
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,600
Notice the phrases that we use.

226
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,820
Vanessa:
And then after that, you're going to have

227
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,300
a chance to speak out loud and practice it
yourself.

228
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,490
Let's watch the sample conversation.

229
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,890
Vanessa:
Hey, you want to grab lunch?

230
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,890
Dan:
Sure, but I only have time for a quick bite

231
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,640
before my soccer game.

232
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
What sounds good?

233
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,670
Vanessa:
Hmm, how about pasta?

234
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,620
Dan:
That sounds great.

235
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,760
How about I call it in, you pick it up, and
we'll pick Nick in the park before my game

236
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
starts.

237
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,060
Vanessa:
That sounds great.

238
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,150
I know a place that's close by and has great
tomato sauce.

239
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,560
Vanessa:
All right.

240
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,090
Now, it's your turn.

241
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,060
I want you to use these phrases that you've
learned.

242
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,550
I'm going to ask you a question.

243
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,160
We're going to have a little conversation
together.

244
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,470
It's your chance to speak out loud.

245
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,190
I'm going to ask a question and pause.

246
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,630
Wait for your answer.

247
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,470
No matter where you are around the world,
I will be listening to you.

248
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,580
Please take this opportunity to speak and
use what you've learned.

249
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,440
If you need to repeat this section again and
again, do that.

250
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,290
It's a great way to gain confidence as you
speak.

251
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,520
Are you ready?

252
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,740
Hey, I'm hungry.

253
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,030
Let's grab lunch.

254
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,330
Whatcha in the mood for?

255
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,330
Vanessa:
Oh, that sounds good.

256
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,910
Do you know a good place?

257
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:41,640
Oh, that sounds good.

258
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,000
Do you wanna eat there or get take-out?

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Great.

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,030
Let's go.

261
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,440
Well, how did you do?

262
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,850
Do you feel a little more confident discussing
dining options and talking about eating out?

263
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,410
I hope so.

264
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,580
I want you to let me know in the comments.

265
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,250
Right now in your country, can you order take
out?

266
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,070
Is this a possibility?

267
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,690
Let me know in the comments and I can't wait
to see your answers.

268
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,520

me, and I'll see you again next Friday for

269

271
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,990
