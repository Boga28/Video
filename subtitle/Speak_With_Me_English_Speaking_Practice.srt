Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.  

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,360
I have some good news. I'm coming 
to visit you. Let's talk about it. 

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,040
I can't wait. I just booked my flight. I've 
got everything set up. I can't wait to hear  

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,600
more about where you live. What should I see? 
What places should I avoid? Tell me all about.  

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,640
Is your heart starting to beat, tell you 
about where I live? What? What do I say? How  

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,960
do I explain it? Well, don't worry. Today in this 
lesson, I'm going to help you talk about where you  

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,200
live and also you will have a chance to speak with 
me and use what you've learned. In this lesson,  

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,560
you will learn some common vocabulary to talk 
about where you live. You can accurately explain  

9
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,000
where you live and give some advice to people who 
could be visiting your city. Then we'll talk about  

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,640
some common conversation questions about where you 
live. And finally, you will see a little sample  

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,600
conversation between my husband, Dan and I, as 
we talk about visiting another city, and then you  

12
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,160
will have a chance to practice speaking with 
me. I will ask you a question and you will  

13
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,680
need to use what you've learned. So pay attention 
well, and get ready for the end of this lesson. 

14
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,400
To help you with today's lesson. I have created a 
free PDF worksheet with all of today's vocabulary,  

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,240
questions, tips, sample conversations, and 
Vanessa's challenge question at the end of  

16
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,360
the PDF worksheet so that you can use what 
you've learned and remember it so that you  

17
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,320
don't feel too nervous and you can express 
yourself clearly. So don't forget to download  

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,320
the free PDF worksheet. There is a link in the 
description of this video. It is my gift for you. 

19
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,800
Okay, let's get started with some common 
vocabulary to talk about where you live. 

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:59,600
If you live in a city, you might say, "It's really 
busy where I live. New York city is a busy place."  

21
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,840
Or you could use the word crowded. "Tokyo is a 
crowded city. There are lots of people everywhere,  

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,920
and there are not many places where you can be 
alone and have a quiet moment." Maybe you might  

23
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,280
say that your city is busy and crowded. What's 
the opposite of this? You can say, "Stockholm,  

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,520
Sweden is a relaxed city. It's a quiet place." 
I don't know. I have never been to Stockholm.  

25
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,120
If you're from Stockholm, Sweden, let me know.  

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,560
But you might say, "Where I live is just a relaxed 
place." Or we can say it's relaxing. "If you  

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,360
come visit where I live, it's very relaxing and 
quiet. Maybe that's because it's in the country." 

28
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,440
Let's go on to these two common words to 
talk about the type of place you live.  

29
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,840
You might say, "Yeah, I live in Delhi, India, and 
it's one of the largest urban areas in the. There  

30
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,400
are so many people here. It's busy, it's crowded. 
It's an urban area." And this means it's the city.  

31
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,920
It's quite busy. It's crowded. It's an urban 
area. There's not many trees, not much nature.  

32
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,440
But on the other hand, you might say, "I live 
in the country." The word country means United  

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:27,920
States, France, Japan, these places, but in the 
US, we use this to mean countryside. We do say  

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,680
countryside sometimes, but we're more likely in 
the US to say, "I live in the country." That means  

35
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,880
in nature. Maybe there's some farms around you, 
maybe there's forests around you and you don't  

36
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,240
live in a busy urban city center. You live in the 
country. So I wonder for you, do you live in the  

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:54,480
country or do you live in an urban city center?
Do you live somewhere that's difficult to get  

38
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,520
to? You might say, "Yeah, my city is off the 
beaten path, but it's worth visiting." So for me,  

39
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,920
my city, Asheville in North Carolina, it is 
definitely off the beaten path. It's not a huge  

40
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,480
city. It doesn't have a big airport that comes 
here. It's off the beaten path. But if you want  

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,720
to check out some other local sites in the US, it 
could be nice to visit. It's off the beaten path. 

42
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,400
This also can be used to talk 
about locations within a city.  

43
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,000
So if you visit Paris and you go to the 
Eiffel Tower, and then you get hungry. Well,  

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,720
the places that are close to the Eiffel Tower 
to eat, those are what we call tourist traps.  

45
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,880
Those places are only for tourists. They're 
extremely expensive. They're not high quality.  

46
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,920
It's just to trap tourists. But if you want to 
eat at a great location, you might go somewhere  

47
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,480
off the beaten path. This is somewhere that not 
many other people go to. And it's an expression  

48
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:04,560
that's great to use about like little secret local 
locations. So when I visit your city, I might ask,  

49
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,520
"Are there any places off the beaten path that 
I can visit? Are there any restaurants off the  

50
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,840
beaten path that only locals know about? What 
is something off the beaten path that I can do?" 

51
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Let's say that where you live is not extremely 
popular, but it's becoming more popular.  

52
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:29,680
Maybe because of the pandemic last year, people 
are traveling to different types of destinations.  

53
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,560
Maybe they're deciding to travel to 
more nature places, places that are  

54
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,720
in the mountains or places that are not in big 
city centers. Well, that might mean that where  

55
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,400
you live is becoming an up and coming place. 
We use this term, up and coming, to talk about  

56
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,440
somewhere that's not extremely popular, but it's 
becoming more popular. So you might say, "Yeah,  

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,200
my city isn't really popular now, but it's an up 
and coming place, you've got to check it out." We  

58
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,720
can use this on a smaller scale, just like off 
the beaten path, to talk about a restaurant or  

59
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,120
a neighborhood. "That neighborhood used to not be 
a good neighborhood, but now it's an up and coming  

60
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,480
neighborhood. You've got to walk through it. Just 
look at the houses, look at the architecture,  

61
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,480
enjoy the sites." So you might say, "It's an 
up and coming place." Excellent expression. 

62
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:34,320
Our final expression to talk about where you 
live is must-see, or some must-see locations.  

63
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,200
Can you imagine what this means? Does it mean 
it's not important to see it? No. You can skip  

64
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:47,840
that. No, you must see this. For example, when 
you visit Egypt, the pyramids are a must-see.  

65
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,920
So we can use it as a noun. A must-See. Of course, 
when you go to Egypt, the pyramids are a must-see.  

66
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:03,440
When you go to London, Big Ben is a must-see. When 
you go to New York City, the Empire State Building  

67
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,040
is a must-see. These are kind of like the top 
things that you need to see. But even if you don't  

68
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,320
live in one of those really popular cities, if you 
live somewhere a little bit off the beaten path,  

69
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,160
you can still use this expression. You might 
say, "In my city, this view on the top of the  

70
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,920
mountains, that is a must-see. You drive up 
this hill and you can have a great 360 view.  

71
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,120
That is a must-see." So it's something that 
you cannot miss when you visit that location. 

72
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,080
So when I visit your city, tell 
me what are some places that  

73
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,280
are a must-see? I don't want to miss them.
Next, let's talk about some common questions  

74
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,640
that you can ask other people about where 
they live and also other people will ask you  

75
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:51,280
about where you live. So make sure you're 
comfortable answering them about where you live. 

76
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,640
The first question is, where are you from? This 
is an extremely common question. And you can  

77
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,640
just say, "Yep. I'm from the US." But it's nice to 
give a little more details. So you might say, "I'm  

78
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,880
from Asheville in North Carolina. It's a pretty 
quiet place, but it's kind of up and coming."  

79
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,200
Great. You're giving some details. It's 
quiet, but it's also up and coming. I live  

80
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,280
in Asheville. You're inviting a conversation. 
If you just say, "I'm from the US." Or,  

81
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,320
"I'm from Asheville." That's where I'm from. 
Someone might ask you, "What's it like there?"  

82
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,960
Or if someone doesn't give you more details 
about where they live, they just say France.  

83
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,360
"I live in London. I live in LA." Okay, well, 
you might want some more details. You don't want  

84
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,600
to continue the conversation. This is a great 
question to ask: what's it like there? What's  

85
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,360
it like there? What is it like there? They might 
say, "It's so hot in the summer, but in the fall,  

86
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,800
it's awesome because we get some great leaves and 
you got to check it out in the fall." Excellent. 

87
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
If someone has not mentioned the weather yet, 
you can say, "What's the weather like there?"  

88
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,840
They can go into some details. You could say about 
your city. "The winter is so cold. We get tons of  

89
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,080
snow, but when it melts in the spring and all of 
the leaves become green and the flowers bloom,  

90
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,880
it's awesome. You got to visit in the spring."
If you have not told someone what time to visit  

91
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,400
yet, they might ask, "What's the best time to 
visit?" When Dan and I were planning a trip to  

92
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,760
go to Costa Rica, a couple years ago, we did a 
lot of research about what is the best time to  

93
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,360
visit Costa Rica. Their seasons are very different 
than our seasons and we were going to be spending  

94
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
a lot of time outside. So we wanted to make 
sure it wasn't going to be raining the whole  

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,720
time, it wasn't going to be pouring down rain or 
too hot the whole time. So we asked this question,  

96
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,400
"When's the best time to visit?" So 
someone might ask you, "When's the  

97
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,360
best time to visit your city?" For my city, 
I think the best time to visit is the fall.  

98
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,320
The leaves are beautiful and the mountains. 
There's so many different colors and the air is so  

99
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,920
crisp and fresh. Got to visit in the fall.
If someone asked you, "What's your city known  

100
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,120
for?" What would you say? This means, what is your 
city famous for? Why do people visit your city?  

101
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,080
It might just be something simple 
like, "The air is so fresh."  

102
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,000
Or it might be, "Oh, they just love 
this pastry. This type of dessert  

103
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
that's made in my city and a lot of 
people like to come and eat that pastry."  

104
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,120
Cool. It could be something simple. Or if you live 
in a bigger place, you can obviously talk about  

105
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,960
some famous destinations that your city is known 
for. But if people have not heard about your city,  

106
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:40,640
they might ask this question, "Oh, what's 
it known for? What's your city known for?"  

107
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
And then you can think about some great places 
to visit that people might be interested in. 

108
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,120
Whenever I ask someone about their city, 
especially if I'm going to visit like your city,  

109
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,800
I like to ask about their personal favorite 
thing to do. So someone might ask you,  

110
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,280
"What's your favorite thing to do in your city?" 
Or, "What's your favorite thing to eat there?  

111
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,480
What's your favorite thing to see?" Because I 
think that local people's perspectives are often  

112
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,160
different than a tourist perspective. So finding 
out what the locals like to do, specifically what  

113
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,960
you like to do can be really valuable and can add 
to a rich visiting experience. So if I asked you,  

114
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,680
"What's your favorite thing to do in your city?" 
You might tell me, "Oh man, there is this little  

115
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,880
bar off the beaten path, down this alley, and you 
got to check it out. It's so cool. They brew their  

116
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,920
own beer and the atmosphere is awesome. It is a 
must-see." Great. I bet that my trip to your city  

117
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,440
would be a lot more amazing because of that 
information. So make sure that you have some ideas  

118
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,320
that you can tell other people about your city.
Our final question is a little more broad. Someone  

119
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,040
might simply ask you, "What do you recommend?" 
Or maybe if you're talking to someone who lives  

120
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,400
in New York and you are about to visit New York. 
Great, you can ask them some questions and say,  

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,160
"What do you recommend? What do you recommend 
about New York? What do you recommend that I do?" 

122
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,640
"Oh, you've got to see this museum. It's really 
cool. They have local artists that they have  

123
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,760
on display. All these different things you can 
see." Great, you're asking, what do you recommend  

124
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,720
in general? It might not be that person's absolute 
favorite thing personally, but to visit the city,  

125
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,280
what do you recommend? Great. A wonderful 
question to ask. What do you recommend? 

126
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,880
All right, now that we've talked about some 
common vocabulary to describe your city,  

127
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,000
some common questions that you can ask or other 
people might ask you about where you live,  

128
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,440
let's see a quick sample conversation between 
me and my husband, Dan, where we talk about  

129
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,920
visiting Rome. Now, neither of us are from 
Rome, but I want you to use your imagination.  

130
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,240
Let's imagine that Dan is from Rome. He's actually 
from the US, but let's imagine that he's from Rome  

131
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,600
and he is giving me some insider tips about what 
I should do on my upcoming trip to Rome. Let's  

132
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,560
watch the sample conversation and listen for some 
of the key vocabulary that we just talked about,  

133
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,920
because you are about to have a chance to use 
it yourself, speaking with me. Let's watch. 

134
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,800
Hey Dan.
Dan: 

135
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,760
Hey Vanessa. Are you excited 
for your trip to Rome? 

136
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,960
Vanessa:
Yeah, I can't wait. It's such a historic place,  

137
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,880
but are there any tourist traps I should avoid?
Dan: 

138
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,680
Yeah, avoid all the gelato shops except this 
one. It's off the beaten path, but trust me,  

139
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,520
it's worth it.
Vanessa: 

140
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,560
Oh, thanks for the tip. Any other must-sees?
Dan: 

141
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,680
Well, the Colosseum is great, but my favorite 
thing to do is wander around and see all the  

142
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,680
little chapels. It's usually more 
relaxed and less crowded that way. 

143
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Vanessa:
Oh, that's good to know. Thanks for the tip. 

144
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,520
Dan:
No problem. Enjoy your trip. 

145
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,160
Vanessa:
I will. 

146
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,440
All right, now it is your turn. I'm going to ask 
you some questions about where you live because  

147
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,160
I'm coming to visit. I need to know what it's 
like. I'm going to ask you some questions and then  

148
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:01,280
I will pause. I will be listening to you wherever 
you live around the world. I will be listening. So  

149
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,240
please speak out loud. Use the expressions that 
you have learned. And I can't wait to learn more  

150
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:12,080
about your city. Are you ready to get started?
Hi, I'm taking a vacation to your city and I  

151
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,000
can't wait. Tell me, what's the weather like in 
the summer? I need to know what I should pack. 

152
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,080
That's good to know. Thank you. Well, what's 
your favorite thing to do or see in your city? 

153
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,760
Well, that sounds really interesting. 
So I got to know, are there any tourist  

154
00:14:45,760 --> 00:15:01,920
traps that I should avoid when I go?
Thanks so much for the tip. I look forward  

155
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,000
to visiting. I can't wait to see you soon. Bye.
