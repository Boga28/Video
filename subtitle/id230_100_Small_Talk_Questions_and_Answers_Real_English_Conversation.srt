1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,110
- Hello lovely students

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,450
and welcome back to English with Lucy.

3
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,027
So many of my students

4
00:00:05,027 --> 00:00:08,039
want to improve their conversation skills,

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,380
but sometimes it can be really hard

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,586
to think of the right question to say,

7
00:00:12,586 --> 00:00:15,900
and it's even harder to
think of a good response

8
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,079
to keep conversation going.

9
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,539
If you want to keep a conversation going,

10
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:24,191
it's really important that
you ask open-ended questions.

11
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,780
This is a key part of small talk.

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,490
I really want to help you practise.

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:34,490
So today I have got 100
open-ended small talk questions.

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,341
Open-ended questions are
questions that people cannot reply

15
00:00:40,341 --> 00:00:42,336
yes or no to.

16
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:44,610
They have to say more than that.

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,570
I am going to be asked these 100 questions

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,000
and I am going to give you genuine answers

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,920
so you can learn from me.

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,780
And to help you even further,

21
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,320
I have created an e-book for this lesson

22
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,040
that you can download for free.

23
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,519
It contains all 100 questions.

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,660
It contains the full
transcript of my answers

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,311
with key vocabulary and a quiz.

26
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:17,311
It is the ultimate small
talk conversation e-book.

27
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:18,930
If you would like to download

28
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,146

along with my news updates and offers.

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,310
Right, let's get started with
the small talk questions.

38
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,630
I'm already nervous.

39
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,870
- [Will] First topic,
general small talk questions.

40
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,810
Question one, how was your day today?

41
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,670
- It's been pretty busy,

42
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,720
but I've had a good day.

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,620
Thanks.

44
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,170
- [Will] Two, what did
you do last weekend?

45
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,371
- Last weekend I visited
my family in Bedfordshire

46
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:04,560
and we celebrated my brother's birthday.

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,840
- [Will] Three, what hobbies or interests

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,030
do you have outside of work?

49
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,780
- I really like running, and
I've just bought a treadmill,

50
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,580
so I'm enjoying using that.

51
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,550
- [Will] Four, have you
watched any interesting movies

52
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,650
or TV shows recently?

53
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,600
- I've really been enjoying
watching "The White Lotus."

54
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,590
It's quite relaxing

55
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,020
because it's set in a holiday destination.

56
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,080
- [Will] Five, what type of music

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,520
do you enjoy listening to?

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,975
- I honestly don't
listen to a lot of music,

59
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:38,231
but I do really like Taylor Swift.

60
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:39,750
She always makes me smile.

61
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,508
- [Will] Six, do you have any pets

62
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:44,250
and what's unique about them?

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,720
- Ooh, good question.

64
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,910
I have a dog and a cat.

65
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,540
And what's unique about them
is they have Spanish names

66
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,860
because I love Spain.

67
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,350
Diego, the dog, and Alfonso, the cat.

68
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,690
- [Will] Seven, what's
your favourite thing

69
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,255
about the current season?

70
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,598
- Ooh, we're coming into spring,

71
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,390
and I love seeing all of
the bulbs that I've planted

72
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,193
in my garden start to peek
up and show their petals.

73
00:03:10,193 --> 00:03:13,830
- [Will] Eight, what's the
most recent book you've read

74
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,183
that you've enjoyed?

75
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:20,970
- "L'amica geniale," "My Brilliant Friend"

76
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,510
by Elena Ferrante, an Italian author.

77
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,560
I read it in English,

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,600
but my goal is to read it in Italian.

79
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,300
- [Will] Nine, what's your
favourite type of cuisine

80
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,800
to eat, and why?

81
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,060
- Ooh, that's hard.

82
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,340
I love so many different types of cuisine.

83
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,190
I love Lebanese food.

84
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,190
Anything that involves
fresh fruits and vegetables.

85
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,680
- [Will] 10, do you
prefer living in a city

86
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,140
or a rural area, and why?

87
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,090
- I absolutely prefer
to live in a rural area

88
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,143
because I find nature so relaxing,

89
00:03:53,143 --> 00:03:58,143
although I do miss the
conveniences of living in a city.

90
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,330
- [Will] Second topic,

91
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:03,360
work and career small talk questions.

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,676
Question 11, what do you do for work

93
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:08,096
and what's one thing you enjoy about it?

94
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:11,447
- I run an education company.

95
00:04:11,447 --> 00:04:13,920
So when I'm not on YouTube,

96
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,117
I'm making my English courses,

97
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:18,329
my online English courses.

98
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,040
And my favourite part of the
job is receiving feedback

99
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,693
from my students who
have taken the courses.

100
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,420
- [Will] 12, how did you get started

101
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,890
in your line of work?

102
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:33,397
- It all started with this
YouTube channel here in 2019,

103
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:38,250
and then slowly it grew into
something a little bit bigger.

104
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,490
- [Will] 13, what project
are you currently working on?

105
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,830
- We are currently
working on a huge project,

106
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,720
which is our C1 level course,
our advanced English course.

107
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,610
It's going to be amazing.

108
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,361
It's going to come out in May.

109
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,290
So if you're watching this in the future,

110
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,550
check the description box.

111
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,690
I will leave a link.

112
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,310
And if you are interested,

113
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,478
I have left the waiting list
so you'll be the first to know.

114
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:03,793
- [Will] 14, what do you think

115
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:05,759
the future of your industry looks like?

116
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,079
- I think it has a lot more

117
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,950
artificial intelligence involved.

118
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,700
- [Will] 15, what's one
thing you've learned recently

119
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,500
that's helped you in your job?

120
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,100
- I have learned to listen
carefully to criticism,

121
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,900
but to not take it all to heart.

122
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,504
- [Will] 16, what's the
best professional advice

123
00:05:24,504 --> 00:05:26,340
you've ever received?

124
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,230
- Well, it's not the most impressive,

125
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,810
amazing, mind-blowing
piece of advice ever,

126
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,870
but when my YouTube channel
was starting to take off,

127
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,180
I was starting to make
a little bit of income,

128
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,220
I asked my dad if I should do it

129
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,550
or if I should continue
with my planned career path.

130
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,627
And he said, "Give it a go."

131
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,217
"Do it for two years."

132
00:05:45,217 --> 00:05:47,527
"If it doesn't work, you'll only be 23."

133
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:50,340
"All you've lost is a little bit of time."

134
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,530
It ended up being the best piece of advice

135
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,940
I've ever followed.

136
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,100
- [Will] 17, what do you think sets

137
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,950
successful people apart in your field?

138
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:01,497
- I think they are
excited about what they do

139
00:06:01,497 --> 00:06:03,480
and what they create.

140
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,690
- [Will] 18, what's one
challenge you've faced at work

141
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,520
and how did you overcome it?

142
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,222
- One thing I found really difficult

143
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:12,474
is managing a team of people.

144
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:16,089
That's not ever something I
thought I was going to be doing.

145
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:18,030
And I've been trying to overcome it.

146
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,020
I'm still learning.

147
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,960
Recently, I have opened my calendar

148
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,090
so that at the beginning of every month,

149
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,560
everyone who works for me can
check in for a 20-minute chat.

150
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,570
We start this next week,

151
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,420
so I hope that we'll
help me be more in touch

152
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,866
with my employees.

153
00:06:34,866 --> 00:06:36,810
- [Will] 19, do you have any career goals

154
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,250
you're working towards?

155
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,740
- I would say more of a lifestyle goal.

156
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,890
I would like to not have
to work all the time

157
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,960
whilst my children are young.

158
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,270
I am not expecting children at the moment,

159
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,250
but I would like to
have them in the future.

160
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,720
- [Will] 20, have you ever had

161
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,094
an interesting work experience or job?

162
00:06:54,094 --> 00:06:58,740
- I worked in a juice
bar for a number of years

163
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,306
and I learned a lot about fruit.

164
00:07:00,306 --> 00:07:01,560
And I love fruits.

165
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,520
That was great for me.

166
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,240
- [Will] Third topic,
travel small talk questions.

167
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,027
Question 21, have you
travelled anywhere recently

168
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,860
and where did you go?

169
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,404
- Most recently, we visited Thailand,

170
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:18,404
and we went to Phuket and Koh
Yao Noi, and it was beautiful.

171
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,780
- [Will] 22, what's your favourite place

172
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,246
you've ever visited and why?

173
00:07:23,246 --> 00:07:25,560
- That would have to be Seville.

174
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,547
I totally fell in love with the city

175
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:31,140
and its culture and its people.

176
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,030
- [Will] 23, where would you like to go

177
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,260
on your next trip?

178
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,660
- We really would like to go to Vietnam.

179
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,280
I am desperate to try
pho, I think it's called.

180
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,640
The bone broth soup and with noodles, pho,

181
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,505
and I just really am
desperate to see that country.

182
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:51,810
- [Will] 24, do you
prefer relaxing vacations

183
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,150
or adventure trips and why?

184
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,550
- I like to have a good balance.

185
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,190
I do need to get the
relaxation out of my system.

186
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,810
I need to read a book,

187
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,850
I need to lie in the shade,

188
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,170
I need to swim,

189
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,010
but I go a bit stale if I
stay relaxing for too long.

190
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,990
I need to do things and see things.

191
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,240
- [Will] 25, what's one unique

192
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,690
or exotic food you've
tried while travelling?

193
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,420
- Most recently, mangosteen.

194
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,760
That fruit blew my mind.

195
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,310
It was so delicious.

196
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,110
I wish I could eat it everyday.

197
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,032
- [Will] 26, what's the craziest

198
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:30,720
or most memorable thing
you've done on vacation?

199
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,110
- I would say climbing
to the top of Lion's Head

200
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,450
in Cape Town at sunrise.

201
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,760
That was absolutely beautiful.

202
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,033
- [Will] 27, what's your
favourite way to travel?

203
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,928
- In style.

204
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:45,690
- [Will] 28, do you
prefer travelling alone

205
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:46,980
or with others?

206
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,470
- Always with my husband.

207
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,830
Well, my husband was a farmer
and now he works with me.

208
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:55,980
And before, I used to travel a lot alone

209
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,127
and I used to think,

210
00:08:57,127 --> 00:08:58,950
"Damn it, he would love to see this."

211
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,040
I always used to feel so sad
that he couldn't come with me.

212
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,370
So now it's such a pleasure
to travel together.

213
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,080
- [Will] 29, have you ever had

214
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,650
a negative travel experience
and how did you handle it?

215
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,447
- Yes, I once turned up at
a supposedly five star hotel

216
00:09:14,447 --> 00:09:18,622
that was nothing like the photos,

217
00:09:18,622 --> 00:09:21,348
and I very calmly explained

218
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:24,180
that I was going to move to another hotel

219
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,103
and I'd like a refund.

220
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,680
And luckily, they did comply.

221
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,050
- [Will] 30, what's
one cultural experience

222
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,410
you've had while travelling
that you'll never forget?

223
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,290
- La Feria de Abril in Sevilla,

224
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,780
the feria in Seville.

225
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,054
It's just this incredible party

226
00:09:43,054 --> 00:09:46,170
with striped marquees everywhere.

227
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,123
Everyone wears flamingo dresses.

228
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:50,250
(gasps) I can't wait to go back.

229
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,070
- [Will] Fourth topic,
hobbies and interests

230
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,870

Question 31, what's one hobby or interest

232
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,760
you are passionate about?

233
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,900
- Exercise.

234
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,240
It just makes me feel so good.

235
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,700
- [Will] 32, what's the most recent hobby

236
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,170
or interest you've taken up?

237
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,700
- I would say learning
Italian with my tutor Aliche,

238
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,690
who is amazing.

239
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,820
I found her on Languator,

240
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,310
which is a platform that I'm a part of.

241
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,110
You can find your own tutor

242
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,902
for the language you are learning.

243
00:10:20,902 --> 00:10:22,620

- [Will] 33, do you
have any hidden talents

245
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,270
that people might not know about?

246
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:31,050
- I can play the violin, and
I'm also really flexible.

247
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,713
- [Will] 34, what's one
thing you've learned recently

248
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:36,019

00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:40,320
(Lucy speaking in foreign language)

250
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,210
- I've learned to speak
Italian a little bit.

251
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,222
- [Will] 35, have you ever taken a class

252
00:10:44,222 --> 00:10:47,643
or workshop related to
your hobby or interest?

253
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:49,838
- Ooh, well, a workshop I took recently

254
00:10:49,838 --> 00:10:52,650
was a jewellery making workshop

255
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,500
where I learned to make a silver bangle,

256
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,880
and that was great fun.

257
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,716
- [Will] 36, what's the most adventurous

258
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:00,780
or daring thing you've done

259
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,680
related to your hobby or interest?

260
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,370
- Well, to do with language learning,

261
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,930
I think going to Spain
at the age of 16, 17

262
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,490
and spending a week there.

263
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,602
Immersing myself in the
language was quite daring.

264
00:11:15,602 --> 00:11:19,080
I spent ages saving up for
the language course myself

265
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,910
and it was fantastic

266
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,480
and the start of my language
teaching career basically.

267
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,630
- [Will] 37, what's one
thing you like to learn

268
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,660
or accomplish related to
your hobby or interest?

269
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,360
- Well, if we're going to
talk about language learning,

270
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,080
I always like to learn
how to make people laugh

271
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,580
in the language I'm learning.

272
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,280
That gives me a lot of satisfaction.

273
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,067
- [Will] 38, do you prefer indoor

274
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,401
or outdoor activities, and why?

275
00:11:45,401 --> 00:11:48,300
- Well, it's hard to say.

276
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,810
If the weather's good, outdoor 100%.

277
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,700
But I'm English, I live in England,

278
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,630
so I've just bought a
treadmill to run indoors.

279
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,720
- [Will] 39, what's one
activity or interest

280
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,760
you'd like to try in the future?

281
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,900
- What do I wanna do?

282
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,733
I don't know.

283
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:06,360
- Golf?
- No.

284
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,890
(Will laughing)

285
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:12,450
Oh, I don't know why, but I
really want to try archery.

286
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,283
- [Will] 40,

287
00:12:13,283 --> 00:12:15,720
what's the most interesting
thing you've learned

288
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,956
unrelated to work or school?

289
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:20,250
- How to run a business.

290
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,547
It is such an amazing experience,

291
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:27,390
and I learned absolutely
nothing about it at school.

292
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,860
- [Will] Fifth topic,

293
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,620
food and drink small talk questions.

294
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,670
Question 41, what's your
favourite type of food, and why?

295
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,113
- Fruit, because it's so refreshing,

296
00:12:38,113 --> 00:12:40,950
it tastes amazing, and
it makes me feel good.

297
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,410
- [Will] 42, do you enjoy cooking

298
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:46,230
and what's your favourite dish to prepare?

299
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,580
- I love cooking,

300
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,290
and my go-to dish is
actually normally a risotto.

301
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,399
I can whip up a good risotto

302
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,630
with very few ingredients in my fridge.

303
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,030
- [Will] 43, what's one unique

304
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,790
or exotic food you've tried and enjoyed?

305
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,480
- Well, in Thailand we actually
went on a cookery course

306
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,270
and we learned to make pad thai

307
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,900
and mango sticky rice
and green Thai curry,

308
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,700
and that was amazing.

309
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,970
- [Will] 44, do you have
any dietary restrictions

310
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,500
and how do you manage them?

311
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,430
- I don't.

312
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,790
I'm very, very lucky to have
no dietary restrictions,

313
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,010
so I don't need to manage them.

314
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,859
- [Will] 45, what's your
favourite restaurant or cafe

315
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,950
and what do you like about it?

316
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,560
- I love a good local pub.

317
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,750
We've got some great ones around us.

318
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,930
And for me, the best
part is on a sunny day,

319
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,750
an unexpectedly sunny day in England,

320
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:46,020
sitting outside in a pub garden.

321
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,828
- [Will] 46, what's one dish or cuisine

322
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,720
you've been wanting to
try but haven't yet?

323
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,010
- Vietnamese food.

324
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,900
I need to try pho.

325
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,750
- [Will] 47, what's your
favourite type of alcohol

326
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,550
or non-alcoholic beverage?

327
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,776
- I really like wine and gin for alcohol.

328
00:14:01,776 --> 00:14:06,120
Non-alcoholic, I love fresh fruit juice.

329
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,070
Fresh fruit and vegetable juice.

330
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,080
- [Will] 48, do you prefer sweet

331
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,753
or savoury foods, and why?

332
00:14:11,753 --> 00:14:13,680
- Definitely savoury.

333
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,410
Sometimes sweet foods can be overpowering.

334
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,660
And also, because we eat
them at the end of the meal,

335
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,340
I often don't have room.

336
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,340
I'm not very good at managing my appetite.

337
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,190
- [Will] 49, what's one
food or drink you've tried

338
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,690
that you didn't like?

339
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,470
- For me, it's anything that
is really, really spicy.

340
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,970
I can handle spice but not
obnoxious levels of spies.

341
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,670
Not the level that hurts your tongue.

342
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,136
- [Will] 50, have you ever
tried cooking a new dish,

343
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:43,080
and how did it turn out?

344
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,460
- I tried cooking pierogi,
I think they're called.

345
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,620
Potato dumplings that you often find

346
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,058
in Ukrainian and Polish cuisines.

347
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,828
And they went okay.

348
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,670
I found them delicious,

349
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,320
but when I showed my polish friend,

350
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,600
she said I'd done them wrong.

351
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,770
- [Will] Sixth topic,

352
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,950
family and relationships
small talk questions.

353
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,740
Question 51, do you have any siblings

354
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,590
and what's your
relationship with them like?

355
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,423
- I do.

356
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:13,050
I have a younger brother called George.

357
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,360
He's four and a half
years younger than me,

358
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,820
and we have a fantastic relationship.

359
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,230
I consider him a good friend.

360
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,972
- [Will] 52, what's your family like

361
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:23,728
and what do you enjoy most
about spending time with them?

362
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:25,380
- My family is small.

363
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,070
My mom, my dad, my
brother, my husband and me.

364
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:31,770
And what I love about
spending time with them

365
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:35,190
is that we just do not stop laughing.

366
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,130
- [Will] 53, do you have
any nieces or nephews

367
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:40,860
and what do you enjoy doing with them?

368
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,693
- Ah.

369
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,430
- [Will] Such a hard question.

370
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,180
- I have got a niece or nephew

371
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,330
that is due to be born in April,

372
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,534
so I'm hopefully gonna be an aunt.

373
00:15:53,534 --> 00:15:55,020
I'm so excited.

374
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,430
Haven't met them yet,

375
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,980
but if they are watching
this in the future,

376
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,840
I'm so excited to meet you.

377
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,347
- [Will] 54, are you in
a relationship or married

378
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:06,390
and how did you meet your partner?

379
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,880
- Yes, I am married to my husband, Will,

380
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
who is doing a very good job

381
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,450
of reading out these questions to me.

382
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,632
- [Will] Hi, everyone.

383
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:18,330
- And we met at Young Farmers' Clubs,

384
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,330
which is a very British
rural teenager social club,

385
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,656
which is just as cool as it sounds.

386
00:16:25,656 --> 00:16:27,660
But if you get a husband out of it,

387
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,294
it's totally worth going to.

388
00:16:29,294 --> 00:16:31,920
- [Will] 55, do you have any children

389
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,094
and what do you enjoy
most about being a parent?

390
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,147
- I don't have any children

391
00:16:36,147 --> 00:16:38,233
so I can't really answer that question,

392
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:42,570
but I hope to have them
at some point one day.

393
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,150
- [Will] 56, what's
one challenge you faced

394
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,240
in a past relationship and
how did you overcome it?

395
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,293
- Being unsuitable for
each other and leaving.

396
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,863
- [Will] 57, what's one
piece of relationship advice

397
00:16:56,863 --> 00:16:59,700
you'd give to someone
in a new relationship?

398
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,210
- Infatuation is very
different to long lasting love,

399
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,880
but you can enjoy both
stages with each other

400
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,079
in different ways.

401
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,539
- [Will] 58, have you
ever been on a memorable

402
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,240
or interesting date and what happened?

403
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,770
- Once I went on a date with a guy

404
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,691
and he asked me what I
wanted to drink and I said,

405
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:18,510
"Please, can I have a gin and tonic?"

406
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,270
And the barman said, "normal or slimline?"

407
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,020
And the guy looked me up and
down and said, "slimline."

408
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,463
And it wasn't a joke.

409
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,160
He was weird.

410
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,320
- [Will] 59, do you have a best friend

411
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,492
and what's one thing you love about them?

412
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:37,830
- I have two best friends and
I love them in different ways.

413
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,150
I've got my friend, Ellie.

414
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,430
I have loads of history with her.

415
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,490
We've known each other since
we were born basically.

416
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:49,230
And my friend Felicity is
someone I see sporadically.

417
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,340
But when we get together,

418
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,530
it's like no time has passed at all.

419
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,088
- [Will] 60, what's one
memorable family holiday

420
00:17:55,088 --> 00:17:57,180
or trip you've taken together?

421
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,590
- So growing up,

422
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,607
my grandparents had a little apartment

423
00:18:01,607 --> 00:18:03,870
in the south of Portugal.

424
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,930
They used to hibernate there
in the winter and play golf.

425
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,900
And we went there every
summer as a family.

426
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,870
And I hadn't been back
there for seven years,

427
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:17,870
and I went back last year with
my husband and my parents,

428
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,970
and it was amazing to be in
my childhood holiday location

429
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,930
and to have my husband.

430
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,800
I felt like a child and
an adult all at once.

431
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,960
It was a crazy, crazy experience.

432
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,770
- [Will] Seventh topic, current
events small talk questions.

433
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,230
Question 61, have you been following

434
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,133
any interesting news stories lately,

435
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,310
and what are your thoughts on them?

436
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,593
- One big news story in the UK recently

437
00:18:43,593 --> 00:18:47,760
was about a woman that went
missing called Nicola Bulley,

438
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,817
and I found that really, really scary

439
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,780
and fascinating to watch at the same time.

440
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,730
- [Will] 62, what's your opinion

441
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,970
on the current political
climate or social issues?

442
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:02,820
- Oh, well that's a big question.

443
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,320
Dire.

444
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,735
- [Will] 63, have you
tried any new technology

445
00:19:06,735 --> 00:19:09,876
or gadgets recently and
what's your review of them?

446
00:19:09,876 --> 00:19:13,005
- I have been playing around with ChatGPT,

447
00:19:13,005 --> 00:19:18,005
and it has been scary and
useful all at the same time.

448
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,380
- [Will] 64, what's one
recent scientific discovery

449
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,050
or breakthrough that
caught your attention?

450
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,710
- Definitely the development
of artificial intelligence.

451
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,260
I feel that we are at a turning point.

452
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,036
- [Will] 65, have you been
following any sports news,

453
00:19:34,036 --> 00:19:37,260
and what teams or athletes do you support?

454
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,093
- Not really.

455
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,070
I mean, the Six Nations is going on

456
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,071
and my husband talks a lot about it,

457
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:45,600
but I can't say that sport
really interests me too much.

458
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,271
- [Will] 66, what's your opinion

459
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,370
on the latest celebrity gossip or news?

460
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:53,640
- I used to follow a lot of
celebrity gossip and news.

461
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I just don't find it
as interesting anymore.

462
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,030
But I do really like
seeing beautiful dresses

463
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,230
on the red carpet.

464
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,940
- [Will] 67, what's your take

465
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,606
on the current state of
the economy or job market?

466
00:20:05,606 --> 00:20:08,610
- I'm really worried about
the economy at the moment.

467
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,410
We have huge inflation.

468
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,090
Food is really expensive.

469
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,680
Fuel is really expensive.

470
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,240
It costs a lot to heat your home.

471
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,270
In the job market, I've heard
rumours that people are taking

472
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,800
a little bit more control

473
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,203
and not accepting as low pay,

474
00:20:21,203 --> 00:20:23,340
and I'm really for that.

475
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,865
- [Will] 68, have you discovered
any interesting books,

476
00:20:25,865 --> 00:20:28,920
podcasts, or other media lately

477
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,720
and what did you like about them?

478
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,540
- There are two podcasts that
I've been enjoying recently,

479
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,595
and they are by two British newspapers

480
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:40,170
that are leaning to
the left and the right,

481
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:42,828
so I get both sides of
the same story really.

482
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:46,470
One is Stories of our
times by The Sunday Times.

483
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,050
The other is Today in
Focus by The Guardian.

484
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,540
And it's really interesting
to hear them both cover

485
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,510
the same story but in
slightly different ways.

486
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,660
- [Will] 69, what's your
opinion on climate change

487
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,080
and what actions do you think
we can take to combat it?

488
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,720
- I feel frustrated by climate change

489
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,990
because there are these huge corporations

490
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,516
making so much of a negative impact

491
00:21:09,516 --> 00:21:14,117
that sometimes as one human
I feel quite insignificant.

492
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:17,190
But I'm really, really making an effort

493
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,640
to take more control over what I can do

494
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,920
to improve climate change.

495
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,600
- [Will] 70, have you been following

496
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,710
any recent cultural trends or movements,

497
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:29,190
and what's your take on them?

498
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,097
- I have been interested in the Anti-Work

499
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:34,299
or Anti-Work Movement.

500
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:36,060
I like using Reddit,

501
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,379
and I've seen some things
on that Reddit sub-forum

502
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:41,010
and I find them really interesting

503
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,910
that people are suddenly
sticking it to the man.

504
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,540
- [Will] Eighth topic,
personal small talk questions.

505
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,680
Question 71, where did you
grow up, and what was it like?

506
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,910
- I grew up in a tiny
village in Bedfordshire,

507
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,261
and it was a very happy childhood.

508
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:01,486
Very rural, in the countryside,

509
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,660
lots of playing in the garden.

510
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,030
- [Will] 72, what's one childhood memory

511
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:08,250
that stands out to you, and why?

512
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,840
- I remember waking up,

513
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,830
it must have been my
seventh birthday I think,

514
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,830
and my parents had put a
trampoline in the garden.

515
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,970
And I kid you not,

516
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,120
I spent every waking
hour on that trampoline.

517
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,430
I absolutely loved it.

518
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,160
- [Will] 73, what was
your relationship like

519
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,710
with your sibling when
you were both growing up?

520
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,820
- Well, it was funny

521
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,310
because I was five
years older than George.

522
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,610
That's a big gap when
one is two and one is six

523
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,830
or when one is 10 and one is 14.

524
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,500
So we weren't so close as children.

525
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,350
It's only now we are adults
that we are really close.

526
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,270
- [Will] 74, what's the best thing

527
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,393
that's ever happened to you
and how did it make you feel?

528
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,550
- Getting married.

529
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:57,090
I just felt high on life.

530
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,340
I was so unbelievably happy.

531
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,920
I got to marry the man of my dreams

532
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,520
and be surrounded by everyone I loved.

533
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,890
And it was just after COVID,

534
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,996
so it was the first time
I'd seen so many people

535
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:11,730
in over two years.

536
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,800
- [Will] 75, what's one challenge

537
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,900
or obstacle you faced in your life

538
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,400
and how did you overcome it?

539
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,350
- I was really ill as a teenager.

540
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,599
From the age of 14 to 16,

541
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,500
I had glandular fever

542
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,756
and then a weird post-viral
chronic fatigue thing,

543
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,470
and it wiped me out,

544
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:32,340
and it was a rubbish time
and I was very depressed.

545
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,300
It's such a blur that I don't
even know how I overcame it.

546
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,910
I just know that I had a lot
of support from my family.

547
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,490
- [Will] 76, do you
have any personal goals

548
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,536
or aspirations that
you're working towards?

549
00:23:43,536 --> 00:23:47,220
- Oh, a big goal is to have a happy family

550
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,720
with a couple of children.

551
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,090
- [Will] 77, what's one
thing you're proud of

552
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,271
or accomplished recently outside of work?

553
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:56,850
- I've made some pretty big
charity donations this year

554
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,730
that I am personally
very proud of, I think.

555
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,453
- [Will] 78, who's one
person that's influenced

556
00:24:02,453 --> 00:24:06,153
or inspired you and how have
they impacted your life?

557
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,600
- My dad because he's so supportive,

558
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,218
so kind, so encouraging,

559
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:14,370
and that's how I hope to be.

560
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,500
- [Will] 79, what's one thing you've done

561
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,261
for someone else recently
and how did it make you feel?

562
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:22,117
- I helped someone very close with me

563
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:24,550
achieve something they've
wanted to do for a long time,

564
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,482
and it made me feel really good.

565
00:24:26,482 --> 00:24:28,110
And that's all I can say.

566
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,540
- [Will] 80, what's one
thing you've learned in life

567
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,660
that's helped you grow or
become a better person?

568
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,530
- Not everyone is going to
like you, and that is okay.

569
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,640
- [Will] Ninth topic,
technology small talk questions.

570
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,150
Question 81, what's one
technology or gadget

571
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,610
you can't live without, and why?

572
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,020
- Oh, it has to be my phone.

573
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,020
So much of what I do is done on my phone.

574
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,247
- [Will] 82, have you tried any new apps,

575
00:24:54,247 --> 00:24:56,250
software, or devices recently

576
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,620
and what's your review of them?

577
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,470
- I've started wearing an Apple Watch,

578
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,848
and I've found it really good,

579
00:25:02,848 --> 00:25:05,670
although the battery life is terrible.

580
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,370
- [Will] 83, do you prefer Apple

581
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,437
or Android products, and why?

582
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:11,799
- I prefer Apple products.

583
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:16,620
I think they are really
user-friendly, and unfortunately,

584
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,690
I love the way they all
connect with each other.

585
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,270
- [Will] 84, have you
ever built or customised

586
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,435
a computer or device
and how did it turn out?

587
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,460
- No, I've never done that.

588
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,272
I would be interested in learning though.

589
00:25:28,272 --> 00:25:31,555
- [Will] 85, what's one recent
technological advancement

590
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:34,950
or development that you find interesting?

591
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,707
- AI, definitely artificial intelligence.

592
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:40,650
I feel like we're on the
cusp of something amazing.

593
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,570
This is the worst it's ever going to be.

594
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,820
It's only going to get better,

595
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,060
and I feel you have to
keep up or get left behind.

596
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,629
- [Will] 86, have you
tried virtual reality

597
00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:54,249
or augmented reality, and
what's your experience like?

598
00:25:54,249 --> 00:25:57,840
- I have, very briefly at an event,

599
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,250
and I thought it was amazing.

600
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,660
I'd love to explore it more.

601
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,142
- [Will] 87, what's one useful
app or tool you use regularly

602
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,090
and how does it help you?

603
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,240
- I use an app to track
my menstrual cycle,

604
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,210
and it helps me understand

605
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,370
why I'm feeling rubbish some days.

606
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,202
- [Will] 88, do you think
technology has more positive

607
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:20,220
or negative effects on our lives, and why?

608
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,770
- I would say in the grand
scheme of things, positive.

609
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,406
There are lots of negative parts,

610
00:26:24,406 --> 00:26:28,530
but definitely for medical
advancements, positive.

611
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,998
- [Will] 89, what's
one technological issue

612
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:34,200
or challenge that you
wish could be solved?

613
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,252
- My internet connection, please.

614
00:26:36,252 --> 00:26:37,916
I can't believe it's 2023,

615
00:26:37,916 --> 00:26:39,859
and in rural parts of the UK,

616
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:44,190
you still can't get
solid, reliable internet.

617
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,841
- [Will] 90, do you have
any tips or recommendations

618
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:49,800
for staying safe and secure online?

619
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,350
- Don't trust anyone.

620
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,000
There are so many scammers.

621
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,270
If it sounds too good to
be true, it probably is.

622
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:01,080
- [Will] 10th topic, lifestyle
small talk questions.

623
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,710
Question 91, what's your
typical daily routine

624
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,777
and how do you make the most of your time?

625
00:27:06,777 --> 00:27:09,870
- We normally wake up at around 6:30.

626
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,050
I nearly always have
porridge for breakfast,

627
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,660
lunch between midday and one,

628
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,630
and dinner between six and eight.

629
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,920
That's a bit random.

630
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,050
And I make the most of my time

631
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,802
by trying to get as much done
in the morning as possible.

632
00:27:25,802 --> 00:27:29,640
- [Will] 92, do you prefer
to stay in or go out,

633
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,441
and what do you enjoy doing
during your free time?

634
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:34,175
- Oh, I like a balance of both.

635
00:27:34,175 --> 00:27:37,024
I end up getting really
stale if I stay in too much.

636
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:39,120
I love going out of the weekends

637
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,613
and staying in during the week.

638
00:27:40,613 --> 00:27:43,320
- [Will] 93, what's one activity or hobby

639
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,764
you find most relaxing
or stress relieving?

640
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,690
- I don't know if it's a
hobby, it's an activity,

641
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:53,690
but taking a bath, and
especially a bath with a view.

642
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:56,400
I have a bath near a window,

643
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,140
and sometimes there
are sheep in the field,

644
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,497
and it's just lovely.

645
00:27:59,497 --> 00:28:02,241
- [Will] 94, do you have
any daily rituals or habits

646
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:04,320
that you swear by?

647
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,270
- I have a coffee in bed every
morning, and I love that.

648
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:13,414
I love that little 20-minute
period of waking up,

649
00:28:13,414 --> 00:28:14,640
having a coffee.

650
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,600
I know lots of people say

651
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,490
you shouldn't have it
first thing in the morning,

652
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,713
but it works for me, and
it makes me feel good.

653
00:28:19,713 --> 00:28:23,910
- [Will] 95, what do you
typically have for lunch?

654
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,981
- I normally have soup in the winter

655
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:29,334
or a salad in the summer.

656
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,470
- [Will] 96, what's one way

657
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,350
you like to stay active or healthy,

658
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,060
and how has it benefited you?

659
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,040
- Well, we love walking our dog,

660
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,588
so we walk in for at
least an hour every day.

661
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:43,799
I also have a stationary
bike and a treadmill,

662
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,347
which is great for winter

663
00:28:45,347 --> 00:28:48,120
because I don't have to
go outside when it's cold.

664
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,030
- [Will] 97, do you have
any guilty pleasures

665
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,340
and what do you enjoy about them?

666
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,050
- I love a glass of wine.

667
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,650
I love a Lindor Truffle
every now and again.

668
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,184
- [Will] 98, what's one way
you like to spend a lazy day

669
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:03,806
or relax after a long week?

670
00:29:03,806 --> 00:29:07,620
- I love collapsing on
the sofa with my husband,

671
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,620
my dog, and my cat, and
watching a predictable movie.

672
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:16,704
- [Will] 99, what's one
activity or practise you do

673
00:29:16,704 --> 00:29:19,530
to de-stress or unwind?

674
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,129
- I like to listen to audiobooks,

675
00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:24,060
so I might put one on
whilst I'm in the bath.

676
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:27,060
- [Will] 100, what's one
thing that brings you joy

677
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,987
or fulfilment in life and why?

678
00:29:28,987 --> 00:29:31,585
- There is so many things.

679
00:29:31,585 --> 00:29:34,560
Teaching is one of them.

680
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,210
My husband is another.

681
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,410
My family.

682
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,920
Yeah, that's an impossible
question to end on.

683
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,290
Did you see how even when
it was a closed question,

684
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,982
we'd add something onto
the end to make it open?

685
00:29:45,982 --> 00:29:48,930
I couldn't just say yes or no.

686
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,940
If you really want to
improve your English,

687
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,000
download the e-book that
goes with this lesson.

688
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,610
The link is in the description box.

689
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,430
Don't forget to connect with
me on all of my social media.

690
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,010
I've got my Instagram, my Facebook,

691
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,617
and my website where I have
my free pronunciation tool

692
00:30:04,617 --> 00:30:06,570
where you can click on phonemes

693
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:08,700
and hear me pronounce those phonemes

694
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,680
and the words that contain those phonemes.

695
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,780
You can also check out all of my courses.

696
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,790
I've got lots of different challenges

697
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,820
and also my B1 course, my B2 course,

698
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,730
and my C1 course is coming
out very soon in May.

699
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:23,213
I will see you soon for
another lesson, mwah!
