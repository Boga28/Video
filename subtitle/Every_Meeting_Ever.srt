00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,708
Tripp the Dominator: Hey, I was on this date the other night, and we were at this

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:04,323
restaurant,

3
00:00:04,323 --> 00:00:05,758
Tyler the Leader: Alright guys. Are you guys ready to get started?

4
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:06,610
Tripp the Dominator: Hang on a second.

5
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,711
Tyler the Leader: Tripp, are you ready to get started, buddy?

6
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:10,490
Tripp the Dominator: Ok you guys. We're all here, we should start.

7
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,998
[Music Intro: 00:10 to 00:13]

8
00:00:13,998 --> 00:00:17,161
Tyler the Leader: Alright, thanks for coming guys. I just wanted to take a few minutes,

9
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:22,086
and talk about some ideas for the marketing strategy this year. So, if you got one, just

10
00:00:22,086 --> 00:00:23,718
throw it out there. I'd love to hear them.

11
00:00:23,718 --> 00:00:27,657
The Time Nazi: Yeah, how long is this meeting supposed to last? The schedule wasn't

12
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:28,846
exactly clear.

13
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:31,091
Tyler the Leader: We should be out of here in thirty.

14
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,357
The Time Nazi: Is that approximate? Or,

15
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:35,371
Get Here When You Can Guy: Hey guys. Sorry, I'm a couple of minutes late. I got

16
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:36,136
caught in traffic.

17
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,147
The Time Nazi: Seven minutes, actually. A couple is two.

18
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:40,025
Get Here When You Can Guy: Ok.

19
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,674
Tyler the Leader: So what we're doing is coming up with some ideas for our new

20
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:42,809
marketing strategy.

21
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:43,341
Get Here When You Can Guy: Sure.

22
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:43,917
Tyler the Leader: Anyone?

23
00:00:43,917 --> 00:00:45,875
Nancy the Negator: I think we should implement Pinterest.

24
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:47,106
Carol the Underachieving Scribe: Oh, that's a fun idea.

25
00:00:47,106 --> 00:00:49,122
Ol' Thin Skin: What about a publicity event in the park?

26
00:00:49,122 --> 00:00:51,916
Nancy the Negator: Interesting, but how are you going to plan around the weather?

27
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,231
What if it rains?

28
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:55,674
Ol' Thin Skin: So, well party in the rain.

29
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:58,460
Tyler the Leader: Ok, I just want to emphasize, there's no bad ideas here. We're just

30
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,277
brainstorming.

31
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:01,993
Nancy the Negator: Yeah, I'm just really thinking that it'll be a huge waste of money to

32
00:01:01,993 --> 00:01:03,101
try to plan around the weather.

33
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:06,042
Ol' Thin Skin: Yeah, ok, we get your concerns, Nancy. Thank you.

34
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:10,469
Tyler the Leader: Ok, does anyone else have an idea, Ephraim?

35
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:16,595
W. T. Ephraim: I've always wanted to see rain fall down all at once, in a big splash,

36
00:01:16,595 --> 00:01:23,969
instead of small drops over time. I mean, think how it could impact the irrigation system.

37
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:26,567
Tyler the Leader: Ok, Terry?

38
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:30,456
Terry the Rambler: Well, I have an idea from my previous job, that I had last year, let

39
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:36,361
me take that back a little bit. I have this wonderful idea, but it doesn't really make sense

40
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:41,949
unless I just take it back a second, and bring it forward, together. It was like three weeks

41
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:46,035
ago, that I remember, he said something that I couldn't understand,

42
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:48,412
Tripp the Dominator: Hold on a second, Terry. Hold on. Thanks for pointing. Here's

43
00:01:48,412 --> 00:01:51,433
what we need to do, ok? Lauren, you got this?

44
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,476
Lauren the Social Worker: [Ignoring the meeting while on multiple devices]

45
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:55,581
Tripp the Dominator: We do a video submission contest on YouTube.

46
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,732
Nancy the Negator: Oh, that's been done.

47
00:01:56,732 --> 00:01:59,617
Tripp the Dominator: It'll be on Facebook, it'll be on Pinterest, it'll be on Twitter.

48
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:01,535
Nancy the Negator: If we do something with technology, we lose the senior

49
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:02,302
demographic.

50
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:03,895
Tripp the Dominator: So, you guys want to see an example?

51
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:07,177
The Time Nazi: Shouldn't we be moving on to the next topic? I mean, it's already a

52
00:02:07,177 --> 00:02:07,821
quarter after.

53
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:10,288
W. T. Ephraim: Ha, a quarter after. That's funny.

54
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,946
Tripp the Dominator: Uh, who knows how to put this on the screen, up there, because I

55
00:02:13,946 --> 00:02:17,608
want you to see all the details? Do we have cable? Does this cable work?

56
00:02:17,608 --> 00:02:21,281
Tyler the Leader: I think that's power. In think this one.

57
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:22,547
Terry the Rambler: [Unknown]

58
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:23,418
Nancy the Negator: That cord's not going to be long enough.

59
00:02:23,418 --> 00:02:25,168
Tyler the Leader: Does that remote go to the TV?

60
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:27,682
Tripp the Dominator: Plenty of time guys, no rush.

61
00:02:27,682 --> 00:02:28,859
Nancy the Negator: [Unknown]

62
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:29,725
W. T. Ephraim: I got a green marker.

63
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:30,718
Tripp the Dominator: Call the IT guy.

64
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,015
Tyler the Leader: Wait, turn what off and back on? Hello?

65
00:02:33,015 --> 00:02:35,294
Ol' Thin Skin: Ok, I've got it working.

66
00:02:35,294 --> 00:02:41,632
Tripp the Dominator: Good Play. Ok, now imagine hundreds of those floating around

67
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:43,990
the web. Do you actually want to watch it one more time?

68
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:44,941
Terry the Rambler: No, please.

69
00:02:44,941 --> 00:02:47,286
Tyler the Leader: Tripp, I think you're onto something with this idea. I really like it.

70
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:47,943
Carol, did you get that down?

71
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:48,772
Carol the Underachieving Scribe: Yeah, I got it.

72
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:53,891
Tyler the Leader: Sorry, what is c, test, up, sub, yt, prz?

73
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,660
Carol the Underachieving Scribe: Well, I'm abbreviating, to make room for all these

74
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,390
great ideas. Contest, uploading it to YouTube, funniest, and you can get a prize.

75
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,469
Tyler the Leader: Wait, where are the other ideas?

76
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,843
Carol the Underachieving Scribe: [Point to her own head]

77
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:07,313
The Time Nazi: And, time.

78
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:12,706
Tyler the Leader: Hey, where are you all going? We still have one hundred percent of

79
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:13,988
the things to accomplish.

80
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:19,984
Tyler: One of the biggest hassles in all of life is, when you're in a meeting, and you're

81
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:23,450
trying to get what's on the computer screen, to be on the big screen. Well, it's doesn't

82
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,575
have to be a hassle, thanks to our friends at AIRTAME. these guys have,

83
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:27,591
Tripp: Hold on a second. I don't know what you're doing here, but I just want to tell

84
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:30,824
you, real quick, about something called AIRTAME. It's a device that allows you to

85
00:03:30,824 --> 00:03:35,382

86
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,675
life way easier. Go ahead.

87
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,228
Tyler: That's, that's what I was saying.

88
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:42,886
Tripp: Oh. Well, I probably did it better. Click here if you want to see more about
