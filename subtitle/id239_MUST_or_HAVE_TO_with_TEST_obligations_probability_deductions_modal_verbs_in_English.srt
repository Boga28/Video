1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:06,040
You must wear a mask. You have to wear a

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:19,760
mask. They must be at home. They have to be at 
home. Must or have to? In today's lesson I'm  

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,680
going to teach you about these two verbs. 
I'm going to divide this lesson into two  

4
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:38,240
parts. Part one, choice. Part two, probability. What? 
Choice and probability? What's that? Don't worry,  

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,280
I will explain everything step by step. At the 
end of this lesson I have a test for you with  

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,680
10 questions. Can you please let me know how you 
did on the test? Did you get 10 correct out of  

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:00,760
10? Or maybe, 6 correct out of 10? Let me know, 
I really love hearing from you. Well, my name's  

8
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:10,360
Arnel, let's start. First things first. The 
grammatical structures. You can see I have:  

9
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:21,520
Subject, must, have to plus base verb. What's the 
base verb? Well, the base form of the verb, is verb  

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:32,520
number one: Eat, ate, eaten. Play, played, played. 
Eat and play are the base form of the verb. You  

11
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:47,520
can see, must remains the same for all subjects. 
I must go, you must go, he must go. He musts go?  

12
00:01:47,520 --> 00:02:01,360
She must goes? The forms stay the same. You can see, 
have to, changes depending on the subject. I  

13
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:14,600
have to go, you have to go. But, he/she/it, has to 
go. And we always keep the base form after, to.  

14
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:26,120
She has to goes? Never. There's one more thing I 
want to add in this part. You might hear or see

15
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:38,560
this. I have got to go, you have got to go. This 
is perfectly correct, it's just a little less  

16
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,440
formal. In today's lesson I'm not going to go 
into, have got to, because I really just want  

17
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:53,920
to focus on must, and have to. I do have a lesson 
on this topic, I'll leave the video link in the  

18
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:03,040
description and comments down below for you. 
Part one, choices. You can see my line here.  

19
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:13,560
I have no choice and, your choice. What do I mean 
by that? Well, no choice means you cannot choose.  

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:22,840
We're talking about obligations like rules 
and laws. Your choice means you can choose. We  

21
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:30,160
can use must and have to when you do not have 
a choice. The verbs mean the exact same same

22
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:40,680
thing. Citizens must pay tax. Citizens 
are people who have a passport from  

23
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:52,960
that country. So for example, I can say she is an 
Indian citizen. He is a Mexican citizen. Citizens  

24
00:03:52,960 --> 00:04:02,920
have to pay tax. Notice the pronunciation, 
have to. Have to. There's 'f' sound, have

25
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:12,080
to. Yes, you can say, citizens have got to 
pay tax. But again, I'm not going to focus  

26
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:22,160
on that. Students must wear a school uniform. 
Students have to wear a school uniform. No

27
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:33,560
choice. If you want to hunt deer in the woods, 
you must have a hunting license. You have to  

28
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:43,920
have a hunting license. I know have to have seems 
strange, but there's have to plus the base form  

29
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,080
of the verb. Perfectly correct. Have to have. With 
all of my examples so far you can see there's no  

30
00:04:51,080 --> 00:05:02,080
choice. If you don't do these things there will 
be a punishment. You might need to pay a fine. A  

31
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:11,280
fine is money you need to pay, it's a penalty, or 
maybe you might go to jail. Those are punishments.  

32
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:21,280
Okay, so if we can use these verbs in the same way, 
are there no differences? Are they exactly the same?  

33
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:31,240
With rules and laws must is more common in formal 
written English, official contexts. Let's look at  

34
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:40,840
a sign. Employees ... wash hands before leaving the 
restroom. Must or have to? Which one do you think it

35
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:53,360
is? Right, must. Have to is perfectly correct. 
You could see, employees have to wash hands  

36
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,000
before leaving the restroom. But again, 
this is written, it's a sign. I want to  

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,080
show you a couple more examples of 
must being more common in written,  

38
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,320
formal contexts. Imagine you want to 
visit the White House in the USA. Let's

39
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:22,520
go here. I have the White House 
website, you can visit the white  

40
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:29,400
house if you want. I'm going to 
quickly scroll through this. Must,

41
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:42,440
must, must. All of the examples with must 
give you a rule. There's not a single have  

42
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:49,640
to on this page. If you want to read the full 
sentences, I'll leave this website link in  

43
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:57,800
the description below for you, but I think you 
get the idea. Here's a common question: Is this  

44
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:08,000
American English or British English? Both. Must and 
have to are common everywhere. Let's say you want  

45
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:20,760
to visit Big Ben in London. The Big Ben 
tour is not suitable for everyone. Visitors must  

46
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:30,520
be aged 11 and over. Visitors have to be aged 
11 and over, perfectly correct. But again, this  

47
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:39,520
is written. Okay, I'll bring up the grammatical 
structures once again. Remember earlier in this  

48
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:50,560
lesson I said: The forms stay the same. So if 
the forms are always the same, how do we know  

49
00:07:50,560 --> 00:08:00,280
if we're speaking about the past, the present, or 
the future? I think we need a chart. Okay, I have  

50
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:09,040
rules and laws here. We are still speaking about no 
choice. Past, present, and future. And must and have

51
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:21,400
to. You can see with must there is only one 
form. Citizens must pay tax. This is true now,  

52
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:28,120
right? Students have to wear a school 
uniform. This is also true now. When I  

53
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:35,760
was in school I had to wear a school uniform. 
Next year, students will have to wear a school

54
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,559
uniform. Here's a headline from National 
geographic.com. You've had to cancel your  

55
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:50,800
vacation. Here's what to do next. Here we see 
the present perfect tense being used. So you  

56
00:08:50,800 --> 00:09:00,720
can see, have to is much more diverse in terms 
of tense. There is no mustard. There is no will  

57
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,440
must. So, in your speaking or writing, if 
you want to change the tense you need to  

58
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:20,200
use, have to. You have to, use have to? Things 
change in the negative, take a look. You can  

59
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:30,920
see I must not go. You must not go. He/she/it 
must not go. The forms don't change. I do not  

60
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:40,120
have to go. You do not have to go. He/she/it, does not have to go. Remember that, does.  

61
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:49,840
The correct structure is: Subject, do not have 
to, plus base verb. We do not say, I haven't to

62
00:09:49,840 --> 00:10:05,600
go. Look, in the negative must not remain the same, 
no choice. Let's go to the zoo. Visitors must not  

63
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:14,880
touch the animals. I think that's clear. You must 
not do it, it's dangerous. Many zoos have a petting  

64
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:23,760
zoo. What's a petting zoo? A petting zoo is a mini 
zoo where you can go to pet the animals. Like in  

65
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:35,520
this picture, here. And the verb pet is this. So you 
can pet a cat, you can pet a dog. We have a petting  

66
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:42,600
zoo, you can pet the animals. Have you seen Jurassic 
world? In that movie there's a Dinosaur petting

67
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:57,800
zoo. Anyway, if you go to a petting zoo, would 
someone say this: You must pet the animals, you  

68
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,120
have to pet the animals. No, nobody would say that. 
It's not a rule or a law, nobody's going to take  

69
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:16,680
your hand and force you to pet the animals. Would 
someone say: You must not pet the animals? No, if you  

70
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:25,600
must not pet the animals, why have a petting zoo? 
It's your choice, right? You can pet the animals or  

71
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:37,040
not. We can say, you don't have to pet the animals. 
You can pet them if you want, or you can just look  

72
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:45,920
and take pictures, it's your choice. I want to give 
you another example. Let's compare two different  

73
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:55,560
parks. Ah, it's a sunny day. It's the perfect day 
to take your dog out. An park A, we can see a sign:  

74
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:06,000
Dogs must be on leash and under control at all 
times. This is a leash. Hmm, shouldn't this say, on A  

75
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:16,680
leash? Well, with signs articles: a and the, are often 
removed. We can see a dog walker here with her dog  

76
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:25,000
on a leash. She is following the rules, very good. 
In park B, your dog doesn't have to be on a leash,  

77
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:34,880
it's your choice. Here, we have some dogs playing 
together. Maybe this is a dog park, but this couple  

78
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:41,320
decided to keep their dog on a leash. You can 
see, don't or doesn't have to means your choice,  

79
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:49,840
whatever you want. Question: In which park will 
you need to pay a fine if your dog is not on a

80
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:58,840
leash? Right, Park A.

81
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,360
We've looked at rules and laws. But what if 
we're speaking about personal obligations?  

82
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:16,680
For example, I must stop worrying so 
much. I must fix the sink today, the

83
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:28,280
dripping is driving me crazy. You must remember to 
thank Julie for the flowers. With these examples  

84
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:36,200
here, you can see these obligations are coming 
from the speaker, this is perfectly correct.  

85
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:43,800
However, this is more common in British 
English. Americans would tend to use, have to.  

86
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:51,240
I have to stop worrying so much. I have to fix a sink 
today. You have to remember to thank Julie for the

87
00:13:51,240 --> 00:14:06,280
flowers. I have to. I have to. I have 
to what? What's the verb? This is really  

88
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,960
common especially in spoken English. 
If the verb is already clear you do  

89
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:17,720
not need to repeat it. In this specific 
episode he means I have to kill someone,  

90
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,320
but he doesn't need to say it. Everyone 
in that room they know what he's talking

91
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:33,880
about. We should invite Dan and Julie to 
our party. Do we have to? Or, less commonly,  

92
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:44,120
must we? It's clear speaker B means, do we have 
to invite them? Must we invite them? Okay, let's  

93
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:53,840
move on to part two. Part two, probability. 
What's probability. I'll explain that as  

94
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,240
we go through the lesson. Here, we have Nick. 
What what do you think Nick's favorite color

95
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:13,320
is? Hmm, blue t-shirt, blue walls... everything 
is blue. His favorite color must be blue.  

96
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,440
His favorite color has to be blue. 
His favorite color has got to be

97
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:32,360
blue. But do I know this? Am I 100% 
sure? No, I've never met Nick. I'm 95%

98
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:41,440
sure. This is what probability is when we 
look at the evidence around us. So we feel  

99
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,560
very strongly about something. It's like 
the very first example I gave you in this  

100
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:57,240
lesson, they must be at home. I don't know that, I 
didn't see them inside. But their lights are on,  

101
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,680
they must be at home, they have to be at home. 
In your grammar books you might see the term,  

102
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:10,920
deductions. This is the same thing. When you look 
at a situation, you look at the evidence and you  

103
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:18,760
come to a conclusion. But again, you're about 
95% sure, you don't know this is an absolute

104
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:30,560
fact. How old do you think Leanne is? I've never 
met Leanne, I've never seen her passport. I don't

105
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:41,960
know, she must be in her 20s. She has to be in 
her 20s. In, English when we say someone is in  

106
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:56,760
their 20s, in their 30s, in their 40s Etc... We mean 
between the ages 20-29, 30-39, 40-49. I can say, my  

107
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:06,440
parents are in their 60s. So Leanne must be, has 
to be in her 20s. I don't have any bread at  

108
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:13,240
home, do you think the gas station will have 
bread? They must have bread, they have to have  

109
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,480
bread, everyone buys bread. Honey, I bought this 
sweater for you to wear to my parents Christmas  

110
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:29,520
party. You must be joking, you have to be joking. 
We can take a picture like Christine and Frank did last

111
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:44,520
year. Just like part one, things change 
in the negative and past. Present, Leanne  

112
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,680
must be in her 20s, Leanne has to be 
in her 20s. I'm almost certain. But  

113
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:58,400
how can we express the opposite? How 
can I say something is impossible?

114
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:10,200
Leanne can't be in her 20s, Leanne 
cannot be in her 20s, Leanne mustn't  

115
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:18,400
be in her 20s? Leanne doesn't have 
to be in her 20s? You can see the  

116
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,880
change is pretty dramatic in the 
negative. Let's take this to the

117
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:33,960
past. When Leanne graduated from medical 
school she must have been in her 20s. She  

118
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:41,440
had to have been in her 20s. I know the 
structure is pretty long. Subject, must  

119
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:50,360
have plus past participle. Subject, had 
to have plus past participle. The past  

120
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:59,320
participle is verb, number three: Eat, ate eaten. 
Play, played, played. Eaten and played are my past

121
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:10,400
participles. How can we make this negative 
in the past, impossible in the past? Leanne  

122
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:19,040
started medical school when she was 27, 
she can't have graduated in her 20s. She  

123
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:27,600
couldn't have graduated in her 20s, impossible. 
Some of you might be wondering, but what about  

124
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:35,720
the future? Well, there isn't really a future 
form for this. We would use other structures.  

125
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,400
For example: She will probably graduate 
in her 20s. She's going to graduate in her  

126
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:50,720
20s. There isn't really a specific form 
for these, for the future. Let's do another

127
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:59,760
example. Imagine you have a history test 
and you see this question: What year did  

128
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:11,840
the Titanic sink? Sink is an irregular verb. 
Sink, sank, sunk. I didn't study for the test,  

129
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:19,560
but I feel pretty strongly about this. 
The answer must be 1912, the answer has  

130
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:29,240
to be 1912. I mean, 1880 is too early. 1950 
is too recent. It must be 1912. Let's make  

131
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:38,600
this impossible. The answer can't be 
1950, the answer cannot be 1950, that's

132
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:46,160
impossible. So we're using the present because 
we're talking about the test, now. But let's take  

133
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:57,680
this to the past, to the actual event. The 
Titanic must have sunk in 1912, the Titanic  

134
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:10,000
had to have sunk in 1912. Past impossibility, the 
Titanic can't have sunk in 1950, it couldn't have  

135
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,600
sunk in 1950. If it had sunk then we'd have 
better pictures of it, but we don't. Have you  

136
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,960
seen the movie Titanic? I love that movie. 
If you haven't seen it maybe you've heard  

137
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,240
of it. We're going to watch a little clip and of 
course I'm not going to explain the whole movie,  

138
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:40,480
that would take 3 hours. But in this movie some 
people are searching for a very special diamond.  

139
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,680
They don't know where it is but this character, 
he's pretty certain he knows where the diamond  

140
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:56,280
is. So the diamond had to have gone down with 
the ship. So the diamond had to have gone  

141
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:06,600
down with the ship. Based on the evidence he's 
95% certain. Notice how he contracts to and have.  

142
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:13,280
Had to have. Had to have gone down with the ship. 
So the diamond had to have gone down with the

143
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:23,120
ship. So the diamond had to have gone down with 
the ship. Let's do one more example before the

144
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:33,680
test. Is this your phone? No, it must 
belong to one of my students. It has  

145
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,760
to belong to one of my students. 
I mean, who else? It can't belong  

146
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,920
to one of my students. I have a 
very strict no phones in class

147
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:53,640
rule. Imagine the teacher puts the phone on 
her desk, has her lunch break, she comes back  

148
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:02,440
and the phone is gone. A student must have 
taken their phone. A student had to have  

149
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:12,600
taken their phone. Who else? A student can't 
have taken the phone. A student couldn't have  

150
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:21,720
taken the phone. My office was locked during 
my lunch break. Maybe it was another teacher.  

151
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:29,560
How are you feeling? Let's move on to the 
test. Test time, 10 questions in total. Can  

152
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,000
you please choose the best answer for 
each question? Pause the video to do

153
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:46,160
this. Okay, here are the answers. How did 
you do? Please let me know your score in  

154
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,960
the comments below, I love reading them. I love 
reading your comments, thank you so much. I'll  

155
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,840
explain the answers in case you're curious 
why you got something wrong. But to do this  

156
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:06,040
I need my notes, because I haven't memorized 
all of the the answers. Okay, are you ready?  

157
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:14,680
Number one: Must not is clear. it's illegal to 
text while driving. Number two: Has to. Because  

158
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:25,400
the subject is she, she has to. Number three: It's 
your choice, you can wear a costume or not. Number  

159
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:33,160
four: Last year, so the past is clear. And this 
wasn't our choice, we were forced to do this  

160
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:43,480
because we were sick. Number five: Again, this 
is a law. Number six: Well, if a restaurant is  

161
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:51,960
always really busy you are 95% sure they have 
good food. Number seven: We need has to, because a  

162
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,800
subject is he. And if someone does something 
5 days a week you can be pretty certain that  

163
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:06,920
that they enjoy it. Number eight: Can't, because 
we think that's impossible. Brothers with two  

164
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:17,680
different nationalities are not so common. Number 
nine: We need the past form because we see, saw. Is  

165
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,280
it possible to use option C grammatically? Yes, 
but it's a logical conclusion that the same  

166
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:31,160
product comes from the same store. Number 10: 
Something wasn't possible. I was in New York  

167
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:38,720
last week. I can't be in two places at the same 
time. Wow, thank you so much for watching this  

168
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:50,440
lesson I hope you learned something new, 
and I'll see you next time! Bye!!!
