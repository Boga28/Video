00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,562
(bright music)

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,700
- Hello everyone and welcome
back to English with Lucy.

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,990
Today we are going to be talking

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,780
about some common English mistakes

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,600
normally made in spoken English

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,230
but also sometimes in written English.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,270
Naturally, these tend to be made

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,440
by people who are learning English.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,350
But there are quite a few mistakes in here

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,640
that native speakers also make.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,690
So you're not alone.

12
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,480
This is a very difficult language.

13
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,700
In this video, I'm going to
take the incorrect sentences

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,690
and provide you with the correction

15
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,170
so you can really get them into your head.

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,680
There's also a free PDF that
goes with today's lesson.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,740
It's got everything that we're
going to talk about today,

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,610
plus a quiz at the end so you can practise

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,443
what you've learned

20
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:55,470
and make sure you don't
repeat those mistakes.

21
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,560
If you'd like to download that,

22
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,510
just click on the link
in the description box,

23
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,710
you enter your name

24
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,940
and your email address,

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,820
you sign up to my mailing list.

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,420
The PDF will arrive directly in your inbox

27
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,120
and then every week after that,

28
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,010
you will automatically
receive my lesson PDFs

29
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:13,630
along with all of my news
course updates and offers.

30
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,850
Before we get started, I
just have a quick message

31
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,750
from the sponsor of today's video,

32
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,080
it is Lingoda, Europe's number
one trusted language school

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,310
Have you heard about the
Lingoda Language Sprint?

34
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,480
It is an intensive language challenge

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,640
where you take either 15 or
30 language lessons a month

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,120
for three months.

37
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,640
As a huge motivational push,

38
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,770
you can get 100% cashback

39
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,320
if you attend all of your lessons,

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,680
or 50% cashback if you take
the lighter Sprint option.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,830
You can take the Sprint in
English, Business English,

42
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,080
French, German or Spanish

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,500
from beginner to advanced level.

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,720
Lingoda is amazing

45
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,650
because they have incredible
qualified teachers

46
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,250
and their group sizes are so small.

47
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,530
You can attend classes 24/7
from anywhere in the world.

48
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,889
Their classes are of such high quality

49
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:13,210
with lots of speaking
practise and interaction.

50
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,130
I recently asked a load of my followers,

51
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,230
who has done a language sprint,

52
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,990
can you tell me about your experience?

53
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,000
And so many came back to me

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,050
and so many of them had
received their refunds.

55
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,090
It was crazy.

56
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,470
Lots of them said that
it was a real challenge

57
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,640
but that cashback motivation
really pushed them to achieve.

58
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,820
They also spoke incredibly
highly of the teachers.

59
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
They got to meet lots
of different teachers,

60
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,800
participate in lots of groups

61
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,460
and learn really specific vocabulary

62
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,640
in all the different lessons

63
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,580
that you can choose from.

64
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,130

Best of luck and I can't
wait to hear your feedback

72
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,780
when you finish.

73
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,310
Right, let's get started
with the speaking mistakes.

74
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,310
Okay, the first mistake is
the misuse of less and fewer.

75
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,380
And this is a mistake that I myself make,

76
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,270
I here, will make it a lot.

77
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,730
I hear my mum make it.

78
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,020
I don't know if it's regional.

79
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,930
I think it's just a mistake

80
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,200
that native speakers
make a lot of the time.

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,460
If you manage to use
less and fewer correctly,

82
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,870
then you can confidently say

83
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,730
that you speak better

84
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,410
than a lot of native
speakers including me.

85
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:38,100
Let's take a look at this sentence.

86
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,350
It's incorrect, I warn you.

87
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,210
Don't write it down.

88
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,840
There are less people than yesterday,

89
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,810
there are less people than yesterday.

90
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,550
This should be corrected to

91
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,380
there are fewer people than yesterday.

92
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,290
Why is this?

93
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,550
Well, we use less with uncountable nouns

94
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,260
and fewer with countable nouns

95
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,830
and people, it's countable noun.

96
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,070
If you find it confusing,

97
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,710
you can think of it this way.

98
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,810
Less is used with singular
or uncountable nouns

99
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,720
and fewer is used with
plural or countable nouns.

100
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,150
Which one of these is correct?

101
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,040
The baby weighed fewer
than two pounds at birth,

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,970
or the baby weighed less
than two pounds at birth.

103
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,388
I'll give you a couple of
seconds, less or fewer?

104
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:26,870
(clock ticking)

105
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,200
It should be fewer.

106
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,950
Pounds, plural countable noun.

107
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,690
Right, let's move on to three and four,

108
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,700
our next two mistakes.

109
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,630
We're going to be looking at me and I.

110
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,760
Once again, this is a mistake
that I have made many times

111
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,600
in the past and every now and again,

112
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,000
I do make this mistake and
my dad always corrects me.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,610
The issue is that many native speakers

114
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,610
are taught to be wary of me,

115
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,130
not me in particular, the word me.

116
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,920
We're always told it
shouldn't be him and me.

117
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,030
It should be him and I.

118
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,780
But this isn't always correct.

119
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,770
It depends on the placement.

120
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,930
Have a look at this sentence.

121
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,030
They gave it to him and I,

122
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,120
they gave it to him and I,

123
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,830
this is incorrect, it should be,

124
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,480
they gave it to him and me.

125
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,260
Now there's quite a
simple trick for checking

126
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,530
if it should be him and I or him and me.

127
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:25,110
Remove the him and and see if it fits.

128
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,330
They gave it to I doesn't fit,

129
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,920
they gave it to me does fit,

130
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,519
we're going to be focusing
on subject verb agreement.

131
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:38,829
This is one of the first
things you learn in English.

132
00:05:38,829 --> 00:05:41,409
But it's hard, it can
get quite complicated

133
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,909
and we often make mistakes.

134
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,649
I often hear sentences like this,

135
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,599
one of you are gonna get hurt,

136
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:49,529
one of you are going to get hurt

137
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:53,149
and to my ear, it doesn't
actually sound too bad

138
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:56,619
but it is technically
grammatically incorrect.

139
00:05:56,619 --> 00:06:01,089
It should be one of you
is going to get hurt.

140
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,969
One of you is going to get hurt

141
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:06,479
because there is is
agreeing with one of you,

142
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,879
one of this group of you, one is.

143
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:12,349
Have a look at this next one,

144
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,099
which one do you think is correct?

145
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:20,099
Neither car are very fast,
neither car is very fast.

146
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,932
Are or is, I'll give
you a couple of seconds.

147
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:26,599
(clock ticking)

148
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:30,289
It should be is.

149
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:34,519
Neither means not this one, nor this one.

150
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,099
Neither is singular.

151
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,799
Last one, see if you can get it,

152
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,069
each of the plates are broken,

153
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:43,719
or each of the plates is broken.

154
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:44,960
Give you a couple of seconds.

155
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,229
(clock ticking)

156
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:49,059
It should be is again,

157
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:53,629
each one, each individual
singular is broken.

158
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:55,999
I personally find those quite tricky.

159
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,809
It might seem absolutely obvious to you

160
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:01,309
but to me, I really do
find that quite hard.

161
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:03,509
I find strange things quite hard,

162
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:04,342
like the difference

163
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:07,189
between take and bring and left and right.

164
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:08,589
Would you believe it?

165
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:10,319
It's funny how everyone's brains work.

166
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,869
Let's take a look at
the articles a and an.

167
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,979
This is a very common mistake that I hear,

168
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,289
normally made by learners of English.

169
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,469
I might hear them say something
like it's a old dress.

170
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:25,599
It's a old dress

171
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,259
where it should be, it's an old dress.

172
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:34,259
We use an because the word
that comes after the article

173
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,052
begins with a vowel sound, an old, an old,

174
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,139
it's actually hard to
say a old, a old, a old,

175
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,249
you need to do a little tiny glottal stop.

176
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,479
Another one, it's a amazing deal.

177
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,699
It's a amazing deal.

178
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:53,909
It should be.

179
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,829
It's an amazing deal.

180
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:57,322
It's an amazing deal.

181
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:59,389
I used to live with an Italian girl

182
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,879
who's a very good friend

183
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,819
and she often made the
mistake of actually doing this

184
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:04,799
the other way around.

185
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:09,666
Because with words that began
with an H sound /h/ like hat,

186
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:12,989
she wouldn't pronounce
that consonant sound,

187
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:15,899
she would start it with the
/a/ vowel sound instead,

188
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,189
she would say at instead of hat.

189
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:22,299
So she said I have bought an at.

190
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:24,009
I have bought an at.

191
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:27,259
And I thought that was a
very very interesting thing

192
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,039
because she was correctly
making the calculations

193
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,759
of whether she should say a or an,

194
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:34,068
it's just was that

195
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:36,498
she was pronouncing the
following word incorrectly.

196
00:08:36,499 --> 00:08:40,318
There are some dialects and
accents like the cockney accent

197
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:42,438
where they often drop the H's.

198
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:46,179
I wonder if they would say I bought an hat

199
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:48,682
instead of I bought a hat.

200
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,352
I'm not sure.

201
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:51,439
I have to ask someone

202
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,029
because that seems really interesting.

203
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:54,399
Next we're going to look at the difference

204
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,569
between beside and besides,

205
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,369
these are commonly confused words.

206
00:08:59,369 --> 00:09:01,509
Take a look at this sentence.

207
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:03,629
She sat besides the river.

208
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,529
She sat besides the river.

209
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:06,629
This is wrong.

210
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,699
It should be, she sat beside the river,

211
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:13,509
beside means next to,

212
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:16,329
besides means in addition to.

213
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:17,162
Can you tell me

214
00:09:17,162 --> 00:09:19,869
which of these next two
sentences is correct?

215
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:21,569
I could never be a dancer.

216
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:24,079
Beside, I'm too old now.

217
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,849
Or I could never be a dancer.

218
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,209
Besides, I'm too old now.

219
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:30,489
Which one do you think is right?

220
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,987
I'll give you a couple of seconds.

221
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:35,189
(clock ticking)

222
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:38,809
It is besides, in addition,
in addition to that,

223
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,379
I'm too old now.

224
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,339
Next, let's look at a very common mistake.

225
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:46,319
The mistake of repeating the subject.

226
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,219
I hear this all the time.

227
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:50,539
Take a look at this sentence.

228
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:52,879
My friend she's coming with me.

229
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,209
My friend she's coming with me.

230
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:58,329
It should be my friend is coming with me.

231
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,299
You don't need to repeat the subject.

232
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,719
It's either my friend is coming with me

233
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:06,169
or she is coming with me.

234
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:09,519
By saying my friend she's coming with me,

235
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,759
you are saying the same thing twice.

236
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,209
Another example, my
handwriting it's improving.

237
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,659
My handwriting it's improving.

238
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,839
This should be my handwriting's improving,

239
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,679
or my handwriting is improving.

240
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,709
No need to repeat yourself, we got you.

241
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,979
Next, let's take a look at
the incorrect use of nobody,

242
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:32,809
instead of anybody.

243
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:35,259
Now, I'm not going to say
that this is always incorrect

244
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,639
because it forms part of dialects.

245
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,539
It's quite cool slang as well.

246
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,739
But if you're looking
to write correct English

247
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:43,959
in an exam or something like that,

248
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:46,679
it's important to notice,
take a look at this sentence.

249
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,179
I don't need nobody's money.

250
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,149
I don't need nobody's money.

251
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,259
Now grammatically, this sentence is wrong.

252
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,249
Although it sounds right,

253
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,719
you'll hear in music all the time.

254
00:10:55,719 --> 00:10:57,579
It's like extra emphasis.

255
00:10:57,579 --> 00:10:59,859
But it's actually a double negative.

256
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,989
It should be, I don't
need anybody's money.

257
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:06,779
By saying nobody, you're
doubling up on that negative.

258
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,499
Another example, I didn't
meet nobody at the party.

259
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:12,539
I didn't meet nobody at the party.

260
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,369
Technically, it should be,

261
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:16,519
I didn't meet anybody at the party.

262
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:19,449
Moving on, let's have
a look at would have,

263
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,099
should have and could have.

264
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,379
I actually made a video
all about would have,

265
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,489
should have and could have.

266
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,499
I will link it down below
because it's very useful.

267
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,949
I know a lot of students struggle with it.

268
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:33,189
But there is a common mistake
used by native speakers again,

269
00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:35,679
because we have the reduction of have,

270
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,419
would have, should have, could have.

271
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:40,709
This has been misinterpreted
over the years

272
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,739
and people are saying would have,

273
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:44,749
should have and could have.

274
00:11:44,749 --> 00:11:46,689
But this is technically incorrect.

275
00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:50,499
And example is you could have
said, you could have said.

276
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,779
It's very hard to hear
that slight difference.

277
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,949
It should be could have said

278
00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:56,729
or she shouldn't have done that,

279
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:58,169
she shouldn't have done that.

280
00:11:58,169 --> 00:12:00,859
It's much clearer to
see in written English

281
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:03,689
or I would have helped you,

282
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:06,329
should be I would have helped you.

283
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:09,409
It's a very subtle
difference in spoken English,

284
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:11,719
but there's a very clear
difference in written English.

285
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:14,809
Finally, we have our last two mistakes.

286
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,829
This is one I read on a daily basis

287
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,889
in my comments section.

288
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,749
My lovely students asked me

289
00:12:21,749 --> 00:12:23,549
if I've visited their country

290
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,979
and they asked me, "Have
you ever been in India?

291
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,599
Have you ever been in London?

292
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:31,389
Have you ever been in Italy?"

293
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,009
For example, is the difference

294
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:35,319
between being in and being to.

295
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:38,169
To have been in means
it's a lasting action,

296
00:12:38,169 --> 00:12:39,359
which is still true.

297
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:43,259
I've been in here filming
for three hours, for example,

298
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,209
and I'm still here.

299
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,359
When you visit or travel to somewhere,

300
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:49,489
you can say that you've
been to that location.

301
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:52,259
We use it to talk about
our travelling experiences.

302
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:53,799
I've been in London before

303
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,449
should be I've been to London before

304
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,269
Have you been in India?

305
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:00,639
Have you been to India?

306
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,129
Right, that is it for today's lesson.

307
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:05,739
I hope you enjoyed it and I
hope you learned something.

308
00:13:05,739 --> 00:13:09,619
Now it is time for you to
complete the quiz on that PDF.

309
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:10,839

00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:44,589
and my website englishwithlucy.co.uk

325
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,699
where I've got an awesome
pronunciation tool

326
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:48,719
where you can click on phonemes

327
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,979
and hear how I pronounce those phonemes

328
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:53,818
and words containing those
phonemes, it's very fun,

329
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:57,086
/i/, word, no.

330
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,479
I've also got my personal channel

331
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:06,029
where I document and vlog my life here

332
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:07,499
in the English countryside

333
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,179
and all of the vlogs are fully subtitled

334
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,609
so that you can use them
for listening practise

335
00:14:12,609 --> 00:14:14,579
and to improve your vocabulary.

336
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,310
I will see you soon for another lesson.

337
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:17,952
(lips smacking)

338
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:20,535
(bright music)
