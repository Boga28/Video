1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,190
Two magical words to express
you’re grateful because someone has

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,968
given you something or done
something for you, thank you.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,650
Hello, hello guys, have you
ever wondered if there are

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,609
more alternatives to thank you?

5
00:00:18,089 --> 00:00:19,469
Well, there are.

6
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:22,759
Today we’ll be checking
some expressions to show

7
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,638
gratitude and different ways
to respond to the words thank you.

8
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:39,920
First thoughts on how
to show gratitude will

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,189
naturally be thank you,
thanks a lot, thanks a ton,

10
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:45,780
thank you very much.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,070
But you can also say
will you do that for me,

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,810
I really appreciate it.

13
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,500
I can’t believe you found them you rock.

14
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,369
Hey, guess what, I got in,
I couldn’t have done it without you.

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,420
Hey, this is for you, oh you shouldn’t have.

16
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,560
Hey Maria, I was printing my work
and I thought about you, here’s yours.

17
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,010
Hey, that’s so kind of you.

18
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:25,790
Oh my gosh, this painting looks great,
how can I show you how grateful I

19
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:31,290
am?

20
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,779
I bet the traditional way to
respond to thank you was one of

21
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,340
the first expressions
you learned in English,

22
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:41,659
but have you thought about
these alternatives before?

23
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,250
Okay guys, for this part of
the video I need your help,

24
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,240
the characters will
say the orange sentences,

25
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,349
which are the expressions to thank.

26
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,500
And you will be in charge
of reading the pink ones,

27
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,230
which are the expressions
to respond to thank you.

28
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:01,549
Will you do that for me?
I’d really appreciate it.

29
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,889
No problem. Will you do that for me?
I’d really appreciate that.

30
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:18,349
No worries. Hey guess what? I got in.

31
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,020
I couldn’t have done it without you.

32
00:02:26,539 --> 00:02:29,509
Oh, don’t mention it, congratulations.

33
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,219
Hey, that’s so kind of you.

34
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,719
Any time. Hey man, thank you.

35
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,400
Sure.

36
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,620
Guys, do you know any other expressions
to thank or respond to thank you?

37
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,778

38
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,180
