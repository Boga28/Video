1
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,060
The Rock: Thank you, Oprah, for having me.

2
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,060
Thank you, guys.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,060
Oprah: So, your father was very strict.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,060
Now, here's the thing.

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,550
You've gone one on one with some fierce competitors
in the ring, right?

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:32,390
But now you were in one of the scariest situations
any man can be in raising three daughters.

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:33,640
The Rock: Yes.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,890
Yes, extremely scary.

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,890
Oprah: And are you a strict Dad?

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:45,990
The Rock: I am.

11
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,590
Not super strict, but discipline is important.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,290
But also, you know, I'll go back to my dad.

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,350
My dad loved me with a small capacity in which
he was capable of.

14
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:02,300
So, I learned from that and so with my daughters,
I want to be as full and as present with the

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,560
love that I give them.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,670
Oprah: Present, yes.

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,970
That's what we were talking about.

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,210
What do you want to make sure that they get
that you didn't get?

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:17,280
And it's so interesting when you have children,
I've seen this from a lot of people who, you

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,770
didn't get what you needed.

21
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,330
You just didn't get what you needed because
of what The Rock just said, your parents didn't

22
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,170
have the capacity to give it to you.

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,219
And now that you're older, you have to learn
to give that to yourself and to be able to

24
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,249
give that to your children in a way that you
don't carry on what was done to you.

25
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:41,079
So, what is it you want your daughters to
know about the way you love them?

26
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:48,240
The Rock: I want my daughters to know that
I love them unconditionally, truly, unconditionally

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,920
without condition.

28
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,459
And I have a daughter who's 18 years old,
her name is Simone.

29
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:59,409
Jasmine who just turned four, baby, Tiana,
thank you who is getting ready to turn two.

30
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:05,490
And I am as I told my 18-year-old daughter,
Simone, I said I love you.

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,473
I'm going to tell you I love you every day,
I'm going to text you I love you…

32
00:02:08,473 --> 00:02:11,060
Oprah: So, you're one of those who say the
words out loud?

33
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,380
The Rock: Yes, because I didn't get that.

34
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:16,110
And I look at you, I love you and I'm going
to text you.

35
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,950
But I also told her, I'm unattached.

36
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,959
You don't even have to text me back.

37
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:20,959
Right?

38
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,959
You could text me back.

39
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:22,959
It's fine.

40
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:23,959
But you don't have to, like it's okay.

41
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:24,959
It's without condition.

42
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:25,959
It's unconditional love.

43
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,510
And I also want to teach my daughters the
value of hard work.

44
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,070
More importantly, I want to teach my daughters
the value of being kind, and how important

45
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,070
that is.

46
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,980
Oprah: Well, you know, I read that your father,
you used to watch him in training, and he

47
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,319
would say, “If I'm going to get up at 6:00
AM, you're going to get up at 6:00 AM.”

48
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:46,060
So, what do you think you've got the most
from him?

49
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,349
Was it your work ethic?

50
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:48,349
What was it?

51
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,040
The Rock: It was definitely my work ethic.

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,909
My dad was a man who, against the odds, made
it.

53
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:00,530
But he would get up at usually 5:00, 5:30
in the morning, and he would say if I get

54
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,110
up, you're going to get up too.

55
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,170
He would drag me to the gym and by the way,
I'm five years old, and he would drag me to

56
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,230
the gym.

57
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,230
Yes.

58
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,939
And I wouldn't work out, but he would just
make sure that I was there and be with him,

59
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,340
and that was our time that we could spend
together.

60
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,769
But I would say my work ethic from my dad,
my dad always said too that, regardless of

61
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,680
what you do in life and where you go, respect
is going to be given when it's earned.

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
And you have to go out and earn it every single
day.

63
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,870
Oprah: Yeah.

64
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,950
So, your dad taught you a lot.

65
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,250
I wonder, what have your daughters taught
you?

66
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:43,920
The Rock: My daughters taught me how to be
I think more caring and more sensitive and

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,060
more selfless.

68
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,500
Oprah: Yeah.

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,200
Were you there for all of them when they were
born?

70
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,550
The Rock: I was right there.

71
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,550
Oprah: Right there?

72
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,790
The Rock: I mean, right there.

73
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:52,790
Yes.

74
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,560
Oprah: I mean, you were right there.

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,939
The Rock: I was right there.

76
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:56,939
Yes.

77
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:57,939
And bring it on.

78
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:58,939
I mean, this is our moment.

79
00:03:58,939 --> 00:03:59,939
Yes.

80
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:00,939
Oprah: Yeah.

81
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:01,939
Yeah.

82
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,110
And is that a life-changing moment, when that
happens for you?

83
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,150
The Rock: It's the greatest thing that I have
ever experienced in my life.

84
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:19,608
And it gave me such a profound respect for
my babies’ mamas.

85
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:21,858
I have two.

86
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,860
I was once married and now I'm happily married.

87
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
Lauren is back there.

88
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,540
We've known each other for 13 years now but
I have, it has been the most profound experience

89
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,540
of my life because also too, you know, when
you meet...

90
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:38,500
As a man, you meet someone, you meet a woman,
and this is going to be the one and you want

91
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,570
to get married and my first marriage didn't
work out.

92
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:50,310
But then the birth of a child and what that
does and the lens perspective that just shifts

93
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,780
and it just gives me a new profound respect
for again, their moms as...

94
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,940
Oprah: So, it didn't work out with the marriage,
but then she became your business partner,

95
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,940
your first marriage?

96
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:01,940
The Rock: She did.

97
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Yes, yes.

98
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
Oprah: And you still are.

99
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
The Rock: We still are.

100
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,410
So, my ex-wife, Dany, we, the marriage didn't
work out.

101
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,590
And it was just one of those things where
it wasn't an ugly divorce, it was just marriage

102
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,790
wasn't in our cards.

103
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,030
We’re great friends.

104
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:22,250
Marriage wasn't in our cards, but we both
had an appetite for business and to accomplish

105
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,250
things.

106
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,570
And we thought, “Well, what if we continued
to do business together and do you think we

107
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,570
can?”

108
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,790
And it felt like we could make something happen
and we did.

109
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,690
Oprah: I know you didn't grow up with a lot
of money.

110
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,190
And I read the story about when, I think you
were 15, and there was an eviction notice

111
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,390
on the door and how that made a big impression
on you, right?

112
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,390
The Rock: It did.

113
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,390
Yes.

114
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,590
Oprah: Now, you’re one of the highest-paid
actors in the world.

115
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,400
The Rock: Thank you.

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I do all right.

117
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Thank you.

118
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,620
Oprah: You do all right.

119
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:04,000
And does that title, the sexiest man alive,
the highest paid in the...

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,990
What do those titles mean if anything?

121
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,380
You're the greatest, you're the most popular,
you're the most followed, you're the most,

122
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,700
you’re the most, the most, the most, the
most.

123
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,720
The Rock: It's great for the ego.

124
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,830
It's wonderful.

125
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,470
Oprah: Yeah, the better question is, how do
you keep your ego in check when all of that

126
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,470
is happening around?

127
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,470
The Rock: Sure.

128
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,290
Very important.

129
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,430
People I have around me and how important
that is...

130
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,990
Oprah: Do you have anybody who can tell you
the truth at this point?

131
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,000
The Rock: Yeah, she's called my wife.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oprah: Okay.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Lauren can tell you the truth?

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The Rock: Yes, Lauren can tell me the truth.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,500
But by the way, and this is where it's the
tricky thing for us to being in this position,

137
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,940
is we want to make sure that we have people
around us who are inspired to do well and

138
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:49,710
reach for and continue to share our vision,
but also at time say, well, I'm not quite

139
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,900
sure if that's the right thing to do.

140
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,870
So, look, I've had a wonderful career, especially
coming from being evicted.

141
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,020
And those titles are nice, and everything
is fine.

142
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:06,360
But honestly, I'm so grateful to be in the
position I’m in and I never take anything

143
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
for granted.

144
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I try not to…

145
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,030
Oprah: Aren’t you glad that you were once
evicted, because it gives you such an appreciation

146
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,030
for what you have now?

147
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,780
The Rock: It just gives such perspective.

148
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,560
When we were 14 years old, we lived in Hawaii
and we lived in a small efficiency apartment.

149
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,550
And we were, my mom and I came home, and I'll
never forget the rent was $180 a week.

150
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,550
And there was an eviction…

151
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,550
Oprah: A week?

152
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,550
The Rock: A week.

153
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,820
And that was an eviction notice on the door.

154
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:38,150
And it was, this was the one, it was the final
eviction notice, like, that's the one.

155
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,640
My mom started crying, and I never forgot
in that moment, it was a seminal moment for

156
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,800
me because I felt like I never want to be
in this position again.

157
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,130
What can I do?

158
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:55,610
So, at 14 years old, I thought, well, the
heroes in my life, Muhammad Ali, for example,

159
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,800
professional wrestlers, they're all men who
have worked hard with their hands and they

160
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,890
built their body.

161
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,230
Yes, that's what I'm gonna do.

162
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,500
I'm gonna do what my dad taught me and these
other heroes, I'm gonna go build my body so,

163
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,010
we're never evicted again, but being evicted,
by the way, has as you were saying has not

164
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:18,420
only given me just great perspective, but
also great gratitude, but also my team and

165
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:24,220
my family, we laugh at it, but I feel this
way like, “Oh, well, you know, we're a month

166
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,220
away from being evicted.

167
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,220
I gotta go to work.”

168
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,220
Like, I still have that in my head.

169
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,220
Oprah: You still have that?

170
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,210
The Rock: I still have that in my head, you
know, but it keeps you grounded by the way.

171
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:38,458
Yeah, because that's why the most this and
the most that again, it's wonderful.

172
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:41,199
But the alternative is what I once was.

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,620
Oprah: And it also doesn't change the way
you're wired because I still save toast.

174
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,770
I do.

175
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,010
I will save a toast rather than throw it away.

176
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:55,560
And I know there's going to be more toast,
but I still do because there's something in

177
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,310
me because when we were growing up, we had
to save it.

178
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,820
You know, you weren't allowed to like throw
food away.

179
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,640
So, that was a really big deal.

180
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,170
So, here's the deal.

181
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:11,000
You have now the... you get the biggest paychecks,
you have all this money, acclaim, fame, you

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,830
didn't have that growing up.

183
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:20,330
How do you raise children who have good sense,
and are also kind when they have everything?

184
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,810
Because part of what made you who you are,
is having had that eviction notice and having

185
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,200
not had everything.

186
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,580
So, how do you do that, how are you planning
to do that with your children?

187
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,141
The Rock: So, for example, with our 18-year-old
daughter, it was really important that we

188
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:38,110
share those stories, share the stories about
being evicted.

189
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,960
Her mom's parents were immigrants who came
over from Cuba.

190
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,490
It's important that we've always shared those
stories and also, we live, we try and keep

191
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,260
it as simple as we possibly can.

192
00:09:53,260 --> 00:10:01,130
I live, we have a farm in Virginia, happily
to say that I've moved my family here to Atlanta,

193
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,130
so…

194
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,570
Oprah: Yaay!

195
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:10,980
The Rock: Place 30, 45 minutes away where
it's very quiet, but also just making sure

196
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,740
that we continue to instill in the babies
and the kids the value of $1 and what it means

197
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,310
and the value of food and always saying how
grateful we are and the things that we're

198
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,350
grateful for, especially at that young age.

199
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,620
Oprah: So, I want to know, how is success
different from the way you imagined it would

200
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,730
be?

201
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,760
The Rock: I never imagined this.

202
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:40,490
I, at one time when I was a kid, I did feel
in my heart and in my gut, that I was... that

203
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,990
I thought, I think the world's going to hear
from me.

204
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,620
I don't know how, but I do feel that way.

205
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,880
But I never thought in my mind, it was this
level of success or fame even.

206
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,920
It was, I don't know how but the world is
going to hear from me.

207
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,990
So, you know, which is maybe why you know,
at times, I could walk around and I could

208
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,590
look at things like I'm a big kid, like everything
can at times can be like I'm in Willy Wonka's

209
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,290
Chocolate Factory, where I'm just really in
awe of everything that's really happening

210
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,290
around me.

211
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:13,550
Oprah: What's the first thing you splurged
on when you realize you had enough to splurge?

212
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,120
The Rock: Okay.

213
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,680
So, all right.

214
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,420
The first thing I splurged on, so when I was
a kid, 14 years old, 13, 14 years old, in

215
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:32,760
my mind, what it meant to be successful, it
was a Rolex watch, right.

216
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,820
So, there was such a valuable lesson out of
this.

217
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,790
So, I thought for years oh, wait, everyone,
every successful man has a Rolex watch and

218
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,220
has diamonds in it.

219
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,800
So, when I finally was making a little bit
of money, and this was in 1999, and I thought,

220
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,990
okay, and by the way, I was still living in
an apartment paying monthly rent but again.

221
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,760
Oprah: Oh, you renting and buying a Rolex?

222
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,130
The Rock: I was just renting, horrible financial…

223
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,720
Oprah: You should definitely if you're buying
a Rolex, okay.

224
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
The Rock: Yes.

225
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,980
This is what not to do.

226
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,550
So, I thought, this is it.

227
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:12,040
I'm gonna splurge and I went, and I got myself
a Rolex.

228
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,839
And I wore it at that time I was wrestling.

229
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,420
I was in the ring, not for a match, but I
was doing an interview in the ring.

230
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,930
And I wore it in the ring and a melee broke
out, which always happens in the wild world

231
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,850
of professional wrestling.

232
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:33,360
One of the wrestlers fell on the Rolex when
it came off, it broke, live TV and you see

233
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,120
me, “Oh my gosh, my Rolex.”

234
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,620
And I'm supposed to be in the moment and wrestling
these other guys.

235
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,850
“Oh, no.

236
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:42,850
My Rolex.”

237
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,550
Like, you can see the tape I'm trying to get
my Rolex and somebody's like kicking me in

238
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:48,640
the ribs while I’m trying to get it.

239
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,290
So, I finally got my Rolex back.

240
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,240
I go backstage, I look at it, I'm heartbroken
now.

241
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,490
This is my thing.

242
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:01,610
And I go home that night and I remember immediately
thinking this is a sign.

243
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,610
And I…

244
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,520
Oprah: Oh, I believe in signs, you know.

245
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,270
The Rock: Yes, it's a sign and I don't need
it.

246
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,970
And it wasn't right for me at that time, and
I never got anything like that again.

247
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:17,580
Oprah: And so now do you just, do splurge
carefully?

248
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,940
The Rock: I do.

249
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,730
I'm not a big bling guy or anything like that.

250
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,970
And I always want to just make sure that now
the splurge is usually with property.

251
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,472
Like we have two properties that way, because...

252
00:13:29,472 --> 00:13:30,760
Oprah: I believe in real estate.

253
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,339
The Rock: Yes, Yes, you do.

254
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,339
Yes.

255
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,339
Oprah: I do, I Yes.

256
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:37,360
I love property the way some women love shoes,
you know?

257
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I do.

258
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
I do.

259
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,680
Because God isn't making any more land.

260
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Okay.

261
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,680
The Rock: That's right.

262
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Oprah: This is what we got here on the planet
Earth.

263
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,680
You're not getting any more.

264
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,779
The Rock: Yeah, that's right.

265
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,340
And also, the properties are our anchor.

266
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,170
It's where we could be comfortable.

267
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,149
And so that and I have a few pickup trucks.

268
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:54,149
That’s it.

269
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:55,149
Oprah: Just a few.

270
00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:01,130
So, I remember reading this, that it was like
WrestleMania 13 and you're still being called

271
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:03,290
Rocky.

272
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:10,270
And there were a bunch of fans at the time
who were jeering you and they were saying

273
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,880
unkind things.

274
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,110
And you used that moment and literally turned
on your heels and turned it around.

275
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:22,120
And you know, this whole vision tour is about
people who've been knocked down sometimes

276
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,300
in life, everybody, you know, not in a ring,
but have had those moments where you didn't

277
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:32,730
feel like the rest of the world saw you for
who you needed to be.

278
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,400
How were you able to turn that around?

279
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,400
The Rock: Okay.

280
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,680
So, thank you for bringing that up.

281
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:45,200
So, this is, it was a turning point in my
career, and it really allowed me to grow.

282
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:50,460
And it really allowed me just to be me and
be anchored in with who I am.

283
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:55,800
So, when I first started wrestling, the idea
was, well, why don't you call yourself Rocky

284
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,990
Maivia out of respect for your dad, Rocky
Johnson, and your grandfather, Peter Maivia.

285
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,230
I hated the name.

286
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,980
And I thought well, I just wanted to make
my own way.

287
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,110
And I wanted to be independent.

288
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,420
I love my family, but I don't want to do it
like that because it feels like I'm trying

289
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,750
to leverage their fame.

290
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:19,800
The powers that be said, “No, that's your
name.”

291
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:27,020
I was also told, well, when you go out and
you wrestle, you have to smile.

292
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,990
I want you to smile big.

293
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:29,990
This is in the WWE.

294
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,910
Oprah: Why are you smiling if you…

295
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:38,720
The Rock: Because the idea was, I was a rookie
in the wrestling business.

296
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,410
I was a, what's called the wrestling business
as a term called babyface, which is a good

297
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,410
guy.

298
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,230
I was being groomed as a good guy, wrestler,
young.

299
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,020
The idea was you're grateful, grateful for
the opportunity so when you go out there,

300
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,060
I want you to smile.

301
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,490
You can't smile enough.

302
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,270
And I thought, “Well, what if I lose?

303
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,270
Nope.

304
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,050
Yes, exactly.

305
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,190
You still gotta smile and it just didn't feel
right.

306
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,830
That didn't sit right with me.

307
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:11,440
So, a few months later, the company made me
the Intercontinental Champion.

308
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,620
And then a month later we go into the annual
biggest event.

309
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:22,580
It's like the SuperBowl of wrestling, WrestleMania
and it was WrestleMania 13.

310
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:31,290
By the time I got to Chicago WrestleMania,
16,000 people in the middle of the ring when

311
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,970
I was in the ring and I'm supposed to be a
good guy and they're supposed to cheer me;

312
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,520
16,000 people were chanting, “Rocky sucks”.

313
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,620
Thank you for laughing, the few of you.

314
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,770
But it was...

315
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,740
Oprah: Can you hear the word sucks clearly
when you're on the mat Rocky sucks?

316
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,740
The Rock: Yes.

317
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,740
Oprah: Yeah, Rocky sucks.

318
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,610
The Rock: There's a reverb that happens in
the arena.

319
00:16:53,610 --> 00:17:02,899
And when in unison, not one person, “You
suck.”

320
00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:04,380
16,000.

321
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,760
And I was, I remember laying there in the
ring and the referee said to me, “Don't

322
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,770
look to them” And it was crippling for me.

323
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:21,449
So, then, at that time, the powers that be
thought, this isn't going to work.

324
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:27,449
And for whatever reason, people are not liking
you, and they're not connecting with you.

325
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:36,090
And so, in that moment, it was very defining
because I asked them if I could just be myself

326
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:42,899
and if I could go out there, and if I can
speak to the crowd, and if I could just be

327
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:45,210
myself and be authentic.

328
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,259
And if I don't want to smile, I don't smile.

329
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,769
If I want to laugh, I laugh.

330
00:17:48,769 --> 00:17:52,909
If I want to sing, I sing whatever it is,
I just want to be me.

331
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:58,749
Can I have that for one minute of live TV
time?

332
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:03,149
The powers that be at that time, Vince McMahon
said, “You got it.”

333
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:11,369
So, on Raw live TV, I grabbed a microphone
and I said, “I may be a lot of things but

334
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:15,830
sucks isn't one of them.”

335
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,340
And I said something to the effect of basically
it's not a this thing, it’s not a that thing,

336
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,929
it's a me being myself thing.

337
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:28,309
And before you know it, I guess the moral
of the story is the importance and the power

338
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:31,480
of finding your identity and being true to
who you are.

339
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,020
Even in that wild world of pro wrestling,
it still applies to everyone in the room,

340
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:41,679
and how powerful that could be because there
was a true shift and click moment.

341
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,970
And I never looked back and I became, fortunately,
the biggest draw that the business has ever

342
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,970
seen.

343
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:47,970
Oprah: Wow.

344
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,649
You know, I was talking earlier about intention,
and you have acquired and continue to acquire

345
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:58,030
a lot as you're continuing to build Seven
Bucks.

346
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,259
What is the purest, highest, truest intention
behind it all?

347
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:08,679
Because I know, at the end of the day, it
isn't all about fame and it isn't all about

348
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:09,679
making money.

349
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,650
So, the reason why you want to continue to
grow and succeed is what?

350
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,400
The Rock: To create an amazing experience
for people.

351
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,169
And that's important to me because that's
an opportunity that I have to give joy and

352
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:31,220
help, whether it transforms or a movie or
a thing or whatever it is like the audience's

353
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,499
experience, audience experience is something
that's deeply personal to me.

354
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:40,840
And I think that goes back to when I would,
so before the bright lights of the WWE, I

355
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,580
was wrestling in a small wrestling company.

356
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,690
I would wrestle in flea markets and use car
dealerships.

357
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,801
You put a ring in the used car dealership
in the parking lot, but the reason why I bring

358
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:55,789
that up and state fairs, but there was an
intimacy there and even at that level, it

359
00:19:55,789 --> 00:20:01,380
was always about well, how can I send the
audience home happy and make people feel good?

360
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,980
And by the way, I also feel like if you're
in a position to make people feel good, that

361
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,049
is such a powerful thing.

362
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:08,049
It's such a powerful.

363
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,049
Oprah: Yeah.

364
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,970
I know we did you for a masterclass for OWN
and something you said really stuck with me,

365
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,789
that the most powerful thing you can ever
do is to be yourself.

366
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:18,090
The Rock: Be yourself.

367
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,090
Yes.

368
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:22,950
Oprah: And you were talking about that earlier,
about that moment that you learned to be authentic

369
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,019
is when everything changed.

370
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:25,429
The Rock: That's when everything changed.

371
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:30,399
It's like a shift and click moment when we,
for me when I realize there's great power

372
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:33,710
and being myself, same thing for all of us.

373
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,710
But I do.

374
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,409
I believe it's the most powerful thing that
we could be.

375
00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:40,889
It's easier said than done because I struggled
for a long time trying to figure out well,

376
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:41,889
what's my identity?

377
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:42,889
And who am I?

378
00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:45,779
And, for example, when I got to Hollywood,
the very first time I got to Hollywood in

379
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:53,169
the early 2000s, I was told, again, well,
if you want to be a star, then maybe you shouldn't

380
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,690
talk about wrestling, maybe you shouldn't
go to the gym as much, maybe you shouldn't

381
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,359
raise your silly eyebrow.

382
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,730
And you know, there was a lot of things like
that, and when you don't know you buy into

383
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:03,730
it.

384
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,389
And so, I thought, okay, well maybe...

385
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,159
So, don't call yourself The Rock.

386
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:08,159
Okay.

387
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,559
So, again, I went through that in process
for years trying to figure out who I was.

388
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:18,320
And then when you look back at my earlier
career, the films I was doing, they were good,

389
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,669
but just not, you know, like “Oh, that's
how I like to see him because he is his true

390
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:24,669
authentic self.”

391
00:21:24,669 --> 00:21:29,919
Oprah: And have you had a sweet revenge moment?

392
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:37,399
The Rock: Yeah, who sucks now, huh?

393
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:38,779
Yeah.

394
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:44,279
Oprah: One of those.

395
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,320
The Rock: One of those.

396
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,759
Yes, it was...

397
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:48,759
Okay.

398
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:53,980
So, at this time when I felt like okay, I
really need to make a change in my career,

399
00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:01,049
I need to be me, and I want to have the kind
of career that is a global career.

400
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:03,519
And I said, I am not quite sure how we're
going to do it.

401
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,670
But I need you to buy into the vision with
me and I'm willing to put in the work with

402
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:13,960
my own two hands as I was telling my agency
at that time in Hollywood.

403
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,010
And they all looked at me like I had three
heads and they thought, well, we just don't...

404
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,210
They've thought, okay, sure, sure, sure, sure,
kind of placating me.

405
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,659
And then eventually I'd left them and then
decided, you know what?

406
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,269
My name is The Rock and I come from the world
of professional wrestling.

407
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:31,559
And I look the way I look.

408
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,110
And I talk the way I talk, and I love to work
out.

409
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,610
And you know what, this is who I'm going to
be.

410
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:38,889
And then here I am today.

411
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:43,480
So, for those who said, we don't get it, kind
of sweet revenge.

412
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,100
Oprah: So, you posted on Instagram in November,
“Joy and hope cost nothing” remember this?

413
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,159
The Rock: Yes.

414
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,789
Oprah: And yet, it's the most powerful gift
that we can all give.

415
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,600
And that's the real magic to life.

416
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:00,210
So, after everything that you've been through,
particularly this past week, what are you

417
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,739
now most grateful for today?

418
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:06,570
The Rock: I'm most grateful for life.

419
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:13,679
I'm most grateful for an opportunity, I’m
most grateful for my family.

420
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,230
I'm most...

421
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
Gratitude is a big thing with me.

422
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,009
I mean, it is truly my anchor.

423
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:22,009
Yes…

424
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:23,009
Oprah: Mine too.

425
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:28,200
The Rock: It's my anchor, and I wake up with
a heart full of gratitude, and even in death

426
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,970
and even when things don't go right and even
though I didn't make it to the NFL me, making

427
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,639
it to the NFL was the best thing that never
happened.

428
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:40,019
Yes.

429
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,499
Because it also gave me a great sense of gratitude
to be here.

430
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:47,309
So, I would say that it would be...

431
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:51,429
And also, I want to tell you, and I’ll tell
you this Oprah, and I want to tell you guys

432
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:57,109
like I was so excited to come here and do
this with you and share a little bit of my

433
00:23:57,109 --> 00:24:00,629
story and background and any kind of wisdom
that I have learned over the years to share

434
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:01,629
with you guys.

435
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:06,019
But I want you to know that especially this
week of just, you know, laying my dad to rest

436
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:09,350
I needed this from you, and I thank you, truly.

437
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,350
Thank you.

438
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,350
Oprah: Thank you.

439
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,350
Thank you.

440
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:32,282
The Rock: Thank you.

441
00:24:32,282 --> 00:24:33,282
Thank you so much.

442
00:24:33,282 --> 00:24:34,282
I did.

443
00:24:34,282 --> 00:24:35,499
I love you back, I truly do.

444
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:36,710
Oprah: That’s a good mana y'all just gave.

445
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,190
It’s a good mana.

446
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,779
The Rock: Thank you.

447
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,779
I did.

448
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,240
I needed this and I needed this.

449
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,649
I needed the love and this mana because what
I also realized is and I felt it coming in

450
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:50,700
is that you know you go to Rock concerts and
things and events and wrestling matches or

451
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,870
whatever.

452
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:57,669
But you know, when you come to this room and
you have thousands, 12, 13, 15,000 people

453
00:24:57,669 --> 00:25:02,970
who have one intention which is to be better
and give so much love and receive so much

454
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,399
love, it's a powerful thing.

455
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:06,360
Oprah: Yeah, it is a very powerful thing.

456
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,279
Thank you for being here today to share it.
