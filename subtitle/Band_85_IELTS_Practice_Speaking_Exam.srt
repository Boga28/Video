00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,320
Hello IELTS daily friends!

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,760
Welcome back to this practice mock exam.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,360
My name is Chris, and I'm here with Elisha.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,480
Elisha, where are you from?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,600
I'm from Singapore.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,200
Welcome! And in today session,

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
we are going to do a full practice test.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,440
Now, Elisha,

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,040
I think you've taken the test

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,400
before here at IELTS Daily.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,520
How did you do the first time?

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,120
I think I did pretty okay,

13
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,640
I made some minor mistakes in my pronunciation.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,200
So, if you want to see whether Elisha has improved

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,840
or stayed the same or done better,

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,600
then please come and watch this video.

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,440
We look forward to seeing you at the end

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,360
when I will give Elisha some feedback.

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,840
See you soon.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,040
Hello!

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,280
Do you think you have good pronunciation?

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,240
Well, in today's mock exam video,

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,920
we're looking at a mock exam with Elisha.

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,320
Elisha is a fantastic speaker,

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,040
and you may have already seen one of her videos.

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,800
She's come back for a second time

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,200
to answer some different questions

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,960
and we're going to evaluate whether

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,800
she has made the same mistakes as the first time.

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,480
So if you're ready, I'm ready.

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:12,980
Let's go!

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,400
Hello and welcome to this practice exam

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
conducted by IELTS Daily.

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,280
My name is Maddy, and I'm your practice examiner.

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,640
The questions in this test

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,240
are designed to simulate the IELTS speaking test.

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,200
Let's start.

38
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,720
What's your first name, please?

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,400
My first name is Elisha.

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,920
Thanks, Elisha.

41
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,240
At the beginning of the IELTS test,

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,640
you will be required to provide some ID,

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,400
but as this is a practice test,

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,840
we don't need to do that today.

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,320
I want to begin by talking about you.

46
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,480
What is the weather like

47
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,840
in the town where you live?

48
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm currently living in Melbourne,

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
so the weather here is pretty bizarre

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,440
in the sense that there's always

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,920
like four seasons in one day.

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,840
So, it could be sunny one day, one second,

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,720
and then the next,

54
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,600
it could be really cold and windy, and yeah,

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
but back home in Singapore,

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,360
it's really hot and humid,

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,840
and it's just constantly summer all year round.

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,560
So yeah, it's a good change

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,840
living in Melbourne currently.

60
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,960
We'll just pause there for one second

61
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,880
and Elisha elaborated;

62
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,040
she expanded on her answers really well,

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,240
gave lots of examples.

64
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,920
She talked about the place where she lives now,

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
and the place where she comes from.

66
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,760
I almost caught just the

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,040
pronunciation of good change.

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,640
She said: goot change.

69
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,920
It was probably a little bit soft, the D.

70
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,800
I think that would be okay.

71
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
If she makes many more of those,

72
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,960
then maybe she would drop to a band 8.

73
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
But she's okay for now,

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
she's using great language,

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,400
lots of complex variety in her grammar,

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,760
and she's very fluent.

77
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,800
So well done, Elisha.

78
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,840
Do you prefer hot or cold weather?

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,720
I would say that I prefer

80
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,360
cold weather because I think

81
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
I was exposed hot weather in summer in Singapore,

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,840
so it tends to,

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,360
it tends to be really hot there,

84
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,600
and I like to change it up a bit.

85
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,200
So coming to Melbourne,

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,400
I got to experience

87
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,800
like winter and all four seasons.

88
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,760
But in Singapore,

89
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
I only really experience summer.

90
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,400
Remember that I always tell you

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,840
to speak as much as possible.

92
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,320
Give lots of feelings

93
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,000
and thoughts on your answers.

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,080
Elisha is doing a great job here.

95
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,240
Fantastic language,

96
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,520
fantastic grammar,

97
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,320
no mistakes,

98
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,480
really clear, great pronunciation.

99
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,440
Good job, so far.

100
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,440
What do you normally do if the weather is nice?

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,840
If the weather's not too cold or too hot,

102
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,480
Ok, I'm just gonna pause her there.

103
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,120
Did we all hear that really,

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,640
a common problem for Elisha,

105
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,800
she said: col weather.

106
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,240
And it's this D sound that sometimes

107
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,680
is missing from her word.

108
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,880
So it should be cold.

109
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,519
D, D, D, D, cold weather.

110
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
So if we hear many more of those,

111
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,840
she will lose a pronunciation mark.

112
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
I tend to like to go out with my friends

113
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
or just go out and explore the city

114
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,040
And you know, do an activity

115
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,880
or like going to the beach

116
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,400
or having a nice picnic.

117
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,840
So I think, it, yeah,

118
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,400
it really depends on the weather, I would say.

119
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,180
Okay.

120
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,800
Let's move on to the topic of furniture.

121
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,800
Do you ever buy furniture?

122
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,560
I don't usually buy furniture

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,880
because currently I'm still student.

124
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,600
So,

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,040
I don't really have to buy

126
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,240
my own furniture, but. 

127
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,400
Should I pause, Elisha there again?

128
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm still student.

129
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
I didn't quite hear,

130
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,320
you might want to listen back.

131
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,320
I'm still A student, so it's this article.

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
She might have slipped it in,

133
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,360
I might have missed it.

134
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,960
Maybe you can go back and listen again.

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,080
I heard: I'm still student.

136
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,440
I would say:

137
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
I'm still a student, a student.

138
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,760
And most of the time,

139
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,320
my parents would just buy the furniture for me.

140
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,640
And I'm currently staying in college,

141
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,120
so this, pretty much everything provided,

142
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,680
like a bed,

143
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,000
a desk and everything,

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
all the things that I need,

145
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,680
but if I were to move out by myself,

146
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,800
I think it would be nice to find me,

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,640
stop buying furniture for myself

148
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,920
and choosing the things that.

149
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
If I were to finally move out by myself,

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
Great complexity of language,

151
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,520
it's an if sentence.

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
Try to use some different forms of grammar,

153
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,360
so an if sentence or a when sentence

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,280
or a subordinate clause,

155
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,240
if you don't know what those are,

156
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,520
you can Google those.

157
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
Make sure that you do have

158
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080
a number of different forms of grammar

159
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,840
or structures that you could

160
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,640
have a wide variety of grammatical structures.

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
I like to keep in my house.

162
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,840
How do you like to decorate rooms in your house?

163
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,840
So currently,

164
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,920
I'm living in a college dorm,

165
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,840
so I have a room to myself,

166
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,360
and I like to decorate it with all the things that

167
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,560
not only just remind me of my hometown

168
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
back in Singapore,

169
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
but also the things that really

170
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,640
brighten the room out,

171
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,760
it makes me really happy.

172
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,000
So currently in my room,

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
I have lots of plants and lots of posters,

174
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,120
and pictures of my family

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,400
and my friends back home.

176
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,080
And you know,

177
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,760
all the polaroids that I've taken so far,

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,680
since I've come to Melbourne.

179
00:06:59,440 --> 00:06:59,940
Okay.

180
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,920
You know.

181
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,640
You know.

182
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,960
Did you hear her use the phrase, "you know"

183
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
in the middle of the speech?

184
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,360
That's absolutely normal, that's great.

185
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,760
It's a great filler phrase, "you know",

186
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,120
it's a good idea.

187
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,360
So lots of students ask me the question,

188
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,680
can you say you in the test?

189
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,200
Yes, you absolutely can.

190
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,440
you should make sure that your speech is natural.

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,400
Native speakers use the phrases such as:

192
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,480
you know or like,

193
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,840
during their normal speech.

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,080
It is absolutely acceptable to use those.

195
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,800
Do you prefer traditional

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,480
or modern style furniture?

197
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,200
I would say that I prefer modern only because

198
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,680
like, I grew up in the household

199
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,120
that really just was more on the modern side.

200
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,360
So, yeah.

201
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
But I do like certain traditional,

202
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,400
and traditional set up and decorations as well.

203
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
But most of the time,

204
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,080
I tend to like modern furniture.

205
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,040
Now I want to talk about handwriting.

206
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,600
Do you have good handwriting?

207
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,920
I would say not really,

208
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,880
compared to a lot of my family and friends.

209
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
Only because I tend to write really fast

210
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,280
and I don't really pay attention sometimes

211
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,400
to the details and my handwriting

212
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,480
and the style that I used and. 

213
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
I just want to say how great

214
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,720
Elisha's fluency is.

215
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,240
I don't know if you agree with me,

216
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,720
but all of her sentences are connected together,

217
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,919
and they all flow from one idea to another idea.

218
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,479
It's not like she's looking for words.

219
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,520
She's not struggling or hesitating for language.

220
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,320
And actually,

221
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,560
she's not really hesitating for content, either.

222
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,080
She's doing a really great job

223
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
in the fluency and coherent section.

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,160
It also depends on what I'm writing.

225
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,600
If I'm writing an essay

226
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,360
that I need a hand in on an exam,

227
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,280
I would put in more effort

228
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,840
to actually have a handwriting that is readable.

229
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,080
But if it's just like journaling or writing notes,

230
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
like maybe the night before an exam,

231
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,800
I just tend to just mix,

232
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,600
like write down, as much as I can,

233
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,720
as fast as I can, so that

234
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
I can move on to the next topic.

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,920
Do you think your handwriting has gotten better?

236
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes, over time, I think it has.

237
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,480
I mean, compared to when I was a child,

238
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,920
I would say that

239
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
my handwriting was terrible and well,

240
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,120
I couldn't draw or just write anything.

241
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,640
Well, but over the years, I think it has improved

242
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,400
as I start to write

243
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,720
more essays and journals, and yeah.

244
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,400
How often do you write by hand?

245
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,600
I would say almost every day,

246
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,400
So I would say. 

247
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,720
I've heard Elisha say

248
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,960
this phrase a few times,

249
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,240
probably two or three other times.

250
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,920
Try not to use the same phrase all the time.

251
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,560
You could say:

252
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
I would say,

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,080
or you could even say: I'd say.

254
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,920
And that's even a variety.

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,440
I would say on, I'd say.

256
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,400
From my point of view, as I see it,

257
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,240
are other ways that you could

258
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,560
use language in that sense.

259
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
But try not to repeat

260
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
the same phrases all the time.

261
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,840
Cause it really depends,

262
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,840
like I write, like all the time.

263
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,600
There's never a day that I don't write,

264
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,240
and it could be for a diary entry.

265
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
Just to jot down the things

266
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,560
that I need to buy at the supermarket,

267
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,440
to assignments, essays and notes.

268
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,240
When I am doing my course in uni,

269
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,760
and when it's semester time,

270
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
I tend to write more than I usually do

271
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,640
especially during exam times,

272
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
because I have to write on a lot of things,

273
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,760
a lot of notes, yeah.

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm going to give you a topic,

275
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,720
and I'd like you to talk about it

276
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,320
for one to two minutes.

277
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,120
Before you talk,

278
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,920
you'll have one minute

279
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,520
to think about what you're going to say.

280
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,440
You can make notes if you wish.

281
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
Here is a paper and pencil making notes,

282
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,840
and here is your topic:

283
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
I would like you to describe

284
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,800
a piece of good news you received.

285
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,720
The time starts now.

286
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,800
Just before we listen to Elisha's speech,

287
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
A piece of good news,

288
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,040
remember that news is uncountable,

289
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,240
so you would always have to say

290
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,840
a piece of good news,

291
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,000
or you could say, some news.

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,880
You can't say, "a news",

293
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,209
so let's see what Elisha has to say.

294
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,580
Okay.

295
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:58,880
So, remember,

296
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,400
you have one to two minutes for this,

297
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,240
so don't worry if I stop you.

298
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,080
I'll tell you when the time is up.

299
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,680
Can you stop speaking now, please.

300
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,800
So, I remember vaguely,

301
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,400
a good, really good news

302
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,320
that I received was when I was about 7 years old.

303
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,360
And at that time,

304
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,640
My mom was recently like, diagnosed with cancer,

305
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,240
so I was extremely worried and sad.

306
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,080
And I was confused and worried

307
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,480
about what would happen in the future.

308
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,040
So, the news, like, I was really happy when

309
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,520
I received that she was,

310
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,560
she didn't have any more

311
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,400
cancer cells or tumors in her.

312
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,680
And I was relieved because

313
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,880
it was about a year or so that she had cancer,

314
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,520
and it was, if I can recall clearly,

315
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,840
it was like stage two cancer.

316
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,600
So when I received the news,

317
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,400
I was extremely relieved and happy,

318
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,840
and yeah, it made me really also

319
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,600
appreciate spending time with her more

320
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,320
and spending time

321
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
with the people that I love more.

322
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,560
And that made me,

323
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,200
that taught me a lot about

324
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,120
quality time with your loved ones and all.

325
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,920
But that, that is one of the very many,

326
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
good news that I have received.

327
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,740
Again,

328
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,720
That was one of the very many good news.

329
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,560
So she's fallen into this trap again,

330
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,960
of the countable and the uncountable.

331
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,720
News is unaccountable,

332
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
so you can't say, "many good news".

333
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,840
You would have to say,

334
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,200
"many pieces of good news",

335
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,400
or "some good news",

336
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,840
or "a lot of good news".

337
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,000
And yeah.

338
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,480
How did you celebrate?

339
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,480
We went out for a nice dinner,

340
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,280
and yeah, it was really good

341
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,840
because all my family

342
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,160
and my friends as well in primary school,

343
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,520
they were really supportive

344
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,440
and they were also really worried as well,

345
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,000
because there was a period of time that

346
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,200
she had a relapse,

347
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,520
and she was in the hospital for weeks.

348
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,360
So I think, when she was finally cured,

349
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
everyone was just very happy.

350
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,400
My dad was really happy,

351
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
and my siblings as well.

352
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,520
Because I had a younger sister,

353
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,840
and I was really worried for her,

354
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,600
but it's all good now.

355
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:21,860
Alright.

356
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,960
Emotional topics in the IELTS test,

357
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,400
you are not expected to give

358
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,080
as much personal information

359
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,160
as you don't want to do.

360
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,680
So if you feel like this is something

361
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,560
which is a topic which is off-limits,

362
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,560
or you don't want to cover,

363
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
you're absolutely welcome not to cover.

364
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
Elisha has told a personal story

365
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,320
about her mom and some health conditions.

366
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,120
If you think that

367
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
that's not something that you could talk about,

368
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,080
talk about something different,

369
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,720
and you could invent a story.

370
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,760
Only talk about things

371
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,320
which you feel comfortable discussing.

372
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,400
Well, thank you.

373
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
Now, let's talk about news.

374
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,280
What type of good news do people receive?

375
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,440
There are many different types of good news.

376
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,760
I would say, it depends on the situation.

377
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
So, for example:

378
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,640
Good news could vary from person to person,

379
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,080
and I would say that good news could be like

380
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,480
receiving a job that you really want to get into,

381
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,160
a course, a university that you wanted to go to.

382
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,800
You know, getting like, my example,

383
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,920
for example, like,

384
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,840
finding out that your loved one

385
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,800
isn't sick anymore.

386
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,680
And you know,

387
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,080
it just really depends

388
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,480
on the person and the context,

389
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,840
and how you receive it and feel about it.

390
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,160
How do people celebrate

391
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
good news where you live?

392
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,600
I would think,

393
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,760
it's pretty common

394
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,480
when you receive good news is to always celebrate.

395
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,080
The first thing to do is celebrate with drinks

396
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,480
or cake and throw a party,

397
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,840
a small get together.

398
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,440
And just, you know,

399
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,480
celebrate the person that received good news.

400
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,880
Another pronunciation feature here is: throw.

401
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
You will see below, throw,

402
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,280
if you listen back, you will hear that.

403
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,400
Alicia pronounces it, "throw", with a "ch.

404
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,120
Now, this is very common for people

405
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,440
from Malaysia or Singapore.

406
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
The pronunciation of the "th" sound

407
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,760
will often be "ch".

408
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,480
Alright.

409
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
I think the examiner would mark them down on this,

410
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,440
because it's not natural.

411
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,360
We wouldn't normally say, "chrow",

412
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,720
so you have to focus on "th", throw.

413
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,920
Like, for example, when my sister also,

414
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,120
she just got a job in London,

415
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,840
we couldn't be there to celebrate with her,

416
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,400
but we, because of the pandemic,

417
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,480
but we've like FaceTime with her,

418
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,280
and we celebrate it with cake,

419
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,800
and you know,

420
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,359
send her gift, all those,

421
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,039
well and got her nice things

422
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,760
to decorate her apartment as well.

423
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,680
So, it really depends

424
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,400
also on the situation, and yeah.

425
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,439
How can the good news of one person

426
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,640
affect other people?

427
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,080
I think it also depends if,

428
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,240
Like, I was really,

429
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,240
to me, I was really happy and you know,

430
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,560
believed that my sister found a job

431
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,680
because she was, she just graduated from uni.

432
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,320
And given the whole pandemic,

433
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,000
it was really extremely hard to find a job

434
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
because a lot of people that I knew

435
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,080
were losing jobs, and they were,

436
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,040
they were not doing so well as well, but. 

437
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:58,880
Alright.

438
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,480
So, "given the",

439
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
This is a complex grammar form.

440
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,560
Given the pandemic, something happened.

441
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,160
So I, remember I told you

442
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,200
that you need to have

443
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
varied complexity of your grammar.

444
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,560
We've talked about if sentences,

445
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,160
but a given sentence is also

446
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,800
a really great type of complex grammar form.

447
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,200
So given something, something else happens.

448
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,360
I think I was really happy for her.

449
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,840
So another situation where I was really happy

450
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,560
was when my friend got into

451
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,280
her dream university and dream course

452
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,040
and I was really proud of her.

453
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,240
So it really depends,

454
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,960
because I'm pretty sure her close friends

455
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,560
and family would be very proud and happy for her.

456
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,240
But strangers, probably not.

457
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,880
So it depends on how close you are to the person.

458
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,440
And if the person's really close to you,

459
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,960
they tend to also share

460
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,200
the same, similar feelings,

461
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,200
and happiness for you as well.

462
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,920
Thank you very much.

463
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,760
That is the end of the speaking test.

464
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,840
Wonderful!

465
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,320
Great job, Elisha!

466
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
I think it's important

467
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,760
that you watch Elisha's speech

468
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,360
and see how fluent she is.

469
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,200
She really developed some of her answers.

470
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,840
And talks a lot about

471
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,560
her feelings and her experiences.

472
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,400
This was a great example.

473
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,920
Shall we look at her mark?

474
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
Well, we've already spoken a little bit

475
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,760
about her pronunciation features

476
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,520
which were the "d" sound, and also the "th" sound.

477
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,040
I think a strict examiner would give her

478
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,600
an 8 for pronunciation.

479
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,440
Because in the band descriptors,

480
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
you will see them on the screen now.

481
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,080
It says:

482
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,160
uses a wide range of pronunciation features.

483
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,040
It says:

484
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,520
sustains flexible use of features

485
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,720
with only occasional lapses.

486
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,320
And this is the important feature here,

487
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,800
the only occasional lapses.

488
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,080
She does make a couple of mistakes occasionally,

489
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
and I think the examiner 
would pick her up on that.

490
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,080
Next,

491
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,240
with the fluency and coherence part of the mark,

492
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,800
she does repeat a few words.

493
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,360
So she says, "tends to", quite a lot.

494
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,440
And I would say, she says quite a lot.

495
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,920
And she says, "it depends" quite a lot.

496
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,640
And at a band, 8, it says:

497
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Speaks fluently, with only occasional repetition.

498
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,720
I'm not sure whether

499
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,840
the examiner would pick up on

500
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,640
the repetition of ideas and words and phrases.

501
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,080
For me,

502
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm going to be a little bit strict today

503
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,440
and give her a band 8.

504
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,240
I think she could score a 9 quite easily,

505
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,520
but just beyond the cautious side,

506
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,960
we will give her an 8 today.

507
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,920
Otherwise, her lexical resource

508
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
and her grammatical range and accuracy,

509
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,640
I'm going to score her 9 for both of those,

510
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,360
which would give her

511
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,800
an overall score of a band 8.5.

512
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,200
Remember,

513
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
if you want to score 9 overall,

514
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,600
you have to score 9 in all the sections,

515
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,320
which is extremely, extremely difficult.

516
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,640
Really well done to Elisha today.

517
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
We focused on pronunciation,

518
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,840
a couple of pronunciation features

519
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,200
which were really important,

520
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,800
and brought her score down.

521
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,840
I don't want you guys

522
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
to be in the same boat as she.

523
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,800
So therefore, make sure you pay attention

524
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,600
and focus on pronunciation.

525
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,480
I really hope that you enjoyed this video today.

526
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,880
