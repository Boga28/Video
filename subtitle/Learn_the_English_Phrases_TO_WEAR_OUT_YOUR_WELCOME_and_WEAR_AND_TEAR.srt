1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:01,630
In this English lesson,

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,610
I wanted to help you
learn the English phrase,

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,570
to wear out your welcome.

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,230
When you wear out your welcome,

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,160
it means you're visiting someone

6
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,460
and you've stayed longer
than they wanted you to stay.

7
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,510
Here's a good example.

8
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,797
If I was to visit my
sister, and if she said,

9
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:17,450
"Hey, you can stay two nights."

10
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,940
And if I stayed for a whole week or two,

11
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:23,330
I would definitely be
wearing out my welcome.

12
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,500
So when you wear out your welcome,

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,180
it means you go somewhere
and you stay too long

14
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,970
or you eat too much food or
you do something that means

15
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,470
that changes the situation

16
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,870
and you're no longer welcome there.

17
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,340
It's not good to wear out your
welcome at someone's house.

18
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,530
By the way, this phrase
came from Aleksey Konkov.

19
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:42,870
Thank you so much for
talking about this phrase

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,180
in the comments in a
video a couple days ago.

21
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,130
I realized that I hadn't taught it yet.

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,580
The next phrase I want to teach you today

23
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,430
is the phrase wear and tear.

24
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,720
In English, when something
has a lot of wear and tear,

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,280
it means it's getting old.

26
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,200
We usually use this to
talk about something

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,670
like a machine or an
appliance or a device.

28
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,250
So your phone can have
a lot of wear and tear.

29
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,810
If you drop your phone a lot

30
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,910
and if you use it for two or three years,

31
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,800
it starts to get scuffed on the corner.

32
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,180
Maybe the glass on the front
is cracked a little bit.

33
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,500
It has a lot of wear and tear.

34
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,960
When humans use machines
or devices or appliances

35
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,310
or any of those kinds of things,

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,550
they usually have a lot
of wear and tear on them.

37
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,760
They start to wear out a
little bit after awhile.

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,280
There's a phrasal verb that
kind of means the same thing.

39
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,350
So it's not good,

40
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,920
but it's just part of how
the world works, isn't it?

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,390
So to review.

42
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,050
When you wear out your welcome,

43
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:37,680
it means you go somewhere
and you either stay too long

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,840
or you eat too much food or
you do something that makes it

45
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,650
so you're not welcome there anymore.

46
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:43,520
It's not a good thing.

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,110
And when something has
a lot of wear and tear,

48
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,770
it means that it is starting to look old.

49
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,090
Maybe it's scuffed.

50
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,560
Maybe it's rusty.

51
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,470
Maybe it's even a little bit broken.

52
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:56,830
I know my one van is starting
to show a lot of wear and tear

53
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,870
because we've been using it for so long.

54
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,880
Anyways, let's look at a
comment from a previous video.

55
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,110
This comment is from Ricardo,

56
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:05,943
and Ricardo says,

57
00:02:05,943 --> 00:02:08,937
"All us adventurers are
used to running risks.

58
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:11,047
"What would life be like without risks?

59
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,100
"Honestly, I don't know, but
for sure, pretty boring."

60
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,247
And my response was this.

61
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:17,700
"Sometimes you have to take a risk."

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,200
So a few of you mentioned that

63
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,660
in the last lesson, in the comments,

64
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,830
a few of you mentioned
that sometimes in life,

65
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,320
it's good to take risks.

66
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,070
Sometimes in life, taking
a risk can be exciting.

67
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,840
Maybe you want to start a business

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,710
and you're not sure you
want to take the risk.

69
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,130
Sometimes it's good to take the risk.

70
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,990
Sometimes it's good to
try something brand new

71
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,390
just to see if it will
work, and I would agree.

72
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,960
I took a risk a long time
ago making a YouTube channel.

73
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,710
I think it was a good idea.

74
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,450
Anyways, I want to talk a little bit about

75
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,260
the phrase wear and tear

76
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,670
because this piece of equipment here,

77
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,320
this piece of farm equipment behind me,

78
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,440
you'll notice if I bring
the camera down here,

79
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,640
I'm not sure if you can see it,

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,210
you'll notice that tire is
supposed to be straight,

81
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,510
but it's sitting like that.

82
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,590
If we look at the tire on the other side,

83
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,730
this is a manure spreader by the way,

84
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,470
you'll notice, I'm gonna
spin you around really fast,

85
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,320
sorry about that.

86
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:17,690
You'll notice that this
tire is nice and straight.

87
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:20,800
So this manure spreader
has been experiencing

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,660
a lot of wear and tear.

89
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,260
It is quite old.

90
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,530
By the way, we use this
to spread composted manure

91
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,010
onto the flower beds.

92
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,940
You'll notice it's quite rusty.

93
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,830
It actually sometimes has
Wasps or Hornets living in it,

94
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,900
but it's definitely seen better days.

95
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,280
There's another fun
English phrase for you.

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,280
And somehow, I'm going to
have to get this tire fixed.

97
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,600
Luckily Jen's dad is really
good at fixing things.

98
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,470
Sometimes he comes down and helps me,

99
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,010
but hey, it's the nature of farming.

100
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,310
Sometimes things break.

101
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,870
Anyway, it's Bob the Canadian here.

102
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,190
Hope you're having a good day.

103
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,853
Thanks for watching this little lesson.
