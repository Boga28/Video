Teacher Prix what's the difference between
go to go in go for that's what you're going

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:20,470
to learn in this video coming up hey student
I am Teacher Prix and I’m going to help

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:28,339
you talk to anyone anywhere anytime in English
now this preposition mix well that's a common

4
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:33,690
question for English learners it is a vocabulary
lesson to help you improve your conversation

5
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,690
skills and comprehension as well so guys let's
dive into the content okay when we use go

6
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:48,840
to that's actually the most common combination
you will find with the verb go I was once

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,840
reading an advanced book and basically they
even gave a percentage okay in 95% of the cases

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:06,740
you will see go + to when when you're
showing movement in the direction of a place

9
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:13,170
that's the most common situation of go + to okay whenever you're giving me that idea

10
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,810
that you're going to a place in the direction
of a place you will use the preposition to

11
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:25,520
plus go for example I’m going to Boston
next week no I’m not going to Boston next

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,590
week I would love to but I can't my best friend
goes to work by bike okay he uses his bicycle

13
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:41,220
so my best friend goes to work by bicycle
not true my best friend goes to work by by

14
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:50,979
subway I think yes by subway sometimes by
uber well he can so you go to okay Linda

15
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:57,600
and Peter went to Portugal last month and
had a great time okay well I don't know Linda

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,270
and Peter but I have a student who went to
Portugal a few months ago and she loved that

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:10,889
it was amazing she visited her family it was
great okay now some disclaimers here even

18
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:18,950
though you use go + to to indicate in
the direction of a place with the words home

19
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:32,410
home yes there here somewhere uptown downtown
no okay you don't use the preposition to you

20
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:39,410
just use the verb go okay hey what are you
doing where are you going well I’m going

21
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:46,680
uptown for a meeting do you need a ride I’m
going uptown for a meeting do you need a ride

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,270
maybe I’m driving uptown okay I’m going
uptown and my friend or my sister or my wife

23
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,940
or my husband asked me what are you doing
where are you going I’m going I’m going

24
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,220
to a meeting uptown okay I’m going uptown
I’m going uptown for a meeting so this would

25
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,880
be possible no to. I’m going uptown for
a meeting there you have it no to hey where

26
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,570
are you going I’m going home but it's five
I know I need to go home

27
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:20,260
there you have it so no to okay with these
words home there here go there go here go

28
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:29,540
somewhere go there you have it another common
construction with go to is to use go to and

29
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:40,690
another verb to indicate the reason the purpose
to something I went to the beach to relax

30
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:48,320
okay so I went to the beach to relax very
nice I’m going to Boston to meet my friend

31
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,650
I’m going to Boston to visit my friend in
this case the preposition to here is giving

32
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,630
purpose okay I I’m actually even going in
a different direction here I say where I’m

33
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,190
going I’m going to the office to do something
I’m going to school to do something I’m

34
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:13,500
going downtown downtown no preposition too
okay I’m going downtown to do something

35
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:20,070
this is a very common construction with the
verb go then to the place then to the purpose

36
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:27,520
okay the thing you're going to do so I’m
going to my parents’ house to see my family

37
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,620
I’m going to my parents’ house to my parents’
house not home okay I’m going to my parents’

38
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,720
house to visit my family oh but teacher couldn't
I use home here I’m going to my parents’

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,530
home no you use house okay it's not your
home home is usually more personal it's my

40
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:54,280
place my beautiful home when I’m going to
other people's houses I usually use the word

41
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:02,030
house instead of home there you have it now
go for okay so this is also a very common

42
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:08,970
construction and in this case you're going
to use go plus for the preposition for and

43
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:20,050
a noun okay now and o u w no n o u n now
so when we want to show the purpose of the

44
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:26,061
movement you're going somewhere but what's
the purpose pizza let's go for pizza ah I

45
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:32,110
love going for pizza all the time anytime
anywhere with anyone let's go for pizza we

46
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:39,410
need more pizza in the world why don't we
go for brunch it's it's 11 a.m. you know not

47
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:46,330
11 it's just an example it's already late
for breakfast so why not why not go for brunch

48
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:54,030
example okay why don't we go for a few drinks
someday you know maybe someone is talking

49
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,940
to you flirting with you and then the person
invites you to go for a few drinks to go for

50
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:03,740
a few drinks the person is not saying the
place itself the person is saying the purpose

51
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:11,010
where are we going well for drinks maybe more
let's stop there right and finally go plus

52
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:17,230

I make these lessons for you but now go in
it means to enter so let's take a look at

54
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,600
some examples when I go in there I always
enjoy the atmosphere when I go in there I

55
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,380
always enjoy the atmosphere so when I go in
that place when I go inside that place okay

56
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,760
inside that place that's the idea I’m entering
remember that in most situations you will

57
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:49,700
use to but here my idea is to enter therefore
I will use the preposition in I always enjoy

58
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,560
the vibe you know such a beautiful place I
love it okay maybe you're walking down the
