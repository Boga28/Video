1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,800
How do you get back to speaking
English and English fluency?

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,150
After some time,

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,440
a way maybe you have some disruption or

4
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:15,030
problem or something big and exciting
and good happening in your life,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,680
maybe something personal,

6
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:21,150
something work-related maybe
you moved across country and

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,600
English had to take a break.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,560
Maybe at this moment in your
life. It wasn't a priority,

9
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:32,730
but now you're ready to get back in the

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:33,630
saddle,

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,580
which means to return
to your English fluency

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,330
goals. I'm Gabby from
go natural english.com.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,130
I'm your American English teacher
and fluency coach here to help you

14
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,840
when you're ready to go back or return to

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,750
your English speaking practice. See,

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,550
I recently had to take a
break as well from making

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,420
English lessons because I
moved across the country.

18
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,020
And to be honest, I was overwhelmed,

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,110
but now I'm ready. I'm back.

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,590
And I am thrilled to be
here with this new lesson.

21
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,390
That's going to help you to understand
the three steps that you can

22
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,200
take to get back to your English speaking,

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,960
regardless of how long it's
been since you spoke English.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,590
So if you're ready to start
speaking English again,

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:36,570
to start practicing and to improve
your English fluency little by little

26
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:41,160
together, then let's go. Let's
do this. Let's get fluent.

27
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,380
Keep watching until the end of this video,

28
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:48,120
because I'm going to share a resource
that I made for you with all of my

29
00:01:48,121 --> 00:01:52,740
best English speaking
tips and practice ideas.

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,360
It's called the English fluency formula.
I'll tell you more about it at the end,

31
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,430
but first let's talk about the
best and easiest way to jump back

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,320
into English. Practice.
Find something fun.

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,650
Do you enjoy music? What about movies?

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,080
How about books or magazines?

35
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,380
When I want to return
to studying a language,

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,130
I always start with something
enjoyable, something light,

37
00:02:20,131 --> 00:02:23,220
something fun for me. That's music.

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,970
So I am always working on my Portuguese.

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,020
So for example, I'll listen to a song,

40
00:02:31,021 --> 00:02:35,190
maybe a Brazilian song
or a song from Portugal.

41
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:39,540
Something that is enjoyable to
me and I'll look at the lyrics.

42
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,260
I'll sing along and before I knew it,

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm practicing my Portuguese,
but it's not so stressful.

44
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,620
I'm not putting so much
pressure on myself to do

45
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:56,700
it by the books or to go back to a class.

46
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,570
It can be just five or or 15
minutes of doing something

47
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:02,404
fun.

48
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,300
And this will help you to improve
your fluency quickly, easily,

49
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:11,740
and in a fun way. So what
is fun for you? Is it music?

50
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,220
Is it a podcast, a movie, something else,

51
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,170
maybe journaling in English.

52
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,000
I would love to know what you consider
to be the most fun activity in

53
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,800
English. Next.

54
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:28,150
I want to encourage you to take
15 minutes and think about,

55
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:31,390
or remember your goals
for English speaking.

56
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,560
Because when you remember
why you want English fluency,

57
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,850
maybe for a better job to advance
your career, to make more money,

58
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,530
maybe to work or travel
abroad or even remotely online

59
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:45,364
nowadays,

60
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,750
why do you want to speak English fluently?

61
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,760
When you remember your reasons,

62
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,960
really your deep down personal reasons,

63
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,420
nobody else's reason, just yours.

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,670
This is what will motivate
you to return to your

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,230
English practice. Next, you
want to gather your tools.

66
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,030
What do I mean tools are your
materials that help you to learn

67
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,810
English? So this could
be an English textbook.

68
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:21,489
If you want to learn in a more traditional
way or an English class in person

69
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,750
or online, it could be
videos like this one.

70
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,100
Maybe you bookmark the go natural
English channel or the go natural

71
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:34,300
english.com website as a
resource to help you learn.

72
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,470
It's important to have
materials to help you learn.

73
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,210
So if you want suggestions on
what materials would be helpful,

74
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,290
just ask in the comments. And of
course, as you probably already know,

75
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:51,910
there are hundreds of English
lessons over@gonaturalenglish.com.

76
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:57,280
So we have your materials.
Now we need a plan.

77
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,450
What are you going to do with
these materials? Unfortunately,

78
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:04,990
it's not enough just to
buy an English textbook.

79
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,220
We actually have to open it.
We actually have to read it.

80
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,930
It's not enough to just subscribe
to go natural English on YouTube.

81
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:17,560
We actually have to watch
the videos, practice,

82
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,560
ask questions and internalize the lessons.

83
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,180
Maybe review them a few times in
order to really remember what you are

84
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:29,890
learning. Be patient with yourself.
Learning takes time and repetition,

85
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,760
but it's important to have a
plan. So let's think about it.

86
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,830
How often and for how long each time can

87
00:05:38,831 --> 00:05:43,750
you practice your English speaking
in what situations do you prefer

88
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:48,310
to study in a classroom or
from home or on your own?

89
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,010
What is your favorite way?

90
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,860
How do you want to learn English?

91
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:59,090
I think we're so lucky to be living in
a time where we have so many resources

92
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,140
at our fingertips and the ability to learn

93
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:07,970
independently more now than ever.
So let's take advantage of it.

94
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,410
Now you have your materials and you've
thought about how you're going to get

95
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:14,090
back into learning English.

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,840
There's one last thing I want
to encourage you to think about,

97
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,620
which is who is going to help you.

98
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:24,440
Who's going to keep you accountable. Now.

99
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,270
I personally have some fun ways
of keeping myself accountable.

100
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:33,620
For example, yesterday, I was doing
some work that wasn't really fun,

101
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:37,190
but I had to do it. And I
told myself, I said, Gabby,

102
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,030
if you finish this work,
you get to eat ice cream.

103
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:45,710
I know it's really silly. It's
I mean, it's just ice cream,

104
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:50,690
but that made me really excited to finish
the work so that I could treat myself

105
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,010
afterwards. Maybe for you it's ice cream,
maybe for you, it's something else.

106
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:58,070
Something else that you
enjoy doing or eating,

107
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,990
or maybe some exercise or
time with your friends or just

108
00:07:02,991 --> 00:07:07,970
something fun that you enjoy after
doing the work or the practice that

109
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,530
may not be as fun because let's be
honest. We can start with something fun.

110
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,940
Like I mentioned for the first
tip, but in order to learn,

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,150
you're going to have some challenges.
You're going to make mistakes.

112
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,540
You're going to have to push
through them and do the work,

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,550
focus on your goals to get
you through those challenges

114
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:32,750
and treat yourself along the
way. When you do the thing,

115
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,410
maybe it's grammar, maybe
it's speaking practice,

116
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,990
maybe it's working on your pronunciation.

117
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,630
What is your biggest challenge in English?

118
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,040
When you work on those
points, then treat yourself,

119
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,750
reward yourself.

120
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,760
And that's a great way to stay
motivated and get the work done so

121
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,780
you can keep yourself accountable.
But sometimes it's hard.

122
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,800
Let's be honest.

123
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,960
Self discipline is one of the most
difficult skills ever in life.

124
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,910
So you may want to consider
a tutor, a teacher, a coach,

125
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:11,480
to help you along the way.
Who do you want that to be?

126
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,900
I'm not trying to tell you it
should be me, but it could be.

127
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:19,100
You can certainly learn with
us@gonaturalenglish.com.

128
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,110
So let's review to get back to return to

129
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:27,560
your English learning.
We need three things.

130
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,360
I suggest starting with something fun.
And then you need to gather materials.

131
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,340
You need to make a plan and
find the person who's going to

132
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:41,720
keep you accountable and
cheer you on or motivate you

133
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,550
throughout your learning.

134
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,890
So if you think that this is a good
way to get back into English learning,

135
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,030
or if you have something to add, then
please let me know in the comments.

136
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,680
And I promised that I would tell you.

137
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,060
About the English fluency formula
online ebook that can help you

138
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,480
as a guide to returning
to your English studies.

139
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,730
It's not like a traditional textbook
it's short and really easy to read,

140
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,330
but it gives you suggestions
about where to focus,

141
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,100
what to study and how to
practice your English speaking.

142
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,240
So if you'd like to know more
about it and get your online copy

143
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,070

you. And I will see you again soon.

148
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:40,890
It won't be so long
this time. Bye for now.
