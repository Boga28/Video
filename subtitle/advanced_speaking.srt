00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello I'm Emma from mmmEnglish!

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,400
In this video, we're going to talk about four things

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,580
that you can do every day to improve your English.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,220
I think we can all agree that learning English

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,080
or learning any language takes time

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,300
and effort and dedication.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,900
But the most successful language learners, they find

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,260
a way for their language to become

9
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:28,200
a part of their daily life. It just becomes a habit

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,760
like brushing your teeth.

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,040
If you want to improve, your English practice should

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
become a daily habit.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,480
To help you with this I'm going to share four things

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,960
that you can and you should be doing every day

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,340
to improve your English and yes, I am suggesting

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,420
that you do all four things every day but they're not

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,080
huge tasks

18
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,560
and we're going to talk about how you can make them

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,800
a bit of fun too

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,100
so come check it out!

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,120
Before I share these four things

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,640
that you should be doing every day,

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,860
I want to thank our friends Lingoda

24
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,880
who've partnered with us to bring you today's lesson.

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,300
In particular, I want to share how the Lingoda Language

26
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,140
Sprint offers you daily English lessons plus

27
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,320
up to a hundred percent refund on your lesson fees.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,360
Lingoda is an online language school.

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,120
You take classes with qualified native speaking

30
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,280
teachers, class sizes are small

31
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,960
and all of the learning materials are provided. Plus

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,500
Lingoda are now Cambridge certified so you'll get free

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,020
access to the Cambridge online language test as well.

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,340
And in exciting news, the next Language Sprints

35
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,680
are starting soon.

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,160
The Super Sprint is the biggest challenge,

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,880
thirty classes a month for three months.

38
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,060
When I decide to do something, I like to go hard

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,500
and that is exactly what the Super Sprint

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,680
demands of you.

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,680
English classes every day for ninety days

42
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
but here's the thing,

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,560
if you complete every one of those classes,

44
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,820
Lingoda will give you your money back,

45
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,860
a hundred percent of your class fees refunded

46
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,940
or you can use the credits for even more

47
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:23,060
English classes. Now if that feels impossible for you,

48
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,480
then you can choose to do the Regular Sprint,

49
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,020
fifteen classes a month for three months.

50
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,180
If you complete all of those classes, you'll get a

51
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,460
fifty percent refund. So are you up to the challenge?

52
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,820
You can register for the Sprint promotion right now

53
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,500
but registrations close on the 24th of March.

54
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,680
The link is in the description below and if you use

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,360
this code JOIN1, you'll get ten euros off your deposit.

56
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,160
So the very first thing on my list is pronunciation.

57
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,600
Yes you should be practising your pronunciation

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,540
every day.

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,900
And it's not to try and get rid of your accent

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,640
but to make it clear enough that others

61
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,460
can comfortably understand you when you speak.

62
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,920
I can't tell you the number of advanced English students

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,800
I've had

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,820
who've had amazing grammar and vocabulary skills

65
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,080
but so much trouble communicating

66
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,380
because their accent makes it quite challenging

67
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,020
for others to understand them.

68
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,880
So of course, all of this affects smooth, positive,

69
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,060
comfortable conversation.

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,700
And depending on where you learned English,

71
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,780
your teacher may not have focused on pronunciation.

72
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,740
It may not have been the priority at the time.

73
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,760
You see, if you learned English at school,

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,740
your teacher's main aim was probably to get you

75
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,580
high marks in your exam. Pronunciation was

76
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,020
probably not their focus at that time

77
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,440
but in the real world when you're using English to speak

78
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,980
with other people, your pronunciation, your fluency

79
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,380
when you speak, it's so incredibly important.

80
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,040
Get into the habit of learning and using the correct

81
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,880
pronunciation today because it's going to save you

82
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,640
lots of headaches and confusion down the track.

83
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,840
Plus, practising your pronunciation every day

84
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,220
consistently, it's gonna help you to make noticeable

85
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,520
improvements in a short space of time.

86
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,720
So how can you start doing this?

87
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,779
I recommend that you learn the IPA,

88
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,780
the international phonetic alphabet.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,780
If you've never heard of it before

90
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,400
or you don't know a lot about it,

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,640
then watch this lesson up here.

92
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,800
But learning the IPA will allow you to correctly

93
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,380
pronounce every single English word

94
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,140
using

95
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,220
the

96
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,660
correct

97
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,100
English

98
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,540
sounds.

99
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,440
Another great way to practise your pronunciation

100
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,740
is with my imitation lessons

101
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,640
so in these lessons, I help you to copy me

102
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,560
and shadow me as I speak.

103
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,540
They're really awesome, quick ten minute videos

104
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,580
that you can practise with regularly so add them

105
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,980
to a playlist and keep coming back to them

106
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,740
and practise with them often.

107
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,460
After you've practised a lesson for a few times

108
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,220
make a recording of yourself

109
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,580
and compare it to my voice.

110
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,660
Try to identify some of the mistakes that you're making

111
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,860
with your pronunciation.

112
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,240
I've added a link to my imitation lessons

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,840
in the description and I'll add one at the

114
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,100
end of this video as well that you can check out.

115
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,460
You can also simply read out loud to improve

116
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,740
your pronunciation.

117
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,940
Doing this every day will help your mouth muscles

118
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,660
to get working and creating English sounds

119
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,180
and get more comfortable doing it.

120
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,860
It's as simple as that

121
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,540
and it doesn't need to take you long

122
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,040
just five or ten minutes a day is plenty.

123
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,800
Just make sure you're doing it consistently.

124
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,000
You could even do it by singing English songs.

125
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,340
Create one opportunity to absorb English every day.

126
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,460
To absorb is to take in information

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,980
so you're like a sponge soaking things up, taking in

128
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,200
new ideas, new words,

129
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,500
new ways of expressing yourself

130
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,800
and you can do this in lots of different ways,

131
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,460
so many ways.

132
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,040
Listening to a podcast or an audiobook,

133
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,760
you could watch an English movie

134
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,100
or any video on Youtube.

135
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,640
Read a book or a blog post, In fact,

136
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,660
you probably want to mix this up during the week, right?

137
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,460
To keep things interesting.

138
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,560
A podcast on Monday. Read a book on Tuesday.

139
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,440
Whatever floats your boat.

140
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,680
Now again, this doesn't have to be a huge

141
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,640
time-consuming task but it's worth spending some time

142
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,640
searching for the right type of content.

143
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,980
It must be stuff that is interesting for you.

144
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,640
If you're into football or you love makeup tutorials

145
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,580
or romance novels or soap operas.

146
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,700
If you love the idea of sailing around the world,

147
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,240
I've been watching a YouTube channel called

148
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,480
Sailing La Vagabonde and they vlog about their life

149
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,360
sailing around the world on a yacht.

150
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,020
In fact, if you're interested,

151
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,580
I've added the link in the description below.

152
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,040
But the point is, find something that interests you

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,860
and excites you because

154
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,660
you need to look forward to doing it every single day.

155
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,020
It shouldn't feel like you're doing English practice.

156
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,500
So I have two little recommendations here.

157
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,080
Firstly, you need to find the time that you're going to

158
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,100
do it and declare it. That is your daily time

159
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,440
to absorb English so it could be on the bus

160
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,720
on your way to work or while you're eating breakfast.

161
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,360
I've always found that attaching an activity to the task

162
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,780
helps you to make it part of your routine.

163
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,900
And while you're doing it, just keep a notebook handy

164
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,980
so that you can write down expressions or new words

165
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,940
which you can look up and check later on.

166
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,600
Simple as that!

167
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,840
Writing every day has some amazing benefits.

168
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,820
But before I talk about that I want to make it clear,

169
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,440
I'm not talking about writing an essay, okay?

170
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,860
I'm just talking about writing a few thoughts or a few

171
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,480
ideas down. It only has to take a few minutes

172
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,360
and nobody ever has to see it.

173
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,600
It's just for you. So there's a few reasons why writing

174
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,940
every day is an excellent habit to get into.

175
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,360
It helps your vocabulary to stick.

176
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,140
Writing is one of the best ways to recall

177
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,600
new words and expressions that you've come across.

178
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,100
When so many of my students have asked me

179
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,919
"What is the best way to remember vocabulary?"

180
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,079
this is my recommendation.

181
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,680
As you're reading or watching TV shows or books,

182
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,560
you come across new ideas and words

183
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,080
and you write them down but

184
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,920
then you start to use them yourself.

185
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,140
You think of sentences and your own ideas about

186
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,080
how to use these words.

187
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,800
That way you're producing your own sentences

188
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,540
rather than just listening to other people's

189
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,260
and it helps it just stick in your mind.

190
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,440
And then you can improve it.

191
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,000
Once you've written something,

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
you can do so much with it.

193
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,560
You can copy/paste it into a grammar checker

194
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,740
like Grammarly to help you to identify some of the errors

195
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,760
that you're making.

196
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,740
So Grammarly is free to use,

197
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,240
I've included a link in the description below

198
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,760
because it's awesome.

199
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,240
It helps you to see the mistakes that you're making

200
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,080
like maybe you're using the wrong preposition

201
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,860
or

202
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,740
you don't need to use an article when you've written one.

203
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,720
So I really recommend that you take a look to help you

204
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,600
see and realise the mistakes that you're making

205
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,820
and you can also review your own work.

206
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,160
Once you've finished writing, leave it for a few days

207
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,640
or a few weeks, come back to it.

208
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,100
See if you can make any improvements

209
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,200
or if you can use a thesaurus

210
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,300
to look up synonyms and replace some of the words

211
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,960
with more advanced ones.

212
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,540
These are just a few ideas but getting into a daily

213
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,100
writing practice creates so many opportunities for you

214
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,580
to apply what you've learned or what you've seen

215
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,500
or what you've experienced in English

216
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,420
and then review it and improve it.

217
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,620
Lastly, join an English discussion

218
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,860
about stuff that interests you.

219
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,040
Now this sounds serious and may be complicated

220
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,560
but it's not, I promise. I'm just talking about joining an

221
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,880
active group or online community

222
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
where there are people interacting.

223
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,080
They're sharing their ideas, they're giving opinions

224
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,240
and you're able to respond.

225
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,160
So you can comment and actually be part

226
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,400
of the discussion as it happens.

227
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,500
Now this could be in person but it can easily

228
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,360
be as part of an online community.

229
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,180
Plus that makes it, you know, even easier to create

230
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,540
a daily habit around it

231
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,100
because it's simply about checking in

232
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,880
and seeing what everyone else has been talking about

233
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,620
and giving your two cents worth.

234
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,040
So how do you find these places?

235
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,660
It takes a little work. You can't just Google 'cooking'

236
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,980
and join the first group that you find.

237
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,920
Join a few different ones, see which one is the most

238
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,060
active, which one has really interesting discussions

239
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,080
happening in it.

240
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,940
Sometimes nothing gets posted in these groups

241
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,100
for days and that's not really helpful for you, right?

242
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,780
So I would start by writing down

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,200
your top five hobbies or interests.

244
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,520
Don't start with English language.

245
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,740
What else are you into? Are you into

246
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,960
politics or yoga or marketing,

247
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,240
photography, sports. I mean you probably already follow

248
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,160
people or a part of groups that are like this.

249
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,960
So all you need to do is commit to checking in

250
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,300
once a day and write a comment.

251
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,760
It's not more complicated than that.

252
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,600
If someone shared something and they're asking

253
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,560
for opinions, don't keep scrolling.

254
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,840
It's an opportunity for you to share so stop,

255
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,240
think of a way that you can contribute.

256
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,540
Now I'm gonna add some great, really active

257
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,360
and interesting groups in the description below

258
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,180
just to give you a few ideas of what I'm talking about

259
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,040
but I want to know if you're already part of some

260
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,640
lively Facebook groups or other online communities.

261
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,260
What kinds of things do you discuss

262
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,140
and do you ever contribute?

263
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,040
So if you can bring those four things

264
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,340
into your daily routine in some way,

265
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,200
you will absolutely, without a doubt

266
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,720
improve your English.

267
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,020
Remember that it takes a little bit of time to create

268
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,820
good habits. It's not as simple as

269
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,300
deciding you're gonna do it.

270
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,060
So I've got a couple of extra tips to help you get started.

271
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,880
Do your research first.

272
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,380
Find a blog or a TV series that will keep you

273
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,120
interested so you don't have to look for something to do

274
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,400
okay? Give yourself a week or so to find the right

275
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,300
type of community to join and be part of the

276
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,540
discussions with.

277
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,900
Then create a regular schedule to help you get started

278
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,120
and really I just mean decide when you're going to do

279
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,400
these four things so for example,

280
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,980
pronunciation practice might be in the bathroom

281
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,240
for five to ten minutes every morning

282
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,200
as you're getting ready for work.

283
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,040
Then listening to your favourite podcast

284
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,940
on your way to work and you're writing down

285
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,440
your words on the bus.

286
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,100
On your lunch break, might be the time to check a

287
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,540
Facebook group and write a group comment.

288
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,040
Then spend ten minutes at the end of your day

289
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,700
writing about what you did

290
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,040
or what you learnt before dinner

291
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,100
and simply put that on repeat.

292
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,680
Very quickly you'll realise that English has become

293
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,760
a regular daily part of your routine.

294
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,600
Thank you so much for joining me today.

295
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,180

on Instagram and my Facebook here.

297
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,500
I hope that you found all of these ideas

298
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,400
and these suggestions useful.

299
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,900
Let me know if you're doing some of these things

300
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,440
already or if you're planning to put any of them

301
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,620
into practice, let me know how it goes.

302
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,380
And as promised, here is one of my imitation lessons

I'll see you in there!
