00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,440
Hey this is Emma from mmmEnglish!

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,600
I'm super excited that you're here and that you're

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,480
spending some time with me today

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,140
to improve your English.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,620
In this lesson we're going to be doing some more

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,620
speaking skills practice

7
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,020
and in particular, we're going to be practising

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,180
with the mmmEnglish Imitation Technique

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,680
which is one of the most effective ways

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,520
to reduce your accent and to fix

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,480
your pronunciation problems so that you speak

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,300
more clearly and confidently in English.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,820
And it's effective because it teaches you to listen

14
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,980
to the sounds and the patterns of English

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,020
and trains you to produce those same sounds yourself

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,140
through repetition and controlled practise.

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,040
You're training your mouth with your ears

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,020
by listening to the sounds and imitating them

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,680
rather than training your mouth with your eyes

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,340
by reading and guessing the pronunciation

21
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,440
and the rhythm of words on a page.

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,420
Now if you haven't done a lesson like this before,

23
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,560
don't worry, it's really simple and I'm going to explain

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,340
each step for you so that you know

25
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,280
exactly what you need to do.

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,040
You just need to get ready to speak out loud with me.

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,080
If you're new to my channel

28
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,220
or new to the Imitation Technique,

29
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,580
I've got some courses available via the

30
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:30,620
mmmEnglish website to help you practise this way

31
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,160
and you can find out more about them up here

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,860
or I've added the link in the description below.

33
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,840
To practise with the Imitation Technique, there's just

34
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,220
three simple steps that you need to follow.

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,240
The first one is, well you just need to listen to what I say

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,200
and read the words on the screen as I say them.

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,640
Next, you'll be listening to what I say

38
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,840
but then there'll be a pause so that you can repeat

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,700
what I said.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,100
You need to copy me exactly as you hear me.

41
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,000
This step, you can do again and again and again

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,400
until you sound or you think you sound exactly as I do.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,220
And it's okay to practise many times

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,260
before you move on to the third step.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,020
You can even slow down the speed

46
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,320
so that you can practise a little more slowly

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,880
before stepping up to regular pace

48
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,960
because step three is a challenge,

49
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,020
even for a native English speaker.

50
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,000
You're going to be listening to me and saying

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,440
what I'm saying at the same time

52
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,780
and that's pretty much like practising along to your

53
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,580
favourite song, right? You can't really do it straightaway

54
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,160
but with a little bit of practice it gets easier

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,560
and you'll start having fun.

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,400
Now although this step is also the trickiest one,

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,800
it's the best way to fine-tune your natural speaking skills.

58
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,940
You'll get to hear what I'm saying

59
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,740
and what you're saying at the same time

60
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,960
so that you can adjust the sounds and the rhythms

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,680
so that you can match me.

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,600
You are going to make a lot of mistakes but who cares?

63
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
We're going to have fun!

64
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,860
Today we're going to practise talking about a past trip.

65
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,340
Now I'm going to be sharing a story with you about

66
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,700
my recent trip to Portugal.

67
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,700
Talking about travel is a really great way to start a

68
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,940
conversation because there is lots of opportunity

69
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,280
to ask questions and to share your own

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,380
travel experiences with someone.

71
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,360
Keep in mind that you can easily exchange my story

72
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,200
with your own story about traveling as well

73
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,300
especially once you've been practising with me

74
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,500
for a little while.

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
All right? Let's get started.

76
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,000
Step one: listen and read.

77
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,680
I've just come back from a trip to Portugal!

78
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,140
Lisbon, actually.

79
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,420
Was a bit of a last-minute decision.

80
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,680
My friend was attending a conference there

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,980
and she convinced me to tag along!

82
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,740
I don't usually make spontaneous decisions like that

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,220
but it all just happened at the right time.

84
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,020
I actually didn't know that much about

85
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,380
Lisbon before I went.

86
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,640
Have you been?

87
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,980
I had no idea what an incredible city it is.

88
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,800
And oh my god, the food!

89
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,660
I ate so many pastéis de nata,

90
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,680
I thought I was going to burst!

91
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,440
The city is full of beautiful cobblestone streets.

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,100
I spent so much time just wandering around

93
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,540
in the sunshine, you know?

94
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,580
Winding my way through historic neighbourhoods.

95
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,780
Actually one of the coolest things we did was

96
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,780
jump in a tuk-tuk with a guide.

97
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,180
We went up this steep hill and had an amazing view

98
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,480
over the city.

99
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,720
You know what a tuk-tuk is, right?

100
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,260
It's like a little motorbike with a cabin on the back

101
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,280
where you can sit.

102
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
It was a really fun way to get around.

103
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,760
And easier than walking because

104
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,480
oh my god, it was so hot!

105
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,440
And our guide, her name was Paula,

106
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,740
she grew up in Lisbon and she was just a

107
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,000
wealth of knowledge.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,380
She was full of stories about her childhood

109
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,680
and about the history of the city.

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,620
She took us to cool little back streets and,

111
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,380
you know, we explored some amazing street art.

112
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,720
There's just no way that we would have found

113
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,900
all of those hidden gems ourselves.

114
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,600
I really wish we could have stayed longer!

115
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,240
I definitely want to go back there one day!

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,520
What about you,

117
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
have you got any travel plans coming up?

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,800
Now you need to imitate exactly what I say

119
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,060
and that means you're trying to copy my pronunciation

120
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,860
and my word stress and even the pause in my sentence.

121
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,520
You could even try and copy my facial expressions

122
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,920
to practise communicating with more than just words.

123
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,120
There's going to be a pause after each sentence

124
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,280
so that you can practise out loud with me okay?

125
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,460
Or after me.

126
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,500
So just relax and go with the flow.

127
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,040
It's just you and me here right now, okay?

128
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,460
So let's just have some fun.

129
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,980
Step two: listen and imitate.

130
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,300
I've just come back from a trip to Portugal!

131
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,560
Lisbon, actually!

132
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,720
Was a bit of a last-minute decision.

133
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,380
My friend was attending a conference there

134
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,400
and she convinced me to tag along!

135
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,360
I don't usually make spontaneous decisions like that

136
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,180
but it all just happened at the right time.

137
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,240
I actually didn't know that much about Libson

138
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,540
before I went.

139
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,100
Have you been?

140
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,980
I had no idea what an incredible city it is!

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,920
And oh my god, the food!

142
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,960
I ate so many pastéis de nata,

143
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
I thought I was going to burst!

144
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,740
The city is full of beautiful cobblestone streets,

145
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,960
I spent so much time just wandering around

146
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
in the sunshine, you know?

147
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,420
Winding my way through historic neighbourhoods.

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,420
Actually, one of the coolest things we did

149
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,060
was jump in a tuk-tuk with a guide.

150
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,220
We went up this steep hill and had an amazing

151
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,620
view over the city.

152
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,080
You know what a tuk-tuk is, right?

153
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,119
It's like a little motorbike with a cabin on the back

154
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
where you can sit.

155
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,340
It was a really fun way to get around,

156
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,800
and easier than walking because

157
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,840
oh my god, it was so hot!

158
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,240
And our guide, her name was Paula,

159
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,120
she grew up in Lisbon,

160
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,720
and she was just a wealth of knowledge.

161
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,860
She was full of stories about her childhood

162
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,820
and about the history of the city.

163
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,980
She took us to cool little back streets

164
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,340
and, you know, we explored some amazing street art.

165
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,360
There's just no way that we would have found

166
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,640
all of those hidden gems ourselves.

167
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,760
I really wish we could have stayed longer!

168
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,680
Definitely want to go back there one day.

169
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,000
What about you,

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
have you got any travel plans coming up?

171
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,700
Now we're moving on to step three

172
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,200
which is a little more challenging.

173
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,720
Don't forget that you can pause here right now,

174
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,960
go back and practise section two as many times

175
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,990
as you need to before we keep going.

176
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,540
This is going to take a little bit of practice but right now

177
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,340
you need to shadow me and that means

178
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,940
listening and speaking at the same time.

179
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,820
Try to copy the rhythm and the tone that I use

180
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,840
even if it means you get a little tongue-tied at first.

181
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,080
It doesn't matter.

182
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,580
Step three: shadow.

183
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,760
I've just come back from a trip to Portugal!

184
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,220
Lisbon, actually!

185
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,340
Was a bit of a last-minute decision.

186
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,860
My friend was attending a conference there

187
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,260
and she convinced me to tag along.

188
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,620
I don't usually make spontaneous decisions like that

189
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,140
but it all just happened at the right time.

190
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,520
I actually didn't know that much about Lisbon

191
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,440
before I went.

192
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,480
Have you been?

193
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,840
I had no idea what an incredible city it is!

194
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,940
And oh my god, the food!

195
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,740
I ate so many pastéis de nata,

196
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,740
I thought I was gonna burst!

197
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,520
The city is full of beautiful cobblestone streets.

198
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,000
I spent so much time just wandering around

199
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,580
in the sunshine, you know?

200
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,740
Winding my way through historic neighbourhoods.

201
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,800
Actually, one of the coolest things we did

202
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,900
was jump in a tuk-tuk with a guide.

203
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,720
We went up this steep hill

204
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,480
and had an amazing view over the city.

205
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,760
You know what a tuk-tuk is, right?

206
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,520
It's like a little motorbike with a cabin on the back

207
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,600
where you can sit.

208
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,660
It was a really fun way to get around

209
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,840
and easier than walking because

210
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,680
oh my god, it was so hot!

211
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,580
And our guide, her name was Paula,

212
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,800
she grew up in Lisbon

213
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,820
and she was just a wealth of knowledge.

214
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,520
She was full of stories about her childhood

215
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,720
and about the history of the city.

216
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,880
She took us to cool little back streets and,

217
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,600
you know, we explored some amazing street art.

218
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,720
There's just no way that we would have found

219
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,840
all of those hidden gems ourselves.

220
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,780
I really wish we could have stayed longer!

221
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,520
Definitely want to go back there one day.

222
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,720
What about you

223
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
have you got any travel plans coming up well?

224
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,120
Wow! Congratulations for making it through!

225
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,960
What a mouthful that was!

226
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,060
Make sure you save this lesson to a playlist

227
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,740
and keep coming back to practise with me.

228
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,480
Once you get comfortable telling my story,

229
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,740
then you can try adapting your own travel stories.

230
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,140
In fact have you been to Portugal or had a trip like mine?

231
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,980
Let me know about it in the comments.

232
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,020
I'm super curious. Portugal is amazing!

233
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,360
Many of you have been requesting

234
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,820
more Imitation Lessons lately

235
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,280
so that you can practise your speaking skills with me

236
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
so let me know what lessons you want.

237
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,360
Do you want conversations about work, about travel,

238
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,920
about disagreeing with someone or arguing?

239
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,120
Let me know what you want in the comments and I'd be

240
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,160
really happy to make them for you.

241
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,680
