Pull off, put off, go off, drop off, pay off! What 
do all these phrasal verbs mean? Let's find out!

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,920
Hello my dear friends and welcome to English 
mania! My name is Antonia Romaker and today  

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,280
I'll teach you five popular phrasal verbs  

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,240
with the preposition off. The 
first phrasal verb is to pull off.  

5
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,040
To pull off means to succeed in doing 
something quite difficult or unexpected.  

6
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,840
You want to run a marathon tomorrow! 
Are you sure you can pull it off?  

7
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:08,640
How long have you been training? You haven't! Wow! 
I don't think you will pull it off. Who knows?  

8
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,800
So running a marathon is a challenge and 
succeeding in doing it would be quite  

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:27,520
impressive. So a person would pull it off, succeed 
in doing something difficult or unexpected.  

10
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,160
My friend pulled off an incredible surgery! 
So it was quite difficult, challenging

and he pulled it off, he pulled 
off an incredible surgery.  

12
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:50,560

think that I pulled it off. Reducing prices at  

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,720
today's climate will be a difficult trick to pull 
off. It will be difficult to succeed in doing it.  

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
Reducing prices at today's climate 
will be a difficult trick to pull off.  

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:14,960

car. Put the car into first and pull off slowly.  

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,840
My driving instructor would say that to me 
like a thousand times: and pull off slowly.  

17
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,960
So you start moving in a car. 
You can also pull off the road  

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:40,640
and then the meaning is the opposite. It means 
to stop driving, pull off the road for a coffee.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,240
To put off can mean to delay an event 
or an activity for a later time or date,  

20
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:06,160
you put it off, you decide to do it later. 
Never put off till tomorrow what you can do  

21
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:18,320

conversation. There is one more meaning,  

29

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,200
make up your mind and do something! Do you 
think you should pay the criminals off?
