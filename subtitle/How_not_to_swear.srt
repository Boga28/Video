1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:13,824
Hi, feckers. How you doing? Sometimes, you
want to say bad words. But sometimes -- just

2
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:24,909
sometimes -- people get angry if you use bad
words. I'm going to teach you how not to swear.

3
00:00:25,514 --> 00:00:27,590
I'm also going to teach you
how to swear. Perfect.

4
00:00:27,616 --> 00:00:33,940
So we have these words in English called "curse",
"swear", or "bad words". Okay? These are words

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,940
that people -- some people -- think are bad.
Part of the reason why people believe that

6
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:48,473
they're bad is people who are very religious
-- so if you find yourself in the middle of

7
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:53,050
America, which means you're not on the East
Coast; you're not on the West Coast; you're

8
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:59,069
kind of in the middle, smack-dab, or if you're
in Calgary or Edmonton or some places in Canada

9
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:09,023
where people are really Christian, a lot of
them do not like it when you say "shit". So

10
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:12,135
you have to choose a different word.
I'm here to teach you this.

11
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:20,724
So "damn" -- now, "damn" has the religious
background. So "damn" is like, "Damn you all

12
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,143
to hell." "Damn" is a bad word because they're
basically going to hell and not going to heaven.

13
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:37,214
So instead of saying "damn", people say "dang"
or "darn". "Darn it!" Some people go as far

14
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:46,104
as to say, "Rats!" My grandmother's favorite, "Oh,
dash!" Now, my grandmother was from Scotland,

15
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:53,270
so I think this is kind of a Scottish translation
of "damn". People in movies say "goddamn".

16
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:57,251
That's pretty bad if
you're really religious.

17
00:01:57,277 --> 00:02:06,431
Then, for all the people out there, "Oh, my
God." It's been shortened now to "OMG". Did

18
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:15,394
you know that "OMG" meant "Oh, my God"? Did
you know that? So this, maybe, I think, is

19
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:22,663
an acceptable way for people to get around
saying "Oh, my God." I wonder if really devout

20
00:02:22,689 --> 00:02:26,058
Christian people like to say "OMG".
I don't know.

21
00:02:26,084 --> 00:02:32,000
So instead of saying "god", all they do is
replace it with either "gosh" or "goodness".

22
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:37,933
So instead of saying, "Oh, my God", you can
say, "Oh, my gosh" or, "Oh, my goodness."

23
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:44,340
For me, personally, I would say these words
because I'm not religious. But, like I said,

24
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:51,364
some people get a little bit freaked out if
you use bad language. So just to be nice,

25
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,562
this is what you're going to do.

26
00:02:52,588 --> 00:03:02,692
Now, at a work place or in a very formal environment,
people do not like it when you say swear words.

27
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:08,463
Now, swear words are typical things like "fuck",
"shit", "bullshit", "bitch", "mother fucker",

28
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:16,311
"horseshit", "son of a bitch". These words are
considered bad. These are bad words. Personally,

29
00:03:16,337 --> 00:03:23,739
Ronnie loves bad words. Ronnie says bad words
all the time. It's hard for me to not say

30
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:34,366
bad words sometimes. So in an environment
like my job, I cannot use bad words. If I'm

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,549
going for a job interview, I don't want to
drop the F-bomb: What's the "F-bomb"? The

32
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:46,795
"F-bomb" is just the word "fuck". People don't
like the word "fuck". They think it's bad.

33
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:52,545
So they can say, "Ronnie dropped the F-bomb
in the job interview. We're not giving her

34
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:59,715
a job." Don't say "fuck" in a job interview
unless you're a porn star; say it all you want.

35
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:07,139
We have the word "shit". Now, "shit" is
-- do you like my picture? "Unko" -- Japanese

36
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,300
for you. Shit is the stuff that comes out
of your bum. It is shit. It doesn't smell

37
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:17,459
nice. It's terrible. If you are Irish, you're
going to say "shite". My father once said,

38
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,460
"That's shite." And I was like, "That's cool.
That's shite." I got in shit because I said

39
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:28,389
"shite". Apparently, "shite" is a bad word,
too. Some people don't know "shite" is a bad

40
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:36,002
word, so you can say it. Go test people. People
like to say "crap" because it's poo, or "poop".

41
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:45,789
"Crap" and "poop" are just shit, okay? "Bologna."
And you go, "Hey, isn't that a place in Italy?

42
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:50,520
What do you guys have against the place in
Italy? Is it terrible?" No, but "bologna"

43
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,520
is sandwich meat, and -- I don't know how they
get this, but people go, "sandwich meat."

44
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:04,170
Not "salami", though; "bologna". "That's bologna."
It's chicken. I don't know where this came

45
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:12,526
from. And a play on the "crap" is "crapola".
"Holy crapola!" "Oh, crapola!" "That's crapola."

46
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:21,714
All of these words are replacements for "shit"
or "shite". "Holy shit" is a surprise. Again,

47
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,467
we have the "holy", like God took a shit.
So "holy shit", again, with the religious

48
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:34,971
people, is considered bad because it's a holy
shit. Double swear here. So people will say

49
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:42,310
"holy cow" or "oh, snap". I don't know how
that works, but these are what people have

50
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:48,739
replaced this with. I think Bart Simpson from
the Simpsons said, "Don't have a cow, man

51
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:54,645
", but I don't think he said "holy cow". He
definitely was not allowed to say "holy shit".

52
00:05:54,671 --> 00:06:01,589
On most TV programs, they are not allowed
to use swear words or bad words. In Canada,

53
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:09,444
you cannot use them until after 9 p.m. So
after 9 p.m., on most TV stations, it's okay

54
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:16,470
to say "shit". Woohoo! Freedom of speech.
Freedom of speech has happened. Fuck.

55
00:06:16,496 --> 00:06:26,203
You can say "frick". You can say "frak". You
can say "fek". My personal favorite -- or

56
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:34,203
as I called everyone today -- "feckers". "Fek",
again, is the Irish word for "fuck". I don't

57
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:40,639
know if it really means "fuck" or if it's
just the accent and the way they say it, but

58
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:46,337
I say "fek" all the time. I have an it shirt
that says "fek". Even my mother doesn't know.

59
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:48,218
Okay?

60
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:59,268
Then, we have this word that's "eff". So you
could be funny and put "eff you". "Oh, eff

61
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:03,465
me?" "Eff you" means "fuck you", but you
can't say "fuck", so you say, "Eff you."

62
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:11,197
And then, you have the -ing. So sometimes, you
want to say something like, "This is fucking

63
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:20,598
tasty. I love it." But that's a bad word, so
you can say, "This is flippin' delicious"

64
00:07:20,624 --> 00:07:36,080
or, "This is effin' wonderful." "This is freakin'
great." "Frig" also means "fuck". "Fudge"

65
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,508
-- if you're really, really, really angry,
and you want to say a bad word, you can say,

66
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:51,344
"Oh, fudge!" "Fiddlesticks. Fiddlesticks!
Fiddlesticks!" I really don't know how they

67
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:58,833
get this other than it has the same F sound.
So "effin'", "freakin'" "frig", or "friggin'".

68
00:07:58,859 --> 00:08:05,973
"Fudge", "fiddlesticks", the "F-bomb", "frick",
"frak", "fek", "flippin'", and "eff" -- they

69
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:08,534
just mean "fuck". Okay?

70
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:20,233
In this one, actually, we have to put f-l-i-p-p-i-n'
because when you're going to replace the swear

71
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,389
words, you've got to get the
spelling correct, too. Okay?

72
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:30,943
Then, we have one of my favorites, "bullshit".
"Bullshit" means someone's telling you something

73
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:38,344
that you think is not true. So for example,
if I said to you, "I'm going to give everyone

74
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:48,444
watching this video $10,000." You can say,
"That's bullshit, Ronnie." Or if you don't

75
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:56,397
want to say "bullshit", you can say, "Hey, that's
BS." It just means "bullshit" or "bullspit".

76
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:06,414
Bull's spit. Okay? "That's bull spit." Okay?
Or you could just say, "That's bull". When

77
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,976
I was a child, I think I said "bullshit" once,
and I got in trouble. So I said "BS", and

78
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:14,329
that was fine.

79
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:23,974
Even more outrageously crazy is "horseshit".
Okay? Bullshit -- maybe bulls shit a little

80
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,970
bit. Horses -- goddamn. They shit a lot. "Horseshit"
is 900 times bigger and better than "bullshit".

81
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:42,120
So if I said to you, "Not only will I give
you $10,000, I am going to give you a car.

82
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:47,208
You can come to Canada and live in my house.
And I will cook you food every day." You would

83
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:54,002
say, "Well that, right there, is a load of
horseshit, Ronnie" because none of this is true.

84
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,650
But if you want to say a bad word for "shit",
you can say "horse pucky". "Pucky" means "poo",

85
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:02,848
horse poo. "That's horse pucky."

86
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:09,480
Now, some of these ones, when I look at them or
think about them, they make me giggle because

87
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:17,857
to me, it's really, really, really American,
and it's really the middle states of America,

88
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:24,029
and these people are really, really, really
Christian. So they say, "That's horse pucky."

89
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:29,060
I kind of have to do it with a little Texan
accent. "You kind of got to kick your heels up."

90
00:10:29,357 --> 00:10:34,348
This one, people don't like this. "Mother
fucker". People hate when you call them a

91
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:40,736
"mother fucker". Okay? So instead of saying
this -- maybe you've seen this, "MoFo". "Hey,

92
00:10:40,762 --> 00:10:46,880
MoFo." "MoFo? What's a MoFo?" "MoFo" is "mother
fucker". Okay? In TV, again, they're not allowed

93
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,880
to say "mother fucker". Some movies,
they don't say this, so they say "MoFo".

94
00:10:54,714 --> 00:11:01,339
These are funny. Instead of saying "mother
fucker", you can say "monkey father". "Hey,

95
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:11,984
you, monkey father, I don't like you at all.
Or even worse, "Look at you being a melon

96
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:20,974
farmer. Do you grow melons? You're a bad person."
"Hey, melon farmer, I'm going to kill you."

97
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:28,894
Somehow, it doesn't have the same punch as
"mother fucker". These swear words or these

98
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,953
bad words are things that we have developed
in our society to think that they're bad.

99
00:11:35,008 --> 00:11:41,579
"Bitch" -- "bitch" has two meanings. One, it's
a female dog. Two, it's a nasty -- there's

100
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:50,914
three. It's a nasty woman. Or four, it's a
man in jail who does everything for you. So

101
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:59,860
we also have the word "biatch". You've heard
this before, haven't you? So people will say,

102
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:04,745
"Hey, bitch." "Bitch" is a bad word, so they
say "biatch". It's in a lot of rap music,

103
00:12:04,771 --> 00:12:12,924
too. Then, we have, maybe, you "son of a bitch".
That's just like "mother fucker". That's just

104
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:19,000
bad. "You insulting my mama?" So instead of
saying "son of a bitch", people say "son of

105
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:29,398
a gun". Your mother had sex with a gun. Is
that better? Or "SOB". "He's a dirty SOB."

106
00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:32,561
Son of a bitch. SOB.

107
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:39,399
I have a special request or special saying
that I'd like to teach you guys. And it's

108
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:46,399
from the Indian language, and it's "benchod".
Apparently, "benchod" means "sister fucker".

109
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:54,884
But it also means "great pleasure". I haven't
quite figured that one out yet. Is it good?

110
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,750
Is it bad? Maybe it's great. Maybe it's slang.
If you want to learn more slang, check out

111
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,310
more slang videos on EngVid.

112
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:13,020
Why would you not want to swear? How not to
swear. Why don't we just swear all the time?

113
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:19,273
Job interviews, workplaces -- if you ever
meet my mother, don't swear in front of her.

114
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:24,330
Some people -- a lot of older people don't like
it when you swear. It's rude. It's vulgar.

115
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:30,490
Some people think it's obscene. That's cool.
Everyone has their own opinion. So if you

116
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:37,490
need to think of ways not to swear, gosh,
golly, gee, you've got it right here. See

117
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,625
you later, y'all.

118
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:45,329
"This is a frackin' joke." "Oh, give me a
frackin' break." "Shut the frack up." "Get

119
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:49,468
to the frackin' point." "I fracked up." "Come,
mother fracker." "You can tell me I fracked

120
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:50,606
up." "Tell me I fracked up."
