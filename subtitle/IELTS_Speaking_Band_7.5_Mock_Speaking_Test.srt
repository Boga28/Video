1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:03,503
(bright upbeat music)

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:19,500
- Okay, so let's start off
by talking about your work.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,850
Do you work or do you study?

4
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,820
- I'm currently working,

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,980
I finished my studies two years ago,

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,253
so I'm currently working as a pharmacist.

7
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:30,140
- And where do you currently work?

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,880
- I currently work in Dublin.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,030
I came in Dublin a few months ago.

10
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,823
I worked previous in
Romania from where I am.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,840
- And why did you choose that career?

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,173
- Well, I think my mother
has some influences on me.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,020
She's an assistant and she always

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,020
thought that pharmacy will suck me

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,900
and it's a easy job
and, or respected jobs.

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,670
So she kind of pushed me to do pharmacy.

17
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,707
So I chose pharmacy in the end.

18
00:01:03,707 --> 00:01:05,203
- And do you enjoy your job?

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,970
- I do now.

20
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,620
When I was in Romania, I
didn't like it that much.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,640
But now in Ireland the system is different

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,820
and I feel more appreciated for my work.

23
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,070
So it starts to grow on me.

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,903
- Good.

25
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:22,623
So now let's talk about your hometown.

26
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:26,000
So where are you from?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,450
- I am from a small town in Romania,

28
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,320
so I grew up in a really small town

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,320
and then I moved to a
larger city near to my town

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,950
and it's called Negresti.

31
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,070
So it's difficult for
foreigners to pronounce it.

32
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,083
- And do you like your hometown?

33
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:48,730
- I didn't like it when I was a child.

34
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,660
I like it now because it's a small town,

35
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,480
a small community where
you can raise your children

36
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,730
with no problems with no bad influences.

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:01,720
So it's a good place where you can grow up

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,563
and be a decent person.

39
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:08,389
- How often do you visit your hometown?

40
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,289
- Now that I'm living in Ireland

41
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:15,020
probably I will visit
once or twice a year.

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,463
But when I lived in
the other city in Iasi,

43
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,513
I went to Negresti maybe twice a month.

44
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,910
- And how do you think your
hometown could be improved?

45
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,060
- Well, because it's a small community,

46
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,160
maybe just improve the job offers,

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,000
try to raise the local economy.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
Most of the people that are living there

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,990
are farmers or they are
working in construction.

50
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,983
So maybe just improved that
part and they can live better.

51
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,370
- Now let's talk about your childhood.

52
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,680
Did you have a nice childhood?

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,910
- Yes, I did.

54
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,090
Like I said, it was small community,

55
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,670
so my parents knew every
neighbors that we had.

56
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,420
They weren't afraid to leave me with kids

57
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,780
on the street just to play
or let me out in the night

58
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,140
to going with my friends to have some fun.

59
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,993
So it was nice.

60
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,293
- What is your first memory?

61
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,770
- My first memory is a funny one.

62
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,170
I was two years and a half and
I run from my grandparents'

63
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:33,170
house to go to Kinnegad
where my aunt was going.

64
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,400
So I missed her so much
that I ran out of the house

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,683
and come back with her a few hours later.

66
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,194
- And when you were a child,

67
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:47,460
what did you want to be when you grew up?

68
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,760
- I only loved medicine,
pharmacy science in general.

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,760
So I knew I would be a biology teacher

70
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,540
or doctor or pharmacist,

71
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,543
something that related
with the science part.

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,393
- And what hobbies did
you have as a child?

73
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:09,140
- I tried a lot of hobbies.

74
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,950
I tried singing.

75
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,970
I tried sports.

76
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,290
I did actually karate.

77
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,220
I did a lot of them, but I never found one

78
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,580
that it suits me 100%.

79
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,423
So I don't think I have a hobby.

80
00:04:27,195 --> 00:04:28,028
- All right.

81
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:29,240
That's the end of part one.

82
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,980
We're gonna move on to part two now.

83
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,620
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna show you

84
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,810
a cue card with a topic on it.

85
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,370
You should read the cue card

86
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,390
and you will have one
minute to prepare an answer.

87
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,610
After that one minute,

88
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,940
I'll let you know when
the one minute is up

89
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,900
and you should speak about the topic

90
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,425
on the cue card for up to two minutes.

91
00:04:51,425 --> 00:04:52,684
Is that okay?

92
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:53,623
All right.

93
00:04:53,623 --> 00:04:55,480
Here's the cue cards.

94
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,753
I'll start the stop watch.

95
00:05:00,814 --> 00:05:03,981
(bright upbeat music)

96
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,360
- Please speak for up to two minutes.

97
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,970
- So I'm going to talk
about my first computer

98
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,623
that I got when I was like
eight or 10 years old.

99
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,530
Back then we didn't have
an internet connection,

100
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,950
so it was pretty easy to use it,

101
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:37,130
especially for a kid that did

102
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,230
some computer science in school.

103
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:44,050
So basically I used it
only for basic games

104
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:48,030
that I already had
pre-installed on my system

105
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,050
or listen to music or movies

106
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,530
that I borrowed from my friends.

107
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,530
It wasn't hard for me to
learn a computer science

108
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,980
on that one because with the
develop of the technology

109
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:09,560
we got also a computer or
internet connection in our house.

110
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,070
So practically I started to grew up

111
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,160
on the same time with the technology.

112
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,720
So now the main benefits
that I'm getting from that

113
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,790
are me knowing to use and
discover more utilities

114
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,940
of the computer, new programs.

115
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,160
I can manage to solve my own problems

116
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,163
with the computer hardware or software.

117
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,340
I also don't have any
difficulties when it comes

118
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,333
to work to solve a problem
with my system at work.

119
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,620
Also I think because we
as a generation grew up

120
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,810
with a computer in our houses,

121
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,450
we got a lot of advantages of this because

122
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,870
nowadays everyone is depending on

123
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,680
a smart device or a computer.

124
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,575
So that helped a lot and I even start--

125
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:11,408
(laughs)

126
00:07:11,408 --> 00:07:14,920
- So that's the end of part two.

127
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,990
And we're gonna move on to part three.

128
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,170
All right.

129
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,010
So we've been talking about technology

130
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,660
and we're gonna continue to talk about

131
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,520
technology for a little bit.

132
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,240
And we're going to talk about technology

133
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,480
as it relates to education.

134
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,537
So the first question is,

135
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:34,840
"Do you think someone can learn a language

136
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,160
using an online course?"

137
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,920
- Yeah, I just did that.

138
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,340
It's not like I learned a
language, a new language.

139
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,930
But an online course can help as much

140
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,000
as a face to face teacher can help you

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,750
if it's a good course and it
has enough explanation on it,

142
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,750
they can help you a lot
to get the information

143
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,530
that you are missing.

144
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,820
So, for example if we are
speaking about a vocabulary course

145
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,820
for a beginner, a good course
will provide the learner

146
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,570
the basic words, the basic grammar

147
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,040
and everything that they have to know

148
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,190
in the beginning of
learning that language.

149
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,400
- And should schools use more
technology in the classroom?

150
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,510
- I think so because children nowadays use

151
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,510
their smart mobiles and
smart devices all the times.

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,720
So they are very familiar with technology

153
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,530
and schools should really
improve their classrooms.

154
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,570
I don't know about Ireland in general,

155
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,870
but in Romania we didn't have
computers in our classrooms.

156
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,870
We had only one with computers

157
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,090
and the rest were all old books.

158
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:06,090
So every new information that
we got it came from books

159
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,200
and not an actual technology piece or

160
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,340
let's say we are studying biology,

161
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,690
it's easier to study
something that you can see 3D

162
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,313
like we Taylor Graham's
than seeing him in book.

163
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,760
- And do you think one day
AI Artificial Intelligence

164
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,580
will replace teachers in the classroom?

165
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,650
- No, I don't think that because a teacher

166
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,990
can come with some experience in the back,

167
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,890
can come with more than
Artificial Intelligence can bring.

168
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:46,890
It's a personal experience
that a student can correlate

169
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,240
with the lesson and remember
that particular story

170
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,300
from the teacher's
experience and correlate it

171
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,250
with what he learned.

172
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,430
So I don't think a computer could do that

173
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,300
even though it's programmed to be like

174
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,820
an Artificial Intelligence.

175
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,720
I don't think it will accomplish that.

176
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,900
- Now let's talk about
technology and society.

177
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,870
So has technology improved
how we communicate

178
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,440
with each other?

179
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,273
- It has.

180
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:23,313
If we are speaking about
smartphones for example,

181
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,410
now we can. 

182
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,700
Not only can call each other.

183
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,750
We can text in a few seconds.

184
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,440
We can video call.

185
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,980
We can use the internet
connection to see each other

186
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,170
from big distances like
I am with my family.

187
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,090
The smart device that I'm
using is helped me a lot

188
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,053
to keeping in touch with them.

189
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,880
- And why are some people now reducing

190
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,363
the amount of time they
spend on electronic devices?

191
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:01,510
- I think at some point we got overwhelmed

192
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,690
by the technology around us.

193
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,110
And now people are trying to realize that

194
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,580
the social connection
that are between people

195
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,850
are starting to fade.

196
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,850
So they are trying to
restart a real connection

197
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:25,900
between people and give up a
little bit of social internet

198
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,593
and actually doing some socialization.

199
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,190
(laughs)

200
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,023
- Okay, good.

201
00:11:35,023 --> 00:11:35,856
Well done.

202
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:36,689
That's it over.

203
00:11:36,689 --> 00:11:37,522
You can breathe now.

204
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:40,260
You can relax and you
ended up with socialization

205
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,269
at the end.

206
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,290
(laughs)

207
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,210
All right, good.

208
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,760
So now I am gonna give you some advice.

209
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,750
And I'm basing this
advice on the fact that

210
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,910
you've done the test three times now.

211
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,840
You got a band six the
first time in speaking,

212
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,290
then you got seven and then you got eight

213
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,180
in speaking before.

214
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,790
So you're continually improving.

215
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,790
And what we want to do
with you is to make sure

216
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:11,070
that next time you do the test
that you absolutely want 100%

217
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,970
are going to get at least
the score that you need.

218
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,470
Because as a pharmacist
you need a band seven.

219
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,840
What you're struggling a little bit

220
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,540
with writing at the minute,

221
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:24,540
but sometimes students will
focus so much on writing

222
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,970
and let's say they're at a band seven

223
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,660
for speaking and they'll
focus so much on writing

224
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,650
and they forget or they
just are a little bit

225
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:35,790
complacent when it comes to speaking.

226
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,623
So what we're gonna. 

227
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,010
The advice I'm gonna give
you now is to make sure

228
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,600
that you would never fall below a seven

229
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,623
and to make sure that you get there.

230
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,760
So first of all, I'm
gonna go through each part

231
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,010
and then I'm gonna go through
the four marking criteria.

232
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,010
So you did something in part
one which is very common

233
00:12:55,451 --> 00:13:00,451
where you were a little bit
nervous in the beginning.

234
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,810
So when we're talking about work,

235
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,650
you were a little bit more hesitant,

236
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,740
shorter answers, and
that is totally normal.

237
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,200
And most examiners will
expect that because

238
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,502
part one is important but it is designed

239
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:19,900
to let you ease into the
test and to let you warm up.

240
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,490
So that's why they ask
you questions about work,

241
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,250
about your hometown, about your home

242
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,290
which you know, are quite easy questions

243
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,060
to try and get you warmed up.

244
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,350
- And as you went through

245
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,120
when you were talking about your hometown

246
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,210
and more when you're talking
about your childhood,

247
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,040
you were talking far more fluently.

248
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,250
You were developing your answers.

249
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,550
It was more relaxed.

250
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,830
So when you're talking about work,

251
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,120
it was like not robotic but,

252
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,900
when you're talking about
hometown and childhood

253
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,530
is like talking to a
friend all by yourself.

254
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,927
If you and I were in a coffee
shop when I was saying,

255
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,260
"Did you have a nice childhood?"

256
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,450
you're like, "Yeah, I did."

257
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,430
And just talking naturally.

258
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,840
And that was great to see.

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,970
So part one was really good.

260
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,990
The examiners would never
listen to your first few answers

261
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,890
that were a little bit,

262
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,020
let's say there were a
little bit short fluency,

263
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,430
a little bit hesitant.

264
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:12,980
They would never base their score

265
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,600
on those first few answers.

266
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,460
So some people watching now,

267
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,160
we'd be like, "Oh, she
gave one short answer."

268
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,970
She gets a band six like that's not

269
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:25,250
how the examiners think or how
the marking criteria thinks.

270
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,100
The examiner will base
their score on the totality,

271
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,490
your total performance.

272
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,790
Not on one short answer or one answer

273
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,300
where you hesitated for example.

274
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,940
So for part one and the length was good.

275
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,240
You really eased into it.

276
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,170
Your fluency was excellent.

277
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,910
Some nice vocabulary in there,

278
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,450
some grammatical errors.

279
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,240
But we'll talk about
that when we talk about

280
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,363
the four marking criteria.

281
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,430
I think part two was the
area that you struggled

282
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,580
with a little bit compared
to the other parts

283
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,980
cause there was a lot of pausing,

284
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,100
a lot of hesitation.

285
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,750
So your fluency wasn't as good in part two

286
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,583
as it was in part one and part three.

287
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,690
I'll tell you why I think but

288
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,210
it's always good to hear from the student.

289
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,297
Why did you think that you
were struggling or did you. 

290
00:15:15,297 --> 00:15:17,670
You didn't do a bad job by the way.

291
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:20,633
It's just in comparison
to the other parts,

292
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,950
there was more audible
pauses and like, "uh, uh."

293
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,803
- Yeah, I've noticed that myself.

294
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,820
Maybe because I try to. 

295
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,740
I forgot about some ideas
that I had in my head

296
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,740
and I tried to see if I got
all those thoughts on the card.

297
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,900
I know I don't have to
speak about all of them.

298
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,190
They are just guidelines.

299
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,190
But at some point I felt stuck
and didn't know what to say.

300
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,880
So maybe that's why with the long pauses.

301
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,480
- So the audible pauses
are normally caused

302
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,380
by one of two things.

303
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,380
One is linguistic, related to
grammar related to vocabulary.

304
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:13,003
So you're tryna think of the
correct word for example.

305
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,430
The other one is related to ideas.

306
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,370
People tryna think of content,

307
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,360
basically things to say.

308
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,690
Was it linguistic?

309
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,650
Were you trying to think
of the correct vocabulary

310
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,880
and grammar or was it just ideas?

311
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,713
- Ideas.

312
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:27,546
- Ideas.

313
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:31,730
So the examiner will
also notice that because

314
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,530
if you are constantly
stopping because you're trying

315
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,970
to think of the correct verb
tense or trying to think

316
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:38,360
of the correct vocabulary,

317
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,720
that's a signal to the examiner
that you have a problem

318
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,540
with the English language.

319
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,120
If you're just pausing
because you're just tryna

320
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,110
think of the next thing to say,

321
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,700
that's not really a problem
with the English language.

322
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,530
It's more of a problem with the subject.

323
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,090
And so the examiner should
take that into account.

324
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,070
But one of the things that
I noticed that you did,

325
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,280
which normally causes a drop in fluency

326
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,640
related to content is you
listed a lot of things.

327
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,609
So you're like. 

328
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,316
So for example it could be,

329
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:14,420
"I went to the shop when I got bananas,

330
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,609
an Apple and cheese and
cereal" and you're tryna

331
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:20,149
think of the next thing and the next thing

332
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,250
and the next thing.

333
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,470
It's much easier just to
pick one of those things.

334
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,500
So you're talking about
software versus hardware

335
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,600
and go a little bit deeper into that

336
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,420
until at a story related to
that or example related to that.

337
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,350
Because I think a lot of
people go through part two

338
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,010
and they're just like okay,
"I need to talk about this,

339
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,660
let's list a lot of things with that."

340
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,910
Then this, list a lot of things.

341
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,240
And then you run out of time
or run out of things to say.

342
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,480
So I think when you're
doing the real test,

343
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,350
don't be afraid to go
very deep into one thing

344
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,180
and especially pick one thing

345
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,190
that you're comfortable talking about.

346
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,580
Like, for example, "When
I was a little girl

347
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,530
I got Windows 2000" or something like that

348
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,463
and how the changes that it
made were blah, blah, blah.

349
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:08,980
" And I really learned a lot

350
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,970
about programming through that."

351
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,767
So that's much better than,

352
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:14,793
"We had Windows and we
had Adobe and we had this

353
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,760
and we had this and we had this."

354
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,907
You see what I mean?

355
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:18,740
- Yeah.

356
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,983
- It just makes it easier
for you to be more fluent.

357
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,030
So I think that's the
only in terms of fluency

358
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,710
and coherence, that's
the only area of concern

359
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,543
that I would have.

360
00:18:30,543 --> 00:18:34,350
- You weren't like, your
fluency wasn't terrible.

361
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,020
But well just making sure that

362
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,820
you would never go below a seven.

363
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,820
And if that topic sounds
like something you know

364
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,730
a lot about it but if
you've got another topic

365
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,730
that you don't like, that could
turn into a problem for you.

366
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,930
And part two is such
a big part of the test

367
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,670
that if you get a topic
you are uncomfortable with

368
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,680
plus you're tryna think of content

369
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,080
that can really drag
down your fluency scores.

370
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,120
So that would be my main bit of advice

371
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,200
to go deep on a few things
you feel comfortable

372
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,970
talking about rather than
trying to list everything.

373
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,114
- Now I got it.

374
00:19:15,114 --> 00:19:19,010
- And examples and stories are great.

375
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,270
Like the story you told about
when you're a little girl

376
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,540
running after your auntie,

377
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,940
you're very fluent because
you're just talking naturally

378
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,450
and it's much easier to talk
about something you know

379
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,330
than to try and think of something

380
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,150
completely abstract and
to list lots of things.

381
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,080
- But overall I thought it was good

382
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,850
cause you got to the two minutes

383
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,267
and that most people don't
get to the two minutes.

384
00:19:42,267 --> 00:19:44,660
And speaking in a foreign
language for two minutes

385
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,023
it's not easy.

386
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,810
For part three I think
you did really well.

387
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,520
For part three you had no
problems with any of the questions

388
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,217
and a lot of the questions
like for example,

389
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:56,527
"Will AI replace teachers?"

390
00:19:56,527 --> 00:19:58,950
"Why are some people reducing their time

391
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,850
on their electronic?"

392
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,570
Those are difficult questions
and the examiners will. 

393
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,520
If they think that you
are seven or band eight

394
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,590
or a band nine, they'll
ask you more and more

395
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,250
difficult questions to see
if they can stretch you

396
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,340
and really test you.

397
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,222
So if you get difficult questions,

398
00:20:16,222 --> 00:20:17,450
that's a good thing.

399
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,283
Be happy.

400
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:19,940
If they ask you really simple questions

401
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:22,880
then you might have a problem

402
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,720
but you coped very well
with those questions.

403
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,390
- I liked the way that you
answered the questions,

404
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,610
gave an explanation, gave
an example to help you

405
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:36,750
fully answer, fully develop the question.

406
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,260
So part three, you finished very strongly.

407
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,890
And then the test,

408
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,950
don't be afraid to keep
going in part three

409
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,920
or you should keep going apart three

410
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,950
because people often feel tired

411
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,630
and they just want it to be over

412
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,670
so they get very short
answers for part three.

413
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:55,110
Often people do that subconsciously

414
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,090
as well cause they're just
like, "Oh, I'm sick of this."

415
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,950
But you did a really
good job on development.

416
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,030
Development is the most
important thing I think.

417
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,880
Apart from the four marking criteria,

418
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,550
development in part three
is the most important thing

419
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,960
and you did a good job
with that so, well done.

420
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,280
Let's talk about four marking criteria.

421
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,200
Your strongest area is pronunciation.

422
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,550
Like many Romanian students,

423
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,320
the clarity of what you're
saying is very good.

424
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,180
I can understand 100%
of what you're saying,

425
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,443
any ILT examiner would
be able to understand

426
00:21:30,443 --> 00:21:32,300
a 100% of what you're saying.

427
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,790
So that means that you would be getting

428
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,240
at least a band seven for pronunciation.

429
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,070
Plus you have very good use of intonation,

430
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,520
sentence stress, word
stress, connected speech,

431
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,070
all these higher level
pronunciation features,

432
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,960
you've very good command of those.

433
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,650
Which means you would get more than

434
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,200
a seven for pronunciation.

435
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,990
So when you combine the examiner
can understand everything.

436
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,820
Plus you're using those higher
level pronunciation features.

437
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,300
So that's probably why you
got a band eight the last time

438
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,780
because you can't get a
band eight without using

439
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,873
the higher level pronunciation features.

440
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,160
For fluency and coherence,

441
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,410
your coherence is very
good because you answered

442
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,900
every question properly.

443
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:19,550
You stuck to the answering the question

444
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,340
rather than going off topic

445
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,700
and you fully developed your question.

446
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,870
So for part one, you don't
need to give very long answers.

447
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,880
You gave a few answers
that were quite short

448
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,870
at the beginning, but the rest were fine.

449
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,280
At part two, you talked for two minutes,

450
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,113
so that was fine.

451
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:36,580
And part of three, you
fully developed your answers

452
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,840
by answering the question,
explaining, giving examples.

453
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,580
So that was good to see.

454
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,880
Fluency was very good in part one.

455
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,610
Quite good and part three,

456
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,980
dropped a little bit in part two.

457
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,380
But we've already talked about that,

458
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,287
how to get around that.

459
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,773
And I would encourage you,

460
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,539
don't be complacent about speaking

461
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,372
(murmurs)

462
00:22:58,372 --> 00:23:00,850
practice part two, because
part two seems to be

463
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,580
the area that you need to. 

464
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,397
The only area that you
really need to worry about--

465
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,170
- It depends on the subjects so maybe

466
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:11,480
I should do more subjects
with various teams.

467
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,313
- Yeah.

468
00:23:12,313 --> 00:23:15,623
- And have an answer about and some ideas.

469
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:21,131
- A pint of sweat is better
than a drop of tears.

470
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:26,131
So you wanna do the hard work
and during your preparation

471
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,020
make it as difficult as possible.

472
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,850
So the test day is a breeze

473
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,433
and it's no big deal for you.

474
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,330
So that would be my only concern.

475
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,530
Your fluency is very
good and it's at least

476
00:23:41,417 --> 00:23:42,650
at a band seven level.

477
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,530
But as I said before, if you
got a topic that you know

478
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,220
nothing about and they're
gonna ask you about

479
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,770
the same topic in general in part three

480
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,560
so it's like, you said before you got

481
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,640
they're asking you about history

482
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,130
and you don't know anything about history

483
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,830
or you don't know very
little about history.

484
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,890
So that could cause
fluency problems because

485
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:08,860
you don't have a problem
with the language,

486
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,540
but you might have a
problem with the content

487
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,380
you're tryna think of of those things.

488
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,630
But in general it's very rare.

489
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,040
I don't think you would ever get a topic

490
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,750
that you know nothing about.

491
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,886
Like history is something that
you know a little bit about.

492
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:26,262
You know of what the World War I was

493
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:27,095
and or the World War II.

494
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,250
They're not testing your
knowledge of the World War II

495
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,580
or the World War I,

496
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,720
they're talking about
whether you can talk about

497
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,740
a range of topics.

498
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,200
And your vocabulary is quite good.

499
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,840
You have a really nice
range of vocabulary.

500
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,820
I asked you about many different topics.

501
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,150
You have no problem talking
about all of those topics.

502
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,150
So that. 

503
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,510
Because I was asking
about a range of topics

504
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:55,870
and you have topics
specific vocabulary related

505
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,190
to all of those and
that would indicate that

506
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:01,720
you have a very wide ranging vocabulary

507
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,640
because if you asked
someone about five or six

508
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,010
different topics and
they have topics specific

509
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,900
vocabulary about all of those,

510
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,590
that means that you could talk about

511
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,780
pretty much any general topic.

512
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,150
So that was very good.

513
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,423
Collocations are something
that work on for you.

514
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,970
When you're listening to
English and reading English,

515
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,550
notice collocations underline them,

516
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,400
put them in a book and work

517
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:29,363
trying practice them,
review them and use them.

518
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,260
Collocations is one of the
areas that tells an examiner

519
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,240
the difference between
somebody at a band six,

520
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,960
band seven level and a band
eight, band nine level.

521
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,330
Cause if you listen to
native English speakers

522
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,360
they will use collocations
just intuitively

523
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,120
without even thinking about it.

524
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,760
Whereas someone at a band
six, band seven level

525
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,980
will know the words.

526
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,770
They might have a very
wide ranging vocabulary

527
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:59,400
but they might not be able
to put those words together

528
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,460
which would make little
mistakes with that.

529
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,580
I'm not too worried about
your vocabulary though.

530
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,500
Just be careful with
collocations but in the test

531
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,007
don't be thinking
'collocations, collocations'

532
00:26:12,007 --> 00:26:12,840
(laughs)

533
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,323
cause that will affect your fluency.

534
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,560
Cause there's a balance between

535
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,380
fluency and vocabulary and grammar.

536
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,040
The more you think about
vocabulary and grammar

537
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,783
normally the lower your fluency.

538
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:29,610
Just be confident that that
I think your vocabulary

539
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,540
is good enough to get
a band seven at least.

540
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,010
And the one area that I
would be concerned about

541
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,730
is small grammatical errors and
you seem to have two things.

542
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,610
One would be, you seem to
be translating sometimes.

543
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,430
So that's probably because of the way

544
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,410
I would guess that you learned English

545
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,810
through translation rather than learning

546
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,213
it through communication.

547
00:26:56,231 --> 00:27:00,030
The other problem is
little fossilized errors.

548
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,384
Fossilized errors or errors that you make

549
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:06,090
and you've no idea that
you are making them.

550
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,840
So common fossilized errors or things like

551
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,640
articles and prepositions,
they don't affect.

552
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,400
You didn't make article
mistakes by the way,

553
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,533
but you made some preposition mistakes.

554
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,720
They don't affect communication.

555
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,600
So if you're in Dublin and you're in a bar

556
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,500
and you're talking to your boyfriend,

557
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,087
he won't correct you if you
say, 'of' instead of 'in.'

558
00:27:33,388 --> 00:27:35,340
It was a preposition cause
he understands exactly

559
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,290
what you're saying.

560
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,040
So that means that you never pick up

561
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,640
on the mistake that you're making

562
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,420
and you make it again and again and again

563
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,420
and again and it becomes
hardwired natural into your brain.

564
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,910
A good way of of getting around
that is to record yourself

565
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,760
and listen to it.

566
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,870
So I think the best advice
that I could give you

567
00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,063
would be get part two questions.

568
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,600
Look at them, prepare them for one minute,

569
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,830
record on your phone and then listen back.

570
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,960
Because that's gonna help your fluency.

571
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,330
It's gonna help part two,

572
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,870
but it will also help you
pick up on these little

573
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,030
grammatical errors that you're making.

574
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:19,150
You're not making any
serious grammatical errors

575
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,760
and you're not making them
like every single sentence

576
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,240
because if you were, there's
no way that you would have

577
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,870
got to band seven and a band eight

578
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,660
the last two times that you did it.

579
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,520
And I'm not really concerned
that you'll get a band six

580
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,843
or a band 6.5, but we wanna
make absolutely 100% sure.

581
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:39,070
These little errors that
you're making with grammar

582
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:42,660
are also present in your writing.

583
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,900
So I think working on them is gonna help

584
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,410
both your speaking and your writing.

585
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,763
So we wanna make your preparation
as efficient as possible.

586
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,590
So I think doing that in
combination with the reading

587
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,080
and the listening and the
writing that we suggested

588
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,520
for you is gonna really help you.

589
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,130
Any questions about the speaking test

590
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,683
or any question about the
advice that I gave you?

591
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:08,100
- Not now but I will think about it.

592
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,140
- I think you should be really confident.

593
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,890
And if you take those steps,

594
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,607
I think you'll get at least a band seven

595
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:20,560
and if not, repeat the band
eight that you got last time.

596
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,393
So well done.

597
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,336
- That's good to hear.

598
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:24,424
- Alright, good.

599
00:29:24,424 --> 00:29:27,674
(bright upbeat music)
