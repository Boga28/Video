Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.  

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,520
Are you ready to think and speak in 
English about your daily life? Let's do it.  

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,640
If you watch a lot of American movies or TV shows, 
you probably have noticed that people ask a lot,  

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,920
"Hey hun, how is your day?" Or, "What did you 
learn in school today?" But have you ever asked  

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,560
these questions to yourself? If not, that changes 
today, because you are going to be learning  

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,520
23 common daily expressions to talk about your 
daily life. I'm going to be going through my  

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,800
daily routine, helping you learn some common 
phrases that might also apply to your daily  

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,920
routine. And to help you never forget what you 
are about to learn today, I have created a free  

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,280
PDF worksheet for today's lesson, with all of 
the vocabulary, all of the sample sentences,  

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,080
and all of the ideas so that you never forget 
them. And you can use them yourself. You

00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,720
can click on the link in description to 
download this free PDF worksheet today. 

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,920
All right, let's get started with the beginning 
of the day and a phrase that you can use in  

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,040
your daily life too. If I'm lucky, first 
thing in the morning, I'll hear my alarm,  

14
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:21,440
maybe push snooze and get up slowly. But if I'm 
not lucky, I'll hear one of my children screaming,  

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:30,480
"Mommy." And I have to get out of bed first thing. 
I used this expression first thing two times. The  

16
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,720
first time was at the beginning of a phrase. First 
thing in the morning. Make sure that you don't add  

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:45,360
first of the things, or first of the.  It's 
only first thing. First thing in the morning,  

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,160
I hear my alarm, or we could use it at the end of 
a phrase like you just heard me say. I might say I  

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,280
wake up and make coffee first thing. I make coffee 
first thing. Actually for me, I don't make coffee. 

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,520
I don't even know if I know how to make coffee. 
I always make tea. I am quite an amateur. Maybe  

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,200
say newbie or maybe clueless when it comes to 
coffee. My husband Dan likes coffee, but I could  

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,880
say I wake up and make tea first thing, beautiful 
phrase. Let's go to the next part of my morning.  

23
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,280
After I'm awake, I head to the kitchen and 
start to make some breakfast. Sometimes my  

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,200
kids and I read a book or play a little game 
at breakfast because not everyone in our house  

25
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,960
is a morning person. Sometimes at least one of 
us will wake up on the wrong side of the bed.  

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,680
So having a little bit of fun lightens the 
mood and helps you to start your day off right. 

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,280
Do you know what a morning person is? A 
morning person is someone who wakes up happy,  

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,720
ready to start at the day. Are you a morning 
person? Or maybe you wake up on the wrong side  

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,400
of the bed. This is a little bit metaphorical. 
There's not really a good side of the bed and a  

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,440
bad side of the bed, but it means that you wake up 
grumpy, maybe a little cranky, maybe not so happy.  

31
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,640
You could say, "Ugh, I woke up on the wrong side 
of the bed today. I need some coffee." Or tea,  

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:16,400
if you're me. Then after breakfast, I drop my 
son Theo off at preschool. This phrase verb  

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,440
to drop off can be used for people or for 
things. So you heard me use it for people. 

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:30,160
I drop my son Theo off at school, or we could 
put it together. I drop off my son at preschool,  

35
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:37,600
but we could also drop something off. I dropped 
my computer off at the repair shop. Make sure  

36
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,600
that you don't forget the word off, because if you 
just say I dropped my computer at the repair shop,  

37
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,840
it means your computer fell on the ground, 
broke. Luckily you're at the repair shop,  

38
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,480
but it means something really different 
than to drop off. So make sure that you  

39
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,360
say I dropped off my computer at the repair shop 
or I dropped my computer off at the repair shop. 

40
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,040
Then I come home to start my work day. 
Usually I catch up on some emails. I go over  

41
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,920
any lessons that I'm going to have for my 
students. And sometimes I just call a friend  

42
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,720
to catch up. This phrasal verb to catch up or to 
catch up on is often used in daily life. And you  

43
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
can probably use it in our life too. Let's take 
a look at some situations. Let's imagine you've  

44
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,160
had a super busy week and it's the weekend and 
you look around and your house is a disaster.  

45
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,960
Right now, my couch is covered in blankets. This 
table has papers and everything all over it. 

46
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,080
Oh boy, I need to catch up on chores. I need to 
catch up on some cleaning that I didn't do during  

47
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,600
the week. Can you guess what this means? There's 
something that you've delayed doing. Maybe you  

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,040
don't want to, or you don't have time, and now 
it's time to do it. So I could say, I need to  

49
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,600
catch up on some emails or I need to catch up on 
some cleaning, but I also used this to talk about  

50
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,400
my friend. I call my friend to catch up. Well, 
it kind of has the same idea. I haven't talked  

51
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,400
to my friend for a while and now we're talking 
about everything that's happened since we last  

52
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,280
talked. So if you see someone, maybe you're in the 
grocery store and you run across someone who you  

53
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,240
haven't seen for a while, you might say, "Hey, 
you want to go get some coffee and catch up?" 

54
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,120
That means I haven't you for a while. I want 
to hear everything that's been happening. Let's  

55
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:32,000
catch up. I also said in my little story that 
I go over some lessons, and this is a simply a  

56
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,360
really common way to say review. You can use this 
in the workplace a lot. You might ask someone to  

57
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,360
help you out. You could say, "Hey, could you go 
over this email before I send it?" Maybe you're  

58
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,000
writing a really important email and you want to 
make sure you have everything right? You could ask  

59
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,920
a coworker, "Hey, when you have a second, could 
you go over this email before I send it? I would  

60
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,000
really appreciate it." That's so polite. And also 
if the other person is a kind person, they might  

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,080
feel kind of good about themselves. Like, oh, 
you think my opinion and my ideas are important  

62
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,120
and worthwhile? Sure. I'll go over that email 
for you. I will give it my stamp of approval. 

63
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,760
When I finish my work, I pick up my son from 
preschool and we head home. This verb to head  

64
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,920
somewhere is used all the time. Let me give you a 
couple situations. You might say like I just did,  

65
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:29,040
I'm heading home. That means you're going in 
the direction of home. You're not there yet.  

66
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,520
You're not stopped, but that's where you're going. 
I'm heading home. Or if someone calls you and  

67
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,120
says, "What are you doing?" You could say, "I'm 
headed to the store. I'm headed to the store."  

68
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,400
In American English, the store usually means 
the grocery store or the supermarket. You're  

69
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,240
going to go buy some food. I'm headed to the 
store. Or if you are ready to go and everyone  

70
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,440
else is just taking their good old time, you 
can say, "All right, it's time to head out."  

71
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,080
This phrase to head out means out of the house.
Come on. It's time to head out. Let's go.  

72
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,480
A great way to use to head out. When we get home, 
sometimes my son and I have a little tea party  

73
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,600
together and chat about his day. Usually as we're 
eating and drinking, he kind of opens up about his  

74
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,600
day. And if he doesn't open up what we're eating, 
sometimes I ask some specific questions. Like  

75
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,760
how many holes did you dig today? Did you 
jump in the leaf pile? He goes to an outdoor  

76
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,760
nature school. So they play outside all day, all 
weather, any season. They're pretty tough. They  

77
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,440
have lots of good warm clothes, but asking these 
types of specific questions can him to kind of  

78
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,440
review his day in an easier way. You might hear 
people in movies and TV shows using the phrase,  

79
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,360
tell me about your day or what did you do today 
or what did you learn in school today, even worse. 

80
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,200
These types of broad questions, 
usually we don't really like to answer,  

81
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:03,440
especially at the end of the day, you feel 
like you just want to detox, decompress.  

82
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,280
And it's tough to summarize your day in just a 
few words like that. So maybe when you were a kid,  

83
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,000
if your mom asked you, "What do you learn in 
school today?" You probably said, oh, nothing  

84
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,600
because it's just too hard to 
summarize your day. So if you have  

85
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,640
a significant other, if you have kids, if 
you're just asking someone about their day,  

86
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,800
I recommend, first of all, doing something 
together, spending some quality time together. You  

87
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,840
don't have to have a tea party. Although, I highly 
recommend it. Very fun. All you need is some tea,  

88
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,840
maybe a little snack, cut up an apple, have 
some nuts or dried fruit, whatever you like.  

89
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,440
And just spending quality time 
together can help someone to open up. 

90
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,520
This is a phrase we're going to use in 
just a minute. I want to tell you about it,  

91
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,080
but I recommend if someone doesn't open up, asking 
specific questions. This helps someone to recall  

92
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,120
the information that happened to them during 
the day. Especially with kids this is helpful  

93
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,160
because they're just living their life. They're 
not thinking about summarizing at the end of the  

94
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,320
day. So when you ask a specific question, 
oh, what game did you play at recess today?  

95
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,160
Oh, did you eat anyone else's food at lunch 
today? These specific questions can help your  

96
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,160
child to open up. And this phrasal verb to open 
up is beautiful. I love this concept. When you're  

97
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,000
talking with someone, usually at the beginning, 
there's kind of a wall. You don't immediately  

98
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,480
share your deepest thoughts. If someone says, 
"Hey, Vanessa, how are you doing today?" 

99
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,640
No matter how I'm really feeling, I'll always say, 
"Oh, pretty good. What about you?" Because I'm  

100
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,240
not ready to open up. In those types of passing 
situations, we're just not comfortable sharing  

101
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:53,520
our inner thoughts. So when you spend quality time 
together, that wall kind of drifts away a little  

102
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:59,280
more and someone might be more willing to be 
vulnerable. And that's the idea when you open up,  

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,440
that means that you are willing 
to talk about your struggles,  

104
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,160
something difficult in your life. Something really 
meaningful in your life, not just the surface,  

105
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,520
shallow things. But when you really open up 
to someone, you're being your authentic self.  

106
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,440
So just remember these Vanessa tips, the next 
time that you want someone to open up to you. 

107
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
All right, let's go to the next part 
of my day. When the weather's nice,  

108
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,080
usually our neighbors come over and hang out. 
Sometimes we have snacks. Sometimes we play games.  

109
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,760
Sometimes we just chat. But because my backyard 
is very sunny, it's a favorite hangout spot.  

110
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,320
And this word, to hangout can be used in two 
different ways. It can be used as a verb.  

111
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,680
We love to hang out in the backyard. This means 
to casually spend time. Usually with other people,  

112
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,440
we hangout together. Or it can be used as a noun. 
This is a hangout. Or as an adjective. So I guess  

113
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,280
we can use this in three ways, a hangout spot. 
So it's describing this location. What kind of  

114
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,000
location is it? It's a hangout spot. It's not 
a professional place. It's not a private place.  

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,360
Instead, it's a hangout spot. It's where we just 
go to spend time with other people. After hanging  

116
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,200
out with friends, as the sun starts to go down, 
usually we come inside and start to cook dinner. 

117
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,800
While we're eating dinner, we try to sit down at 
the table as a family. It's nice to try to have  

118
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,840
a little bit of quality time together. So 
we like to ask each other some questions,  

119
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,320
the most common questions. In fact, my four 
year old son Theo loves to ask these to us.  

120
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,520
He asks us one by one. "What was the best part 
of your day?" And when everyone has answered,  

121
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,480
he asks, "What was the most challenging part 
of your day?" And it's so funny the things  

122
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,640
that kids will say to these questions. 
So if you haven't done this in your home,  

123
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,240
if your kids aren't familiar with English, 
it's okay. You can ask in your native language,  

124
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,560
but asking these questions helps to kind of prompt 
conversation a bit. And when you're opening up  

125
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,600
about the best thing or the most challenging 
thing about your day, it kind of encourages the  

126
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,560
other people at the table to open up to. Oh, what 
a great phrasal verb that we just learned about. 

127
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,200
There are two phrases that I want to share 
with you that I just mentioned. One of them is  

128
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,760
as a family. Now this just means the group, the 
whole group, the family group, but we can use  

129
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,760
the same structure in other ways. We could say 
as a family, as a neighborhood, as a community,  

130
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,600
as a department, as an office. So it's talking 
about all the people that are in that group. So  

131
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:41,280
for example, you could say it's important to spend 
some time together as a couple without your kids.  

132
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,520
So if you have kids, spending time without them, 
it's very important. So you could say as a couple,  

133
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,040
just you and your significant other. It's 
important to be together without your kids  

134
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,680
occasionally. Another expression that I used is 
quality time. I already mentioned this when I  

135
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,680
was talking about the tea party. I think I might 
have mentioned it. If not, having a tea party is  

136
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,680
good quality time too, but it means that you are 
not just having a shallow experience together. 

137
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,880
It's not rushed. You don't have to go anywhere. 
You're just enjoying each other's presence.  

138
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:19,280
So I really encourage you to try to spend some 
quality time with someone this week. It means that  

139
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:25,600
you don't need to go anywhere. You don't have any 
kind of schedule. You have a full hour just to  

140
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,320
take a walk with a friend or to chat on 
the phone or to play a game with your  

141
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,680
kids. Something that's quality time. There's 
no agenda. You're just enjoying being together.  

142
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,320
After dinner, we clean up. We put the kids to 
bed. We tuck them in and tell them sleep tight.  

143
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,840
So one of these expressions that I used, you have 
to be very careful about. I said, "We put the kids  

144
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,520
to bed." This means that we help them sleep. So 
maybe we brush their teeth. We read some books.  

145
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:02,000
We sing some songs and we help them to relax.
When you say we put the kids to bed, that's  

146
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,800
what it means. But you have to be very careful 
because if you change the word bed for sleep,  

147
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,560
if you put someone to sleep, it's very different. 
Usually this is a pet. So if we say I had to put  

148
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:23,680
my dog to sleep last week, it means you had 
to euthanize, which is a nice way to say, kill  

149
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,440
your dog. Maybe that means he was really old. He 
was suffering. It's a really tough thing to do,  

150
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,520
but it's often necessary. So make sure that 
you do not say I had to put my kids to sleep.  

151
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,880
Instead, I had to put my kids to bed. Much 
better. Of course, if you say your kids,  

152
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,720
people are probably going to understand 
that you mean you helped them sleep,  

153
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,960
but just to make certain that 
you're using the best expression,  

154
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:59,200
you can say I put my kids to bed every night 
at 7:00. I put my kids to bed. Beautiful. 

155
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,880
The final thing that I say to my kids 
before they go to bed is sleep tight.  

156
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,160
What? Tight? This is a fun expression that's 
actually shortened from another full expression.  

157
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,480
It is goodnight, sleep tight. Don't let the bed 
bugs bite. Of course, we hope you don't have  

158
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,440
bugs in your bed. This is a very old expression. 
Sometimes we say that full expression, goodnight,  

159
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,680
sleep tight. Sometimes we say, goodnight, 
sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite.  

160
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,920
But oftentimes we just shorten that to goodnight, 
sleep tight, or just sleep tight. And it just  

161
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,880
means I hope you sleep well. So if you hear 
people say this in English movies or TV shows,  

162
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,000
or if you want to say this yourself, it's great. A 
very natural thing to say at the end of the night. 

163
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,600
After the kids are in bed, Dan, my 
husband and I have some precious downtime.  

164
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,760
Sometimes we get caught up on chores. Maybe 
get caught up on a book that we're reading.  

165
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,280
Sometimes just chat about our day and decompress.  

166
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,680
This is a great expression, downtime. It 
means you have nothing else to do except  

167
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:13,360
decompress and relax. It's essential to have 
downtime, especially before you go to bed.  

168
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,120
If you are looking at Instagram while you're in 
your bed, oh no, no, no. Stop that right away.  

169
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:27,200
It's very bad for your sleep. You need to have 
some downtime. Give yourself a one hour pause  

170
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:33,040
before you go to bed to try to slow your mind 
down. Having some downtime with someone you or  

171
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,400
just by yourself. Relaxing is essential. When the 
day's over, it's finally time to hit the hay. If  

172
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,440
I've had a really busy day, I might just sleep 
like a log. But if I'm feeling a bit stressed or  

173
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,880
there's a lot going on in my mind, I might toss 
and turn a bit before finally falling asleep. 

174
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,840
And fingers crossed that my children sleep 
all night, so I don't have to wake up in the  

175
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,040
middle of the night to help them. And that's my 
day. Let's talk about some of those expressions  

176
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,760
I just used to hit. To hit the hay does 
not mean that I'm a farmer and I have a  

177
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,240
last minute chore at the end of 
the day, I need to hit the hay.  

178
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:14,240
No, instead it just means sleep. I need 
to hit the hay. My hay needs to go on the  

179
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,000
pillow. Ugh. I need to hit the hay. And I 
also said that I might sleep like a log. 

180
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:28,880
Does a log move? Does a log make any sounds? 
Nope. It's just a tree that fell over and there  

181
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:36,960
it is. Nice and silent and still. It means you 
slept very soundly, very quietly and peacefully,  

182
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,440
but to toss and turn on the other hand, toss and 
turn means that you did not sleep peacefully,  

183
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,680
or at least you didn't go to bed peacefully. 
Your body and your mind is too active. You  

184
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,680
tossed and turned. And what about the last one I 
used? Fingers crossed. This is just a fun way to  

185
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:00,240
say I hope that my kids sleep all night. Fingers 
crossed that my kids sleep all nights, and me too. 

186
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,920
So I want to know is your day similar to mine.

187
