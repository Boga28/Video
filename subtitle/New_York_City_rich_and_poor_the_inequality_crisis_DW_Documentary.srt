1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,000
America is voting on its future —
the wealthiest New Yorkers too.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,240
To me, we have fix the pandemic,
so we can fix the economy.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,400
The gap between rich and poor is
wide, and it's getting wider.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
New York City was hit
hardest by the pandemic.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,200
And the poorest - worst affected.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,120
If Trump is re-elected,
nothing will improve for us,

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,440
it will only get worse.

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,240
The coronavirus crisis put the
focus on social injustice —

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,680
right in the middle
of an election year.

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,840
Only one of the two candidates admits
the existence of systemic racism.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,200
We need someone who can bring
together and unify the country!

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,240
Eight months, one city, three worlds
- the city's upper, middle and lower

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,400
classes. This film shows an
idealized city, traumatized,

14
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,239
while taking a look behind New
York's glittering facades....

15
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,280
and lays bare one of America's
biggest failings - inequality.

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,160
Spring 2020 and actor Kevin Smith
Kirkwood takes a walk on Broadway.

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,760
Theaters are closed. He and his
colleagues are out of work.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It’s very intense. And
it’s scary not knowing

19
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,720
when there is an end in sight.

20
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,800
There are some pretty dark days, you
know. Because that fear set in.

21
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,400
Our business is already filled with
insecurities and times of insecurity.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,400
But to have no idea...

23
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,560
of anything on the horizon?

24
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,240
New York confirmed its first
coronavirus case on March first.

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Two weeks later, the city
started going into lockdown.

26
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,360
By the end of the month, the US city
became an epicentre of the pandemic.

27
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:35,280
Sirens break the silence in a
city usually pulsing with life.

28
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,440
New York's world-famous theater
district Broadway closed quickly.

29
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,400
In a normal year, it would
attract millions of visitors.

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,360
It's where Kevin had fulfilled
his lifelong ambition to

31
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,760
become an actor and singer.

32
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,320
An ambition he achieved
despite the odds.

33
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,400
The little black gay kid from
the ghetto of Toledo, Ohio.

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,800
Who saw his dream come true. I
spent six years in this building.

35
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,200
Winning the Tony Award. Performing at
the Tonys. Winning the Grammy Award.

36
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,600
His breakthrough came with the
award-winning musical '’Kinky Boots’',

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,600
which saw Kevin also
dress up as a woman.

38
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,200
He was finally on the verge of
his own directorial debut —

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,680
at a small theater
outside New York.

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,760
I was just starting to feel like
I had a footing in the industry,

41
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,200
you know. And then this happened.

42
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,960
A few blocks away from Broadway...
Tiffany's on fifth avenue,

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,280
that's where Emerita Ramoon
works - or did, until March.

44
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,760
So, my job was to package any
retail items that came downstairs.

45
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,280
If a customer called or order
online, it will come downstairs,

46
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,240
I would check it, examine it, wrap
it up and package it for shipping.

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,560
Her personal take on the world
is a very different one.

48
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,200
Emerita lives in a highrise in South
Bronx, New York's poorest borough.

49
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,959
Tiffany gift boxes remain empty.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,840
Emerita pays 1300 dollars
for a two-room apartment...

51
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,840
a rent that was manageable
while she still had a job.

52
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,360
Emerita's parents came to New York as
Latin American immigrants... and ended

53
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,640
up somewhere that couldn't be further
from the affluent centre of Manhattan.

54
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,400
As a little girl, my mom will watch
all these old movies and one of her

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,040
favorites was Breakfast at Tiffany's.

56
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,360
I understand why, you know, walking
in front of this store was like a big

57
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,800
thing for Audrey Hepburn, you know,
you want to lavish lifestyle.

58
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,640
So, as a young female living in New
York. That's what I always embodied

59
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,160
for myself. And I made my breakfast
at Tiffany's dream come to pass.

60
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,360
Now the dream is over - Emerita no
longer has her job. She's had to send

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,840
her children to stay with other family
members, because money's so short.

62
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,680
The Bickley family has gone to stay in
their summer house in the Hamptons,

63
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,320
two hours' drive from their
Manhattan apartment.

64
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,040
The daughters are fashion influencers,
and can work from anywhere.

65
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,160
Just a fun fact about my closets —

66
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,760
I work with a girl who is
a professional organizer.

67
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,400
She arrived in the
Hamptons before I did...

68
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,360
and organized by color and category.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,200
Father Ian became a multimillionaire
at the luxury goods brand Coach.

70
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,000
Today he's an independent director
for the shoe company Crocs,

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,960
and a board member of the
cosmetics firm Natura.

72
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,680
Success is the intersection of hard
work and good luck. Good fortune.

73
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,440
And I really do believe that.

74
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,320
Mother Kim manages her two daughters,
Sophie, 28, and Charlotte who's 26.

75
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:32,000
You know, they are sisters. I just try
to keep everyone focused and calm.

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,520
Sophie and I like to refer to
ourselves as bloggers, influencers.

77
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,480
I prefer influencers and
content creators. - Yeah.

78
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,440
What we do, from a job point of view —

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,680
We like to look at ourselves as
people who are recommending things

80
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,240
to like to influence
people in a positive way.

81
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,560
For them, influencers are
more in demand than ever.

82
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,160
For some, quarantine outfits
are the "in" thing.

83
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,800
It’s such a cute outfit?

84
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
People are bored at home, shopping
online, a lot of sales going on?

85
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,920
They're on Instagram all day because
they don’t have anything else to do.

86
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,000
We were really pushing for
the wearing of masks.

87
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,400
People definitely are
judging about it.

88
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
Because people are losing their
job and things like that.

89
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,800
?and we’re focusing on clothes.

90
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,160
But it’s our job. Some people
don’t really understand.

91
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,920
- But we’re sensitive about it.
- Yeah, we try to be.

92
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,880
The metropolis of extremes
— and the pandemic.

93
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,720
By April, New York is experiencing
days that will deeply

94
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,680
scar the city's collective memory.

95
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,600
Under lockdown, anyone who
can stay at home, does so.

96
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,080
As many as 800 people a day are
dying in the city's hospitals.

97
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,400
Bodies are stored in refrigerator
trucks behind the clinics.

98
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,360
Why was the city so badly affected
- and who was it affecting worst?

99
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,640
There were two groups. Those who could
leave the city or work from home.

100
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,959
And those who continued to
work to keep the system going,

101
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,600
for those who were able
to flee to the Hamptons.

102
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,560
Although this divide existed in the
city long before the pandemic,

103
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,720
it has now become a
matter of life and death.

104
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,040
New York - with its 8.4 million
inhabitants, five boroughs,

105
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,640
all divided into
unequal neighborhoods.

106
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
There are parts of Manhattan
where almost everyone is white.

107
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,760
But that’s not the case in the Bronx,
people of color are the majority.

108
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,480
In New York, there's a correlation
between skin colour and income.

109
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,120
Residents in poorer parts of the Bronx
and Queens are mostly Black or Latino.

110
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,080
And it's here that most New Yorkers
are dying of the coronavirus.

111
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,960
Health is a luxury not
everyone can afford.

112
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,200
25 out of 30 zip codes were in
white, wealthier neighborhoods.

113
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,760
and those hit the most were in poorer,
Black and immigrant communities.

114
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,160
They weren't getting tested.

115
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,000
Coinciding with the end of
lockdown, anger spills over.

116
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,680
The death of George Floyd in
Minneapolis on May 25th sparks days

117
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,200
of protests, after he's shown
suffocating with a white

118
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,120
police officer kneeling on his neck.

119
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,800
There are protests in New York
and throughout the country.

120
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,640
Unrest and looting overshadow peaceful
protests for social injustice.

121
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,640
The mood is further inflamed by police
brutality directed at anyone...

122
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,480
Black or white.

123
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,040
When you combine the Covid virus
with the virus of racist cops,

124
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,720
you're going to have an explosion.
And that's what you are witnessing

125
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,720
Those are the folks in the
street who are getting sick.

126
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,160
yet it is also those who are being
targeted by the police unfairly.

127
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,240
The protests go on for months.

128
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,400
For Emerita Ramoon, racism is an
all too familiar part of life.

129
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm not a color. You're not a color.
You're a human being.

130
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,920
And that's how you should carry
yourself. But once you put a title on

131
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,560
yourself, it changed everything.
And I think that's the problem

132
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,400
with people in today's society.

133
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,480
She knows the chance of catching
COVID-19 in this district

134
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,760
is much higher than in Manhattan.

135
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,560
As you can see in this neighborhood,
it's not a lot of funds.

136
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,960
So, a lot of people don't have
insurance to go. And if they are sick,

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,960
they don't want to go to an emergency
room because they don't have the pay.

138
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,480
So in neighborhoods like this, you're
going to get hit very hard when stuff

139
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,680
like that happened, cause it's
a poor neighborhood, poverty.

140
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,800
Within a kilometer radius of Emerita's
house in the South Bronx 10% of

141
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,120
residents define themselves as white.
The average annual household income is

142
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,040
just shy of 27000 dollars. Almost half
the residents here live in poverty

143
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,120
or are at risk of poverty. Before the
pandemic, 13 percent were unemployed.

144
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,720
In May, the area was among those
with the highest number of cases.

145
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,320
I did hear some tenants did
have it and some passed.

146
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,560
It's June, and Emerita
hardly leaves her apartment.

147
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,320
She's waiting and hoping for
a job, and to see her sons.

148
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,360
One of them is spending the lockdown
with his father, the other son is with

149
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,080
Emerita's mother. Emerita herself
couldn’t afford to feed them all.

150
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:37,560
It’s about to be, what, three months?
Three months without seeing my kids.

151
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,520
Physically, I see them do video talk
it. But physically touching them,

152
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,480
physically hugging, you
know, three months.

153
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,000
What’s up guys? I'm
getting my nails done?

154
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,520
The Bickley family were able to
remain together during the pandemic.

155
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,480
They have paid help. Mexican nail
designer Alicia is on a house visit.

156
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,360
I have four kids — and I’m
afraid for my kids especially.

157
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,680
- So why do you do it?

158
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,600
I need money. My husband and I
we stayed home for 2 months.

159
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,440
Now we start work a little bit.

160
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,920
Alicia earns 150 dollars an hour.

161
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,640
She's prepared to take the health risk
in order to earn that kind of money.

162
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,520
For the Bickley family, work
doesn't entail a health risk.

163
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,840
We’re extremely fortunate to have the
choice of being here versus in New

164
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,240
York City when things are like this.
Not everybody has a choice.

165
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,040
The city is one of the most inundated
places with the virus right now and

166
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,400
also we're so fortunate to have
like a backyard to go out on.

167
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,640
And a lot of people are just
stuck in their apartments.

168
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,920
The virus reaches the
Hamptons in April...

169
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,280
but arrives more slowly
than in New York city.

170
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,840
Within a kilometre radius
around the Bickley's home —

171
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,200
90 percent of residents
define themselves as white.

172
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,480
Around 2.6% live close
to or below the poverty line.

173
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,360
And pre-pandemic unemployment
levels were under 2%.

174
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,600
At the peak of the crisis, seven
times more people were dying

175
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,760
in New York than in the Hamptons.

176
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,000
So how do society's more privileged
members deal with social injustice

177
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,560
during a deadly pandemic? Is it okay
to carry on showing off one's wealth?

178
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,080
I’m sensitive about what the girls
post on their Instagram all the time.

179
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,200
- Really?

180
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,120
I’m like — “why?”- you know,
some? but that my opinion.

181
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,920
It’s their brand and they should
do what they want to do with their

182
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,920
Instagram you know? It’s not for me to
say or to control. It’s their brand.

183
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,080
People just don’t
like? I mean people?

184
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,240
If it was my brand I wouldn’t do
what they do. But that’s not?

185
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,680
Dad, what are you talking about?

186
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:23,520
I’m not Yin to my Yang! No no no? I’m
just saying — your brand is about you

187
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,800
guys, your lifestyle, you know that’s
what it is, that’s what I think is

188
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,960
magnetic about it and what attracts
people. And I’m just saying —

189
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,920
it’s not my brand or lifestyle
or what I would choose to post

190
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,280
if I were? You’ve seen my Instagram.

191
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,440
People are different. I have my own
brand and my own? - Okay, we got it.

192
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:52,120
Kevin lives for performing - but
now his life is in intermission.

193
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,280
An actor and singer without any
earnings, and perhaps more importantly

194
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,440
- without a stage.
Although, not exactly....

195
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,800
For Kevin, church has taken
the place of the theater.

196
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,920
It's a window on the world, even
if the audience is only virtual.

197
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,320
The first few were like, oh, this is
kind of weird. This is kind of kooky.

198
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,200
And then I got used to it as best
as I could. It's just it's not as

199
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,800
fulfilling, you know, to be able to
look into people's faces and hear

200
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,720
them singing along with you and
standing up and clapping and waving

201
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,040
their hands. It's a much different
experience. So, it's been a challenge

202
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,120
for me to try to keep my
performative energy up.

203
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,480
Speaking candidly as a pastor, I'm
like, maybe I shouldn't preach.

204
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,440
Maybe we should just sing the
whole time because it's so,

205
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,400
you know, spirit filling,
you know, and so uplifting.

206
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,640
People have lost mothers and
fathers and sisters and brothers.

207
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,560
People are suffering. They feel
lonely, they feel isolated.

208
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,200
They've lost loved ones. So there's
kind of a very it was a heavy,

209
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,440
heavy mood and it was difficult
pastoring in that context.

210
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,960
Religion is an anchor for
Kevin, especially now.

211
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,880
Like for so many others,
enforced isolation is tough.

212
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,360
Being able to come here and still
getting to worship, you know,

213
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,040
getting to sit and listen to the
pastors, you know, sermon like first

214
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,920
hand and be in the space, you
know, has been amazing for my

215
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,840
anxiety levels and
my stress levels.

216
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,400
After church, back in Queens...
Kevin's neighborhood Astoria.

217
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,840
This neighborhood is fun and eclectic
and ethnically mixed and diverse.

218
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:13,200
It's a great shopping area
and shopping district. Great

219
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,680
Middle-Class Neighborhood,
lots of families,

220
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,640
lots of young people,
young transplants.

221
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,920
In the one kilometer area around
Kevin's apartment, 74% of residents

222
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:34,080
define themselves as white. The
average household income is around 74

223
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,080
thousand dollars. Eleven percent live
around or below the poverty line.

224
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,280
Before the pandemic around
five percent were unemployed.

225
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,280
The number of coronavirus cases
here in April was around 40%

226
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,120
below the New York city average.

227
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,200
I felt very safe, actually, during the
pandemic. I felt like this is a good

228
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,160
neighborhood to sort of weather the
storm and sort of and I felt a little

229
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:10,000
bit protected. I felt lucky that we
were not at the center of infection.

230
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:17,880
But economically, the
slowdown has been harrowing.

231
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,920
Emerita Ramoon doesn't feel
at all safe in the Bronx.

232
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,280
But now she's got something
to look forward to.

233
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,200
Her youngest son Eissac is
coming home in four days' time.

234
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,960
The 13 year-old has just finished
his school year, online.

235
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,240
Yes. You made it to eight grade.

236
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,840
You should be proud of yourself,
regardless of the circumstances put

237
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,480
in at the short period of time. And
you didn’t it lose focus of anything.

238
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,920
You fell behind a little bit, which
was able to, you know, catch up.

239
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,880
And I told you, it's not how you
start, it's how you finish it.

240
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,720
So, you finish strong and give
yourself a round of applause.

241
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,720
Eissac has been living
with his grandmother.

242
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,360
I'm very excited for him to come home.
I love smelling my kids.

243
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,800
I just love smelling, you know, just
sniffing they hair sniffing their neck

244
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,800
because it's something about
a kid's smell, you know?

245
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,840
And it just takes me back to
when there was a baby, like, oh,

246
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,840
my goodness, I remember your smell.

247
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:26,520
It's June and after almost 3 months
of total lockdown, New York cautiously

248
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:30,200
begins to open up again. Some
businesses, like hairdressers,

249
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,080
are allowed to reopen -
under certain conditions.

250
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,040
At the same time, the effect the
pandemic has had on New York is

251
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,360
becoming clear. Unemployment has
risen to above 20%, almost the level

252
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,320
it was at the time of
the Great Depression.

253
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,960
Our research shows that in May one
million New Yorkers were suddenly left

254
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,240
without work. The number of people
who could no longer afford to feed

255
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,040
themselves doubled to two million.
A crisis already existed —

256
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,400
the coronavirus exacerbated it.

257
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:10,600
Anyone who can afford to do so,
has already left the city.

258
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,840
By early May, almost a quarter of New
York's uptown apartments are empty.

259
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,680
This country is very wealthy. The
reason that we can't meet the needs of

260
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,120
our poor fellow citizens is not that
we do not have money. It is because we

261
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:37,520
have had years of tax cuts, loopholes
and lax prosecution of tax fraud.

262
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,880
There are people who are getting
richer and richer in this pandemic.

263
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,640
And we do not dare to ask them to do
their civic duty and pay their fair

264
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:56,760
share. But we have to do
this to save our budget.

265
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,560
It's July the first, not far
from the Bickley residence.

266
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,920
The poor of New York protest at
the gates of the city’s rich.

267
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,000
Legislation has passed to cut welfare
spending using the savings to

268
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,240
plug the massive fiscal hole left
by the coronavirus pandemic.

269
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,520
The protesters are demanding that
instead of punishing the poor,

270
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,280
the city should tax its billionaires.

271
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,960
The rich can continue
to live their lives —

272
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,880
while we have to queue up in
endless lines - for a meal.

273
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:37,000
The protest doesn't make it as far
as the Bickley family's house.

274
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,240
Ian would be prepared to pay higher
taxes... he tries to play his part.

275
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,680
He's become a mentor to people
like James, his former intern,

276
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,000
who's just finished college.

277
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,280
I came into 2020, excited. For me, as
I’m looking at my job situation now.

278
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,080
It’s challenging.

279
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:07,160
This is what I try to also
say to myself every day.

280
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,680
You know, I think this
is a moment in time.

281
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Yes, that’s it, I want to do something
I'm passionate and excited about.

282
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,440
For Sophie, the everyday life of an
influencer doesn't stop because of the

283
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:32,840
coronavirus. In Southampton, shopping
is allowed again - with a mask.

284
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,000
In this bastion of the ultra-rich,
there's barely a sign of the

285
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,480
catastrophe ravaging other
parts of the country.

286
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,960
It's an idyllic seaside place.
Ocean is just over there.

287
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
If you’re in New York City, you go
to the Hamptons. That's what it is.

288
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,760
So any equivalent of like a town in
Germany, that’s the Hamptons for us.

289
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,040
The next day back in the Bronx,
Emerita sees her son Eissac for the

290
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:21,440
first time in three months.
Her brother brings him home.

291
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,800
I'm really excited, the last
time I saw my baby was in March.

292
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,880
He's healthy, he's big and just
looks great. He even grew!

293
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,800
Mother and son are hoping that
life can get back to normal.

294
00:24:49,840 --> 00:25:00,040
He is home Mommy! He
looks good, he is tall.

295
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,960
It feels better than my home.
I like it, I like it here.

296
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,640
I feel safer. It feels
much larger too.

297
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,760
Today, nothing's going to spoil their
mood. But for Emerita, more financial

298
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,000
hardship is already
looming on the horizon.

299
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,720
Kevin is putting on a performance
- in his own front-room.

300
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,160
It's part of a theatre project that
combines monologues and dance,

301
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,600
documenting New Yorkers'
experiences of the pandemic.

302
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,840
The director gives instructions via
conference call. Kevin's role - a

303
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,040
choreographer who feels totally
blown off-course by the lockdown.

304
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,800
As an artist I have I connected with
being lost at the beginning of Covid

305
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,880
not knowing where my art and
inspiration was going to come from.

306
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,960
To take this art and use it to
help work through our fear,

307
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,800
my own feelings, it
was really awesome.

308
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:17,680
And that's that's one of the beautiful
things about what actors get to do.

309
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,720
Dance might help Kevin process the
experiences of the past few months.

310
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,920
But - it won't earn him much money.

311
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,080
You’re such a great dancer, I’ve
never seen you dance like this.

312
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,160
In addition to unemployment benefits,
Kevin gets around 600 dollars a week

313
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,800
coronavirus subsidy. But now
that scheme is to be wound down.

314
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,920
I'm optimistic. I am positive. I
don't think they're going to be able

315
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,840
to justify cutting that six
hundred dollars totally.

316
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,720
I think so many Americans would fall
off, literally fall off a financial

317
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,960
cliff. I wouldn't be homeless. But
with the six hundred and the base,

318
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,840
you know, I am able to
pay my bills, you know.

319
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,360
But that's exactly what happens. It's
August and in New York, case numbers

320
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,320
have fallen significantly. Even the
Rockefeller Center is open again.

321
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,640
Kevin has to dig into his savings,
because there are no more subsidies.

322
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,200
Ian Bickley is back in the city —

323
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,240
he shows us his apartment on
Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side.

324
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:44,720
We have these little rails for our
dogs who love to destroy things.

325
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,240
They've hardly used the apartment.
Luxury space left empty - while many

326
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,360
New Yorkers don't know how they'll
be able to pay next month's rent.

327
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,880
Someone like me and look at our
family and look at the life that we

328
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:07,320
have and that we lead. We haven't been
so affected by Covid, certainly from

329
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,640
an economic standpoint. Because of the
opportunities that we have and the

330
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:17,840
flexibility we have, we have options.
But a lot of people don’t.

331
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,600
Emerita Ramoon can't afford her rent -
and now she's paying in installments.

332
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,720
She's been saved by a food bank
in the apartment block basement.

333
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,400
Canned foods and pasta to get her and
son Eissac through the difficult time.

334
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,640
Emerita is in freefall - but there's
no social welfare net to catch her —

335
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:45,800
and she's not the only one.

336
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,560
Of those entitled
to unemployment benefits, only 70% are

337
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:59,720
granted it. Among African-Americans
it is only about 55%.

338
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:06,560
The reason - overburdened bureaucracy,
and one that makes many mistakes.

339
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,200
Emerita stays strong for her son
- gardening is her therapy.

340
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,960
So how am I supposed to tell my
son at night when I tuck him in?

341
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,520
You can be whatever you want to. This
too shall pass. God is a good God.

342
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,280
And then I’m in the living room. The
bill’s being doubtful. Can’t do that.

343
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,520
Evening on the Upper East Side. Ian's
having dinner with his mentee, James.

344
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,360
It's the first time they've met
in person for a long time.

345
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,800
James has great news.

346
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,880
I got a job, working at a real
estate company, based in New York,

347
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,200
a small developer, a lot of great
people, and they were able to offer me

348
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,520
a fulltime opportunity,
despite everything going on.

349
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:01,320
Looking towards the future, things are
definitely less certain than eight

350
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,880
months ago, but when
everyone does their part,

351
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,680
everyone will be in a better
place than eight months ago.

352
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,880
I still do think it’s
a moment in time.

353
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,080
However, I, I at the same time feel
like the crisis is much deeper and

354
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,040
worse than I did several months ago.
A lot more people are unemployed.

355
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,720
That means there’s a lot less spending
that affects other businesses.

356
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,080
So, it becomes a
vicious circle.

357
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:35,760
In the Bronx, the mood is grows tense.
Emerita is holed up in her apartment

358
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,040
with Eissac. Since the start of the
summer the number of shootings kept

359
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,720
rising. In August, it was more
than double the number in 2019.

360
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,080
It’s only eight a clock at night
and all of this is happening?

361
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:55,360
Sometimes, partying can descend into a
shootout in just a blink of an eye.

362
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,360
After a while you get used to it. The
guns start sounding like firework,

363
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,880
you can’t tell the difference.
Until you wake up the next morning

364
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:07,160
and you hear — oh, there
was a shootout last night.

365
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,840
With all the things that we just came
out of, it’s not getting better.

366
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,760
It’s getting reckless.

367
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,840
The shooting, it could
happen near you.

368
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,880
And then if you witness it and if
they see you, you’ve got to run.

369
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,520
For Kevin, things start
looking up in September.

370
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,280
Everything he thought he had lost
has suddenly become possible again.

371
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,880
In New Hampshire, the first
theater is opening up again.

372
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,000
And he's directing the production.

373
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,240
I’m very excited. I’ve been inspired
over the past week because this

374
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,520
transpired within the past week and a
half or two. So, you know, solidified

375
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:00,720
over the past week. I’ve just been so
inspired coming up with choreography

376
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,880
and ideas, talking about costumes and
lighting, dancing in my kitchen.

377
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,720
The theater is nearly six hundred
kilometres away, but at least Kevin

378
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,560
gets to make his directorial debut.
Now it needs to get off the ground.

379
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,400
I wanted to do it immediately.
I jumped at the chance.

380
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,440
It’s very important to be able
to start that engine again.

381
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,520
And so I’m honored to be a part of it,
to be a part of starting the movement

382
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,520
towards making live
theater happen again.

383
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,640
It's mid-September, and it’s
Fashion Week in New York.

384
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,480
Summer's over and Charlotte and
Sophie are back from the Hamptons.

385
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,600
They're getting made up.

386
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,760
Sophie and I serve as editors of a
magazine, The Daily Front Row, which

387
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,960
is featured in the Hamptons
in New York City and L.A.

388
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,760
And today we’re going to start
our day off with a lunch.

389
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:16,040
It's one of a few live events - most
of fashion week is happening online.

390
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,560
One really fun part about Fashion
Week is getting all glammed

391
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,400
up because otherwise I don’t
wear any makeup really.

392
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,240
And so that’s always really fun.

393
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,160
If it is a normal fashion week, it’s
literally from morning to night,

394
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,040
about four days to five days before
shows. So then I’m a little nervous

395
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,640
because they will get on each other’s
nerves and they will have fights.

396
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,400
And so I have to have
a mental breakdown.

397
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,000
I have to be there to
pick up the pieces.

398
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,240
But this particular fashion week in
Covid is so far going to be relaxed.

399
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,520
Their father, Ian is on
his way to Central Park.

400
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,280
I want them both to have perspective.

401
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:05,600
I think in any situation, to be the
best that you can be, you have to have

402
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,239
perspective and understanding for
the situation that you’re in.

403
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,079
The benefits that you have, the
opportunities that you have and not to

404
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:21,920
take those for granted. You used the
word privilege. You know, do they

405
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,400
really understand the
privileges that they have?

406
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,840
And, you know, could they be
doing more with that, I think.

407
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,480
We don’t feel privileged. We’re
lucky to be in our position.

408
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,240
But we have to wrap. Yeah.

409
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,800
Whitefield, New Hampshire. The town
of 2200 has hardly any COVID cases.

410
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,640
Kevin Smith Kirkwood is getting
ready for the premiere.

411
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,480
It’s amazing to be up here. Because I
already love the place and because I

412
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:10,080
think it’s safer, I was Instantly able
to just sort of exhale a little bit.

413
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,760
The theater is one of the first in
the whole country to open up again.

414
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,760
Kevin has had to quarantine and get
tested - like everyone on his team.

415
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,800
We were rehearsing in their rehearsal
room in masks and trying to sing and

416
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,320
dance this show in a mask. Not easy.
But we did what was necessary.

417
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,760
So we did have to make some
concessions artistically.

418
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,000
We couldn‘t let Audrey
and Seymour kiss.

419
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,920
The day is here - theater-goers are
only allowed in to see the performance

420
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,320
under safety measures. TV teams
aren't allowed in under new rules.

421
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,000
Kevin's done it —

422
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,280
he's restored a little bit of
normality in the midst of a pandemic.

423
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,520
We‘re successful. Everybody‘s healthy.
Things are clean. Theater’s sanitized.

424
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,760
And people came tonight and sat
and watched and laughed together.

425
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,200
It‘s amazing.

426
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,960
It's October, and the city is getting
back on its feet. Six months ago,

427
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,400
this was the centre of the pandemic.
New Yorkers are still traumatized.

428
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,360
Anyone without a mask is viewed
as anti-social. Masks are only taken

429
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,680
off to eat at the newly-established
curbside restaurants.

430
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,600
They're allowed to fill a
quarter of inside seating —

431
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,960
but few people take the opportunity.

432
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,400
The number of people applying for
unemployment benefit has dropped again

433
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,720
sharply, but it's still eight
times what it was in 2019.

434
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,840
Empty offices across the city has
meant many smaller businesses reliant

435
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:07,200
on office workers have had to close.
New York is facing a massive tax

436
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:11,600
deficit, with no end in sight. And
despite all the health precautions

437
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,240
some districts are seeing a rise
in coronavirus cases again.

438
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,480
People line up for food in every part
of town. Without a job, savings are

439
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,120
spent on rent, and it's the poorest
who are left struggling to survive.

440
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,000
For many it's a worse 9-11, previously
the worst catastrophe to hit New York.

441
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,360
9/11 targeted particular
parts of the city,

442
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,240
but didn't shut down the whole
economy nor go on this long.

443
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:53,080
There was emphasis on
returning to normalcy.

444
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,560
Obviously, this pandemic isn't over.

445
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:00,440
Eissac and Emerita Ramoon still
feel trapped in their apartment.

446
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,600
Emerita doesn't want him to go back to
school, in case he catches the virus.

447
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,720
Homeschooling is possible thanks to an
iPad from school, and an old computer.

448
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,400
I really don’t like being inside,
mostly I am distracted by games or

449
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,080
watching a show. If I don’t play
games or watching a show I just sit

450
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,080
on my bed and do nothing.
It gets lonely. A lot.

451
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,640
Emerita hasn't found a new
job, and she's broke.

452
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,080
Soon she won't be able to
afford this apartment.

453
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,040
I'm not receiving anything because
of the pandemic agreement that the

454
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,600
government is doing is on pause.
But my faith is still strong.

455
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:58,080
I'm smiling and taking one day at a
time instead of planning out my life.

456
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,160
You can't plan any more. You
just have to go with the days.

457
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:07,920
Her ambition is to finally
get out of the Bronx.

458
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,080
The Bickleys are meeting for dinner.

459
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,720
It's not long til the presidential
election. It's a topic they prefer

460
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,320
to avoid discussing with
some of their friends.

461
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,880
We don’t talk about politics.
Haha.

462
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,520
There are a lot of closet republicans.

463
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,880
The effects of the pandemic have
made the Bickleys reflect...

464
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,680
Sophie has her doubts now about
the world of influencers.

465
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,800
It makes me wanna go where I can go
tutor kids that can’t be tutored or

466
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,680
don’t have laptops or don’t have
parents who can help educate them.

467
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,320
It makes me want do really do more.

468
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,800
I think the gap between the poor, the
rich and certainly even the middle,

469
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,280
the middle is a huge margin, but it
has become too large and people are

470
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,000
suffering. That's what I think the
president has to really work on.

471
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,600
The pandemic has has exacerbated it,
in my opinion, and brought it even

472
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,360
more to light, but the underlying
issues were there before.

473
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,160
Popcorn for the televised
debate between Biden and Trump.

474
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,560
Kevin is concerned about the election
and the future of his country.

475
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:54,640
I am one of the people whose lives
will be affected directly by the

476
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,600
choices that are made in our country.
I don't have a (expletive) cushion.

477
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,800
I'm an artist.

478
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:11,000
No trust fund family. Artist.
Black, queer.

479
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,520
These kinds of decisions
affect me seriously.

480
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,720
Despite the crisis, Kevin Smith
Kirkwood has achieved his big debut.

481
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,680
But Broadway remains closed for now.

482
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,960
Financially, Emerita Ramoon is at
rock-bottom, but remains optimistic.

483
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,600
The Bickley family gained a new
perspective on the city, and life.

484
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:46,440
Three lives, three worlds, one city.
The contrast existed long before the

485
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,800
pandemic, but the coronavirus
has amplified it,

486
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:55,280
and cemented the gaping division in
society. Not just in New York, exposed

487
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,200
as the metropolis of inequality,
but also across the whole country.

488
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,640
A challenge facing the United
States - and its new president.
