1
00:00:01,969 --> 00:00:06,442
I'm having a hard time reading
on the train right now.

2
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:10,070
Unh. Hold on. I'll
start the lesson.

3
00:00:12,298 --> 00:00:16,573
Hi. James from engVid.
Sorry, I was on the train.

4
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:18,810
I want to teach you
a lesson about

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:26,449
four basic prepositions that we use in English
that sometimes get confused, and I understand

6
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,549
why, so I'll keep it basic. But because it's
basic, it's going to be 80% correct. That's

7
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,440
a good thing, that means you can go to the
website and learn more from other lessons

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,270
we have. But just know that sometimes there'll
be exceptions, and I may not cover it here

9
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:45,994
today. I'll even give you two exceptions
to help you, but why waste time?

10
00:00:46,019 --> 00:00:47,905
Let's go to the board.

11
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:53,808
Here's Mr. E. You'll notice he has
a calendar, he has a clock, and:

12
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,679
"You are here"?

13
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:57,453
Oh, here.

14
00:00:57,478 --> 00:01:02,295
"Here" is a location. We're here right now,
doing a lesson. That's the location: engVid.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,348
Let's go to the board and do the
rest of the lesson, shall we?

16
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,373
Here's: "at", "on",
"in", and "by".

17
00:01:10,842 --> 00:01:14,380
"At". I love it because
it's very specific, so you

18
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:21,250
always know where you are, exactly. Problem: For
transportation, "at" doesn't have anything.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:27,142
Hmm. So let's go to the next one.
Let's go to "on". On.

20
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:29,260
"On" is used for, let's say,

21
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:38,430
large vehicles or large ways of travelling,
such as buses... Sorry. Trains, buses, planes,

22
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,560
and boats. I'll come back to boat in a second;
it's an exception. On the train, on the bus,

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,310
and on the plane, unless you're Bill Gates,
Donald Trump, or me-I'm not in that list-you

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,830
don't have your own train, plane, or bus, so
you usually share it with a bunch of people

25
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,803
or a few people. It's large.
So we say:

26
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:04,131
"You're on the bus", because
it covers a big area,

27
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:09,963
so there are many people sitting in that area.
When I get to location, you'll see what I mean.

28
00:02:10,487 --> 00:02:14,980
Boat is a small exception. For many people in
the world, they have their own boats because

29
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,709
maybe they do fishing, or rowing, which is
a type of boat that you go by yourself. In

30
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:25,903
that situation, you can use "in". So,
if the boat is small enough, say: "in":

31
00:02:25,928 --> 00:02:32,110
"I'm in a boat right now." But if it's a big boat,
you have to say: "I'm on a boat." Another exception

32
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:40,560
for the "on" rule is bicycle. You're always
"on" a bicycle. I know, I said big vehicles,

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,220
but remember: a bicycle is small, and it doesn't
really have a motor or an engine, so we kind

34
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,110
of give it its own thing, because you have to
sit on the bicycle, and you can never really

35
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,730
be in a bicycle. Is that good?

36
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:59,903
Now, let's go to "in". "In" is funny because
there are only two things for "in".

37
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,761
"In" we use for car and taxi.

38
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:08,663
The easy way to think about it
is usually you own your own car;

39
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:13,239
it doesn't belong to a group of people. People
just don't get on your car every time you

40
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,529
stop it, they go in and
say: "Take me somewhere."

41
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:19,890
And a taxi, well, when
you're in a taxi, it

42
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:25,010
is kind of your car. You pay the driver and
you keep the car. So, this is one of those

43
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:31,670
few cases where, because it belongs to me, I
am in my car or I am in the taxi, because

44
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:36,680
the taxi belongs to me as long as I pay the
money. It's one of these funny exceptions.

45
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,819
I don't know why, because you can put more
people in a car, but I guess because you can

46
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,930
actually own this transportation, it's yours.
Think of it like the small boat. The small

47
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,800
boat, one person is in it, you can
be inside of it. All right? Cool.

48
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:56,650
The last one we're going to do is "by". This
is how you get there. So, "by" is different.

49
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,381
When we talk about "in" and "on", you are... We
are talking about how you are in the vehicle.

50
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:08,283
Are you sitting on the bicycle? I can see you
on it? You know, a boat is on water. But

51
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:13,920
"by" just means: How did you get here? So,
when someone responds to you with: "By car",

52
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,459
"by plane", they're telling you how they got
here. Not if they're in the plane, or on the

53
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,525
plane. They are just... That's how they got
there. So, how did I get here to do this video?

54
00:04:25,853 --> 00:04:32,699
Wouldn't you like to know. I'm kidding. I
came here by car. So, yes, I was in my car

55
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,690
and drove here, but I would tell somebody:
"I got here by car, not by bus", and that

56
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,500
would tell them the difference in the transportation
I took. "How did you get here?" You like that?

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,400
Good, so that's "by", this is how you did
it; and the way you travelled is here, "in"

58
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,250
and "on". Remember there is a small exception
for small vehicles, so a small boat you can

59
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,520
be in. Remember small. And a bicycle, you're
always on the bicycle, because people see

60
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,754
you sitting on it. We good? Excellent. Now,
that is the lesson for transportation.

61
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:12,173
Let's look at location. You'll notice
that the same rules or ideas apply.

62
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:18,489
Remember I said I liked "at" because it's
specific? Notice the dot, it's very specific.

63
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:22,963
"Meet me at my house." That
does not mean down the street,

64
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,571
that does not mean in another city.
It means:

65
00:05:25,596 --> 00:05:31,366
My house, you. Meet me at my house, specific
location. Or I'll give you an address:

66
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:34,261
"Meet me at 51 Eglington."

67
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:38,731
Not: "In 51 Eglington", no.
"At", that means right there.

68
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:43,386
You can see the number and the place.
Like it? I do, too.

69
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:50,815
"On". If you notice, this is a dot, and this
is like a carpet or an area. This is why I

70
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:56,345
said on the bus, the train, and the plane -
they are big, they have an area. And because

71
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,024
of that, we say "on" because you stand in
an area.

72
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:05,468
So, "on". We put things on a table.

73
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:13,539
Imagine... Nope. How about this? This is a better
table. I'm going to put something on the table. You

74
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:18,450
can see it on, and here is an area.
Cool? That's for "on".

75
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,680
"In" I can use the same thing. That's the
next one. "In", there is a surface, but you

76
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,693
have to go over and in something. Remember I
said "on" here? This is now "in". You can't

77
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:37,569
see it anymore, can you? Because it's inside
with a bunch of markers. It's inside. But

78
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:47,870
when it's on the surface, you'll notice "on", you
can see it. "In", like magic, it disappears.

79
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:53,640
Okay? So, "in", usually you have walls or
something surrounding you that you can look

80
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,110
up and see the walls. You'll see there's the
board here, and there are three other walls,

81
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:03,890
so I'm in a room. But I'm on the floor because
I'm standing on the floor. Okay? So if the

82
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,969
floor was here, this would be me. Ta-da. But
I would go in the room, and now you need a

83
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,659
door to see me. Okay?
So, "in" and "on".

84
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:23,119
"By". Many of you know "close" and "near". So,
if you think of two things... Okay? Here's

85
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:26,381
one thing, here's two things.
We can say:

86
00:07:26,406 --> 00:07:29,185
"This is by the red marker."

87
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:33,710
Similar to saying "close" or "near".
We just say "by".

88
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:37,020
There's 8% of this marker.
I said 80% lesson, but

89
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,030
it seems it's gone down. [Laughs] Well, "by" is
similar to "close" or "near". And you notice

90
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,360
the arrows, here, show you, if I say I'm close
to your house or by your house, it's similar

91
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,968
to saying "by" or "near".
Okay? Cool.

92
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:57,480
Now I'm going to deal with time. When we deal
with time, we'll start at "at". "At". Remember

93
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,574
I said very specific, that's why I like it?
This is when you say things like: "At 9:15",

94
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:07,945
"At 12:00". It says very specific time
when we deal with hour and minute.

95
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:16,010
-"What time will I meet you?" -"At 10:30." Specific.
That doesn't mean 12:00. That's not "at". Okay?

96
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:23,239
Day... Sorry. "On". When we talk about "on",
we talk about days. "On Monday", "On Tuesday".

97
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:31,729
And if you're confused, think of it this way: A
day has 24 hours. It's kind of got a surface

98
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:37,130
to it. It's not just one specific time; it's
got a little bit of time on it. So, on that

99
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:42,120
day-okay?-anything can happen on that day
on the surface. We stand on it, and we walk

100
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,779
across it. You wake up, then you go to sleep.
So, on that day. Funny enough, you can say

101
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:54,029
things like: "On Christmas day", "On Monday",
"On my birthday". So if you have a word that

102
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:59,389
has a day in it, you can use "on". Told you
I'd make it easy. It's 80% true, there'll

103
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:04,289
be exceptions. I know, someone will say one.
But just think: "Did I say 'day' in there?

104
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,677
'On' the holiday." Right? You can say it,
because it's got "day". Make it easy.

105
00:09:08,732 --> 00:09:13,454
Okay, now we've talked about
specific time with "at",

106
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:17,568
and on the day with "on",
but let's look at "in".

107
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:23,380
When I say something like: "In September",
what I'm talking about are long

108
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:30,659
periods of time. We can say that for years,
months, and weeks. So, for instance, I can

109
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,041
even go back in the past and say:
"In 1992, I came to Canada."

110
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:38,173
Or: "In September,
I will buy a hat."

111
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:43,339
Now, we're talking about specific time,
as we did in "on" and "at", but this

112
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,062
time we're talking about longer periods
of time, and we're being very specific.

113
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:55,190
Now, I'm going to go to one more for you and
we're going to go by "by". "By" is fantastic

114
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,393
because it's the end of a specific time.
If I say: "I need it done by tonight",

115
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,293
that is the time, it's specific, and
that's the end time or your limit.

116
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:09,862
And funny enough, that's the end
of my lesson. I'm at the limit.

117
00:10:09,887 --> 00:10:12,299
I hope you've enjoyed it.
E has been helpful,

118
00:10:12,324 --> 00:10:16,162
bringing out the calendar and the
clock, and giving us a location.

119
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,852
Quick recap: You can use
"at", "on", "in", and "by"

120
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:24,339
for transportation,
location, and time.

121
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:28,864
When we deal with transportation, there are a
couple of exceptions you want to remember.

122
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:35,620
"On" is used for large groups of people travelling
by train, bus, plane, or boat. But sometimes

123
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:41,717
a boat can be for one person, and you can
say "in". We also use bicycle for "on", and

124
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:47,432
that's because you sit on the bicycle. When we
talk about "in", we use it for car and taxi,

125
00:10:47,457 --> 00:10:52,156
because that's usually your private
vehicle. Even though you say taxi's public,

126
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:58,510
when you're in it, it's yours as long as
you pay for it, and it's also small. Okay?

127
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:02,619
"By" is how you get there;
by car, plane, or train.

128
00:11:02,822 --> 00:11:07,810
When we went for location, we talked about
specific with "at". On the surface or in an

129
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:15,139
area for "on", like a carpet, think like carpet.
"In", think like a box, you go in a box. And

130
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:19,451
"by" is similar to "close" or "near"
or "close to" when you used it.

131
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:25,516
And finally, for time, we talked about
specific time-okay?-using these prepositions.

132
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:31,849
"At" is one time only; "on" is for
days: "On Monday", "On Christmas day";

133
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:37,602
"in" is used for longer periods of time, like:
"In September", or we can go back into the past:

134
00:11:37,627 --> 00:11:39,731
"In 1992";

135
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:46,206
and finally, end time when we use "by".
Okay? And we say that's the end.

136
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,695
And that's the end of
this particular lesson.

137
00:11:48,797 --> 00:11:52,944
So, I'd like to thank you, once
again, for coming to engVid.

138
00:11:52,969 --> 00:12:02,132
And what did I say? I need you to go
to www.eng as in engVid... English.

139
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:03,948
