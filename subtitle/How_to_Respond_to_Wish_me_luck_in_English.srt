00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,610
Hello, if you're watching
this English lesson on Tuesday,

2
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,010
September seventh,

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,680
there's a good chance that
as you're watching this,

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,970
I'm in my classroom,
teaching my first classes

5
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,300
of the school year.

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,360
As many of you know,

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,210
I'm a high school teacher
here in Ontario, Canada,

8
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,910
and Tuesday, September
seventh is the first day

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,940
back at school.

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,520
So, wish me luck.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,891
Wish me luck is a phrase we say to people

12
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:27,670
before we do something new
or difficult or stressful.

13
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,010
It's a phrase we say because
we want people to respond

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,409
in a nice, positive way.

15
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:36,320
So wish me luck, but you
might not know how to respond.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,320
So in this video, I'm going to
show you five different ways

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,070
to respond when an English
speaker says to you,

18
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:42,903
wish me luck.

19
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,730
Well, hello and welcome
to this English lesson

20
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,410
where I'm going to show
you five ways to respond

21
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,670
to the English phrase, wish me luck.

22
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,760
Before we get started though,

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,430
if this is your first time here,

24
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,890
don't forget to click that red
subscribe button over there

25
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,590
and give me a thumbs up if
this video helps you learn

26
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,129
just a little bit more English.

27
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,880
So, someone has said to you wish me luck,

28
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,420
the best way to respond

29
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,600
and probably the most
common way to respond

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,850
is to continue to use the word luck.

31
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,820
You can say good luck or best of luck.

32
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,960
Both of those phrases are
just great things to say,

33
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,080
maybe you have a friend

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,287
who's starting a brand new job
tomorrow and they say to you,

35
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:26,500
"I'm starting a brand new
job tomorrow, wish me luck."

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,290
You could totally respond
by saying good luck

37
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,820
or best of luck.

38
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,970
Both of those phrases
indicate that you hope this,

39
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,170
the beginning of their new
job goes really, really well

40
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,320
and that they enjoy it.

41
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,242
So either good luck or best of luck.

42
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:43,270
The second way that you can respond

43
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,930
to the English statement,
wish me luck is to say,

44
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,870
I hope it goes well.

45
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,680
Now you can also be
specific instead of saying,

46
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,300
I hope it goes well,

47
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,820
you can mention the thing

48
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,810
that the person's going to be doing.

49
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,510
Maybe you have a friend
who has a job interview.

50
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,120
You could say to them, if
they said, "wish me luck."

51
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,000
You could say, "Hey, I hope it goes well."

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,397
Or you could specifically mention
the job interview and say,

53
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:10,039
"I hope the job interview goes well."

54
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,600
So the second way that you
can respond to this statement

55
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,900
is to say, "I hope it goes well."

56
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,420
Or to specifically say
what you want to go well

57
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,500
for that person.

58
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,987
In my case, you could say,

59
00:02:20,987 --> 00:02:24,470
"I hope your first day
back at work goes well."

60
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,310
This third way of responding
is actually quite similar

61
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,570
to the second way.

62
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,480
You can specifically talk
about the thing the person

63
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,900
is going to be doing.

64
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,487
You could say things like this,

65
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:38,070
"I hope you have a good
first day back at work."

66
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:41,050
Let's imagine you have a
friend who's going on a trip

67
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,883
and they've said to you,

68
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:44,840
"well, I leave in a few
hours, wish me luck."

69
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,787
You could respond by saying to them,

70
00:02:46,787 --> 00:02:48,927
"I hope you have a good flight."

71
00:02:48,927 --> 00:02:50,967
"I hope you have a good trip."

72
00:02:50,967 --> 00:02:54,320
"I hope you have a good time
when you go on your trip."

73
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,500
All of those would be great responses

74
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,380
if they said, wish me luck.

75
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,610
So notice once again,

76
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,870
you're mentioning the specific
thing that they are doing.

77
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:05,460
So in my case, as I start work tomorrow,

78
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,467
if I said, "wish me luck," you could say,

79
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:11,210
"I hope you have a good first
day back at school, Bob."

80
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,670
And I would respond by saying, thank you.

81
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,485
A fourth way that you can
respond is to simply say,

82
00:03:16,485 --> 00:03:17,990
"all the best."

83
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,460
Maybe a friend of yours
or someone you know

84
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,087
is going back to university
and they say to you,

85
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:26,440
"Hey, I'm heading out for
university in a couple of days."

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,500
You could, and if they
said, "wish me luck."

87
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,290
You could respond by
saying, "all the best."

88
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,400
It's short. It's sweet.
It's a great response.

89
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,940
And it simply means that you hope

90
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:39,220
they have a really good time
when they're at university

91
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,470
or in other situations that
they just have a good time

92
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,480
whatever they're doing,

93
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,740
that they are successful
and enjoy themselves.

94
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,560
You can add to this phrase
a little bit if you want,

95
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,474
you could say, let's say a
friend of yours is taking a test.

96
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:56,290
You can say all the best
on your test tomorrow

97
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,480
or something like that.

98
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,070
But I like to use the phrase all the best.

99
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,720
It's short. It's sweet,

100
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,890
I think it communicates exactly
what I would want to say.

101
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:07,400
If someone said to me, wish me luck.

102
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,100
I think this would be my favorite
response, "all the best."

103
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,096
A fifth way to respond is
to simply tell the person

104
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:17,130
that you're sure that things will go well,

105
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,560
maybe you have a friend
who's going to play a game

106
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,392
later today.

107
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:22,167
Maybe they're on a football
team and you could say,

108
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,280
"I'm sure the game will go well",

109
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,200
if he was to say to you, wish me luck.

110
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,070
Maybe you have a friend
who is going to be taking

111
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,017
their driver's test and
you can say to them,

112
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:34,720
"Hey, I'm sure your test will go well."

113
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,270
So a fifth way to respond is
to simply assure the person

114
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,630
that you think everything
will go really, really well,

115
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,520
whatever it is that they're doing.

116
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,227
So again, if I said to you,

117
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:48,980
"Whoa, it's the first day
of school, wish me luck."

118
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,407
You could respond by saying,

119
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:52,617
"I'm sure you'll have a great day, Bob."

120
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:54,537
"I'm sure you'll do a good job."

121
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:58,080
"I'm sure the school day will be awesome."

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,440
And of course, lastly,

123
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,500
you can always combine a whole bunch

124
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,100
of these phrases together.

125
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,690
And in fact, English
speakers often do that.

126
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,820
If I was to say to you wish me luck,

127
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,487
you could respond by saying,

128
00:05:09,487 --> 00:05:12,137
"good luck, I hope you have a good day."

129
00:05:12,137 --> 00:05:14,097
"I hope your day goes well."

130
00:05:14,097 --> 00:05:17,817
"I'm sure you'll do a good
job teaching your classes."

131
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,087
"Best of luck."

132
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:19,937
"All the best."

133
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:22,190
"I'm sure it will be great."

134
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,830
So again, you don't have to combine

135
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,340
that many of them together,

136
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,870
but when you are responding
to that statement,

137
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,010
when someone says to you, wish me luck,

138
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,430
you can always say two
or three of the phrases

139
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,390
I've just taught you.

140
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,000
And I think people will be
very happy when you do that.

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,340
Well, thank you for watching
this little English lesson,

142
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,550
where I hope you learned
a few ways to respond

143
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,810
to the English phrase, wish me luck.

144
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,200
Thank you so much for watching.

145
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,670
