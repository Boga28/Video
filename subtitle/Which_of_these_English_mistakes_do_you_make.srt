00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:05,140
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,540
Do you make these common mistakes in English?

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,030
Let's talk about it.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:19,160
Have you ever felt afraid to make a mistake
when you're speaking in English?

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,640
What happens if you make a mistake?

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,560
Other people will say, "What?

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,600
What did you say?"

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,199
Maybe you will miss out on a friendship or
you won't seem professional at work and your

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,199
heart will start beating.

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,300
You might start sweating.

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,040
It's a terrible feeling.

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,970
I think that because of school we are all
brought up with the idea that mistakes should

13
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,840
be avoided at all costs.

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,730
Mistakes are terrible.

15
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,730
But do you know what?

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:49,010
The reality is, that when you learn anything
new, a language, when you're learning English,

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,780
mistakes are inevitable.

18
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,030
Inevitable is a wonderful word that means
unavoidable.

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:00,850
You will definitely make a mistake in English,
because you're an English learner.

20
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,290
And a little secret, I make mistakes in English
too.

21
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:09,920
So what I would like you to do, even though
we are talking about common mistakes today,

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,920
I would like you to take a deep breath with
me.

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,960
Because when you make a mistake in English,
this means that you are getting out of your

24
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,250
comfort zone.

25
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,680
This is excellent.

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,550
It means that you are learning and progressing,
and sometimes making a mistake is a great

27
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,120
way to learn.

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:38,390
So I hope that you will not fear making mistakes,
but instead you will feel confident that making

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,801
mistakes means that you are trying something
new that you've never done before, that you

30
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:46,400
are having courage to get outside your comfort
zone.

31
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,950
So, congratulations, you are doing something
challenging.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,310
You're learning something new and making mistakes
is part of that.

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,730
And to help you today, sometimes it's nice
to learn from other people's mistakes.

34
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:06,610
I would like to share with you 11 common mistakes
in English that my students often make.

35
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:11,780
These are some grammar mistakes, vocabulary
mistakes, pronunciation mistakes, and maybe

36
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,630
you make these mistakes too.

37
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,600
Of course, it's not the end of the world,
but you are here because you want to level

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
up your English.

39
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,670
So I hope that these mistakes and corrections
will help you.

40
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,310
To help you with this lesson as well, I have
created a free PDF worksheet.

41
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,490
In this worksheet, I will give you all of
the mistakes, the corrections, sample sentences,

42
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,860
some tips and ideas about how to avoid them,
and what happens if you accidentally make

43
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,930
those mistakes.

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,810
And also, at the end of the worksheet, you
will answer Vanessa's Challenge Question to

45
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,730
help you use what you have learned in this
lesson.

46
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,160
So don't forget to download the free PDF worksheet.

47
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,450
There is a link in the description just for
you.

48
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,480
It is my gift.

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,470
All right, let's go on to learn these 11 common
mistakes that I often hear my English students

50
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,470
make.

51
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,780
The first couple mistakes are grammar mistakes.

52
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,290
Then we'll talk about vocabulary mistakes,
and finally some common pronunciation mistakes.

53
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,490
And you know what?

54
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,780
If you make these mistakes, even after this
video, I want you to take a deep breath and

55
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,830
to realize that you are doing something amazing.

56
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,590
You are learning a new language.

57
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,770
You are getting outside of your comfort zone.

58
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,770
You're awesome.

59
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,770
All right.

60
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:26,110
Let's start by talking about some common grammar
mistakes.

61
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,830
Mistake number one, "I went there by bus."

62
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,170
"I went there by car."

63
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,180
"I went there by plane."

64
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,129
Okay, so grammatically in a textbook, they
would say this is okay.

65
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:38,129
But do you know what?

66
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,960
In daily conversation, we rarely use "by"
plus transportation.

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,490
I went there by car, by bus, by plane, by
taxi.

68
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,750
It feels a little bit like textbook English
or classroom English.

69
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,160
Instead, we're more likely to use the verb
"take".

70
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,570
"I took a bus."

71
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,269
"I took a train."

72
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:00,569
"I took a flight."

73
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,330
"I took the plane."

74
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:08,560
With driving, because you're the one who is
in control, we often just say drive.

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,180
I drove to my friend's house.

76
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,190
We drove to the beach.

77
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:16,920
That's in the past tense, to drive, drove.

78
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:21,829
But here, we're more likely to use a verb
instead of a by phrase.

79
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,559
So take a look at this sentence.

80
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:27,460
How can we change it to make it be a little
bit more natural?

81
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,110
"We're going to Canada by plane next week."

82
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,759
You see that phrase "by plane".

83
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,370
And now you know it's not so natural, how
can we change this up?

84
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,960
Well, we have two options.

85
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,169
We can use the verb "take".

86
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,999
"We are taking a flight to Canada."

87
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,960
Or you could just say, "We're flying to Canada."

88
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,349
It doesn't mean you're a bird and you are
actually flying.

89
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:55,759
This implies that you are going into the airplane.

90
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,810
So you could say, "We're taking a flight,"
or, "We're flying."

91
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,689
Both of these are great options and you can
see how we use the verb to describe the action

92
00:05:04,689 --> 00:05:06,289
instead of a "by" phrase.

93
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes, you will occasionally hear this, but
I want to empower you to use the most natural

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
phrase possible.

95
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,720
All right, let's go to our second grammar
mistake that is commonly made by English learners.

96
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,650
"I have 33 years."

97
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,780
Huh?

98
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,909
No.

99
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:27,490
When we're talking about age, we do not use
"have".

100
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:33,689
instead we can say, "I am 33 years old."

101
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:34,689
"I am."

102
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,620
We use a "be" verb to talk about age.

103
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,960
This is something that I commonly see in my
students who speak a romantic language like

104
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,369
Brazilian-Portuguese or Spanish or Italian
or French.

105
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:49,659
I often hear, "I have 60 years."

106
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,369
"I have 55 years."

107
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:55,259
But instead we can have a little switch and
just say "am".

108
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:58,319
"I am 66 years old."

109
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,999
"I am 40 years old."

110
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:01,999
Beautiful.

111
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:07,210
Common grammar mistake number three is, "We
were five people at the party."

112
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,060
Huh?

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,789
This sounds very clunky and confusing in English.

114
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,129
It's like there were five people in your head.

115
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,129
What?

116
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,960
We were five people.

117
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,909
It's very confusing in English.

118
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:28,499
So instead, it's much more natural, and in
fact, just better grammar to say, "There were

119
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:31,249
five people at the party."

120
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:35,539
Or you could say, "There were five of us at
the party."

121
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:40,190
If you want to include yourself, the word
"us" includes yourself.

122
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:45,999
So you could say, "There were five of us at
the party," or, "There were five people at

123
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:46,999
the party."

124
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:52,020
Both of those are excellent and they use the
word "there" instead of "we".

125
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,839
"We were five people."

126
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:54,839
No.

127
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:56,469
"There were five people."

128
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:57,469
Great.

129
00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:01,229
Grammar mistake number four is, "Don't be
scary."

130
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:02,229
Huh?

131
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:03,349
Is it Halloween?

132
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:05,629
Are you dressed up like a vampire?

133
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,240
Don't be scary there's children here.

134
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,849
No, this phrase means stop scaring people.

135
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,360
You're dressed up as something really scary.

136
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,789
Stop being scary.

137
00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:18,819
Don't be scary.

138
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:24,830
No, instead, a much more common phrase is,
"Don't be scared."

139
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:30,349
I find that when my English students want
to say, "Don't be scared," they accidentally

140
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,960
say, "Don't be scary," which has a very different
meaning.

141
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,069
You are dressed up as something scary for
Halloween.

142
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:42,240
So when you're trying to comfort someone or
soothe someone, you could say, "Don't be scared.

143
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,240
I know that speaking English can be a little
bit difficult and maybe you feel nervous,

144
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,720
but don't be scared.

145
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm nice.

146
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,810
I hope that you can speak with me and feel
comfortable.

147
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,849
Don't be scared."

148
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:58,599
Let's go onto some common vocabulary mistakes
that my English students make.

149
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:04,029
All of the words that I'm about to talk about
are real English words, but they often get

150
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:09,389
mixed up in conversations by English learners,
and you know what, sometimes English native

151
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:10,800
speakers too.

152
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,539
So let's start with the first common vocabulary
mistake.

153
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:17,110
Definitely, defiantly.

154
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,400
Hmm.

155
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,800
Take a look at this sentence.

156
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,909
"I definitely do not want to jump into the
cold water.

157
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,710
I definitely do not want to jump into the
cold water."

158
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,649
But take a look at this sentence.

159
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:37,450
"He defiantly jumped into the cold water when
I told him not to."

160
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,450
Hmm.

161
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,240
"He defiantly".

162
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,760
Look at the spelling difference between these
two words.

163
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,870
For myself, I've found that as I'm writing
sometimes I accidentally write the word defiantly.

164
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,270
What's this word mean?

165
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,200
This means that you're rebellious.

166
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,620
I told him not to jump into the cold water,
and do you know what he did?

167
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,930
He looked at me and said, "Hm," and he jumped
into the cold water anyway.

168
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,180
He did it defiantly.

169
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,390
He was being rebellious.

170
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,260
He defiantly jumped into the cold water even
though I told him not to.

171
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
Hm.

172
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,610
Now, I'm definitely upset.

173
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:20,500
So make sure that when you're using these
two words, whether it's spelling or speaking,

174
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,160
we use them in the correct way.

175
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,120
All right, let's go to our second vocabulary
mistake.

176
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,550
Dessert, desert.

177
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,550
Ooh.

178
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,770
"When I was walking across the desert, all
I could think about was eating some ice cream

179
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,550
for dessert."

180
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:41,020
First, let's take a quick look at the spelling
differences between these two words.

181
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:47,620
When we talk about dessert, something sweet
and tasty, ice cream, cake, cookies, there

182
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,760
are two Ss.

183
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,000
A good way to remember this is usually you
want more dessert.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,130
So we have two Ss.

185
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:04,170
And when we're talking about the hot, dry,
sandy place, desert, there's only one S. That's

186
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,200
the spelling differences, but let's talk about
the emphasis and the pronunciation differences.

187
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,480
"I want to eat some dessert.

188
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,310
I want to eat some desserts."

189
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,060
There is emphasis on the second syllable.

190
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,230
Can you say that with me?

191
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,500
I want to eat some dessert.

192
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Dessert.

193
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,830
But what if I decide to go on vacation to
visit that dry, sandy place?

194
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,680
We might say, "I'm going to the desert.

195
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,920
Desert."

196
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,670
There's emphasis at the beginning, de-, desert.

197
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,070
"I'm going to the desert.

198
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,070
Desert."

199
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,070
Wonderful.

200
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,740
So make sure that when you are spelling these
words, they're correct.

201
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,880
And when you're emphasizing them, it's also
correct.

202
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,910
I'm going to tell you a really silly story
of when I was a kid.

203
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,860
I always wanted to ask my parents for some
dessert, but I knew that if I just asked them,

204
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,910
"Mom, can I have some dessert?" they might
say no.

205
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,230
So I had to come up with a creative way to
ask them for some more dessert.

206
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:12,880
So me and my sister and my two neighbors,
who we always spent time with, I remember

207
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,050
crawling down the hallway towards my parents
and we said, "Oh, it's so hot in the desert.

208
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,890
Oh, it's so hot in the desert.

209
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,190
I need some dessert."

210
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,370
We were very silly.

211
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,180
So we were trying to get them to laugh and
have a little bit of fun with the difference

212
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,550
between these two words so that they would
give us dessert.

213
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:37,780
I hope this little story helps you to remember
desert and desert.

214
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
Okay.

215
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,730
Let's go to our next common vocabulary mistake.

216
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,890
Quiet and quite.

217
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:50,570
This is another one that's easy to misspell
when you're writing, because they're quite

218
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,930
similar, quite similar.

219
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,300
Let's a look at this sentence.

220
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,100
"I was very quiet when I walked up the stairs."

221
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,290
Take a look at the next sentence.

222
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,170
"He was quite noisy when he walked up the
stairs."

223
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,420
We have an opposite meaning here.

224
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,310
"I was very quiet," this means I didn't make
much noise.

225
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,810
I was very quiet when I walked up the stairs.

226
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,610
Or, "He was quite noisy."

227
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,950
We use the word quite as an emphasis.

228
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,980
"He was quite noisy."

229
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,660
He was very noisy when he walked up the stairs.

230
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,280
He was quite noisy.

231
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
Excellent.

232
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,130
So make sure that when you're writing and
when you're speaking, you use quiet and quite

233
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,310
in the right way.

234
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:42,500
Before we go onto some common pronunciation
mistakes, let's go to our final vocabulary

235
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,610
mistake that I commonly see with English learners,
and maybe this is difficult for you too.

236
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:54,750
Take a look at these two words, recipe and
receipt.

237
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,540
Let's talk about pronunciation first.

238
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:04,930
Recipe, usually, if there is an E at the end
of a word, it's silent, like the previous

239
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,260
word we talked about, quite.

240
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,360
Quite, we don't say quite-y.

241
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,740
But in this word we say the final E, recipe.

242
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,100
Can you say it with me?

243
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,100
Recipe.

244
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,880
This is what you read that gives you instructions
for cooking.

245
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,070
I found a great recipe for making chocolate
chip cookies.

246
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,650
A recipe.

247
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,610
But that's second word, receipt.

248
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,280
So many letters that are cut out.

249
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:41,990
Receipt, re-, it sounds like R-U, receipt,
seat.

250
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:50,890
So the P is cut out and the E-I is just an
E sound, receipt, receipt.

251
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,610
This is the paper that you get when you go
to the store.

252
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,810
The cashier will hand you the receipt.

253
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,750
And it's a list of everything that you've
purchased.

254
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,570
So let's look at these sample sentences.

255
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,650
"I followed the recipe well, why are my cookies
so awful?"

256
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:13,570
The instructions for cooking, I followed the
recipe well, why are my cookies so awful?

257
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:21,279
Or you can say, "I checked the receipt, and
oh, I bought salt instead of sugar."

258
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,820
Let me tell you, if it says to put this much
sugar in your cookies, you should not put

259
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,320
this much salt in your cookies instead.

260
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,970
They will be awful.

261
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:37,820
So you can check your receipt from the store
and see, "Oh, I bought the wrong thing."

262
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,060
Oh, well, I guess that's the answer.

263
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,730
Let's go on to three common pronunciation
mistakes that I often hear my English students

264
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,850
make, but I want to make sure you can avoid
them.

265
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,720
The first one is pronunciation?

266
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,029
Mm-hmm (affirmative).

267
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,150
It's true.

268
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:59,910
This word is long, there's a lot going on,
and I often hear my English students mix up

269
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,050
this word in so many different ways.

270
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:08,330
I have heard pronunciation, pronunciation,
pronunciation.

271
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:12,040
It's very mixed together in the middle because
there's a lot of syllables.

272
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,760
So what I would like to do is I want to break
down this word.

273
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:23,370
We're going to make it nice and clear and
simple to understand and to say, "Are you

274
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,930
ready?"

275
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,480
Pruh-nun-see-AYE-shun.

276
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,640
That T-I-O-N is going to sound like an sh,
shun.

277
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,680
Let's try to speed it up a little bit.

278
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,910
Pronunciation, pronunciation, pronunciation.

279
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,400
How's your English pronunciation?

280
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,970
How's your English pronunciation?

281
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,950
I hope you can pronounce the word pronunciation
correctly now.

282
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,060
Have you ever been walking down the grocery
store aisles and thought, "Ugh, I can't find

283
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,310
what I'm looking for.

284
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,730
What aisle is the sugar on?

285
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,420
I need to buy sugar and not salt for my cookies
next time."

286
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,010
Well, this word aisle, A-I-S-L-E.

287
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,970
Why in the world is it spelled A-I-S-L-E?

288
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,420
Good question.

289
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,110
But it is pronounced eye, like your eye, eye-ul.

290
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,110
Aisle.

291
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,110
Aisle.

292
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,410
So forget the A at the beginning, forget the
S, and just say aisle.

293
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,410
Aisle.

294
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,000
It sounds like the contraction, I will.

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,180
I'll go to the store and walk down the aisle
to look for some sugar.

296
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,690
Aisle, aisle, this is the row in a store where
you might find different things.

297
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,650
So you can go down different aisles.

298
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,990
And if you're in a store and you can't find
a product and you ask someone, "Where's the

299
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,820
sugar?" they might say, "Oh, go down aisle
eight.

300
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,980
Aisle, eight.

301
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,150
Excellent pronunciation.

302
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,880
The final common English mistake, especially
with pronunciation, that I often see my English

303
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,099
students make is with this word.

304
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,489
How do you say that word?

305
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,740
Is it drawer.

306
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
Nope.

307
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,309
Instead, there's two different ways, they're
very close, that we can pronounce this word.

308
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:23,539
You might say, "I put my clothes in the drawer,"
with a J sound, or, "I put my clothes in the

309
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:30,169
drawer," drawer, with a little bit more of
a clear D-R sound.

310
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:32,820
Drawer, drawer.

311
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,559
But for both of those words, the W is pretty
much cut out.

312
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,789
So don't let that confuse you and try to split
that and say, "Draw," like you're drawing

313
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:45,649
a picture, or "drawer."

314
00:17:45,649 --> 00:17:46,649
We don't say that.

315
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,850
Instead, it's jor or droor.

316
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,660
Both of those can be used commonly in daily
conversation.

317
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,019
So where do you put your clothes?

318
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,220
I put them in the drawer.

319
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,070
I put them in the drawer.

320
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,070
Excellent work.

321
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,129
So how did you do?

322
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:04,950
I hope that with this lesson, these mistakes
will definitely get better for you.

Let me know in the comments, what is your
favorite dessert?

329
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,149
I would love to know, is it chocolate cake,
chocolate cookies, or maybe something that's

330
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:34,640
only unique in your own country?

331
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,999
Let me know in the comments, what's your favorite
dessert?

332
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:41,570
And I'll see you again next Friday for a new
lesson here on my YouTube channel.

333
