00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,240
After years and years of learning English,

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,360
do you occasionally have those moments
where you know you made a mistake while

3
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:11,880
you were speaking, but you're not
really sure what the mistake was.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,360
Perhaps something just sounded off
or maybe somebody gave you that

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:21,790
look, that look that
says didn't sound right,

6
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,390
but I understand what you're saying.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,470
These moments irritate
my students to no end.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,870
And they often happen with
commonly confused pairs of words,

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,870
like the words recommend and suggest.

10
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,870
How exactly do you differentiate
between the meaning of these two

11
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,260
words and how they're used?

12
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,860
Both verbs are fantastic
for offering advice.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,420
The challenge is they can't
always be used interchangeably and

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,780
it can be a struggle to get the
grammatical structures correct.

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,180
So let's fix that. If
you don't already know,

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,850
I'm Annemarie with
Speak Confident English,

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,850
everything I do here is designed to help
you with the confidence you want for

18
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:10,370
your life and work in English.
By the end of this lesson today,

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,130
you will perfectly understand
the differences between suggest

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,690
and recommend you'll know exactly
how and when to use each of them.

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,360
Along with the grammars
structures you need for accuracy.

22
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,240
Be sure to stick with me
all the way to the end,

23
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:30,120
because I have a quiz for you
to make sure you've got it right

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:36,880
At first glance,

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,160
the verbs suggest and
recommend look like synonyms.

26
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,710
And it seems as though you could
use them interchangeably, however,

27
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,590
the context or the situation you're in

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,670
determines how and when to
use each of these words.

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,590
Plus there is a subtle
distinction in the definition.

30
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,660
So let's start with getting
the definitions straight.

31
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,140
To recommend means to present
something that is advisable,

32
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,060
something that is worthy of favorability.

33
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,940
Most importantly, we tend to use
this verb on a more personal level.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,330
For example,

35
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,020
when expressing opinions based
on our personal experience or our

36
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,890
preference is. For example,

37
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,090
I might say I recommend
watching The Queen's Gambit.

38
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,050
It'll keep you on the edge of your seat.

39
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:34,330
I'm recommending something based on
my personal opinion and experience,

40
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:38,650
having watched that TV show. And
I think it's worthy of your time.

41
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:43,130
The definition of to suggest
is slightly different.

42
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,720
To suggest means to introduce
something for consideration

43
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,600
or as an option.

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,440
It doesn't necessarily mean
that I think it's great.

45
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,600
It's just an option worth
considering. In other words,

46
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,960
unlike to recommend,

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,360
when we use suggest there's
less of a personal investment,

48
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,800
it's simply an option. Now that
we've got the definition straight,

49
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,200
let's take a look at the grammar
needed for accuracy when using

50
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,800
recommend or suggest.

51
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,470
And here I will want to reiterate
or underscore that it's the

52
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:25,070
context that defines how,

53
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,310
and when we use these two words
to make that easier to understand,

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,230
we're going to use three specific
situations to understand how we might

55
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,910
decide whether to use, recommend,
or suggest and how we do it.

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,540
The three situations we're going to
consider are when you want to share

57
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,740
your thoughts about
something; situation two,

58
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,380
when you want to recommend
or suggest an action,

59
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,580
something that you want someone else
to do; and situation number three,

60
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,770
when you want to recommend
something or someone

61
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,490
to someone. Let's start
with that first situation.

62
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,130
When you want to share your
thoughts about something,

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,370
when you want to share your opinion on
something, a topic, a product, a service,

64
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,239
the word you use will depend on
whether your comes from a personal

65
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,840
experience or preference,

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,400
or if it's just a generic
thought one idea of many,

67
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,840
but you don't really have
any personal investment.

68
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,640
Whether you choose to use,
recommend or suggest in both cases,

69
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,120
you're going to use the
following structure.

70
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:43,470
You'll use the verb recommend or
suggest followed by the object.

71
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,710
Here are a couple of examples.

72
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,030
Imagine that a tourist randomly
stops you on the street to ask,

73
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,070
are there any good cafes
around here? And you might say,

74
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,630
I recommend the cafe down the street.

75
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,900
We have our verb recommend
followed by the object, the cafe.

76
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,700
I recommend the cafe down the street.

77
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,060
And because we've chosen
to use the verb recommend,

78
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,620
it indicates that you have some
personal experience with this cafe

79
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,380
and you prefer it. On the other hand,

80
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,340
you might be at work trying
to tackle some problem and

81
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,890
in recommending or advising a
course of action, you might say,

82
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,850
I suggest a meeting to finalize
the details of the contract.

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,090
Once again, we're following the
structure, suggest followed by the object,

84
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,370
a meeting. And by using the word suggest,

85
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,760
it's not really a personal preference,

86
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:47,200
it's just an idea that
others should consider.

87
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,480
And it seems like an appropriate
option, an appropriate course of action.

88
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,040
And now let's move on to situation
number two when we might want to use

89
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,760
recommend or suggest. This is when
we want to focus on an action,

90
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,520
we want to recommend or suggest
that someone does something.

91
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,640
They take action. When we're
encouraging someone to take action,

92
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:16,200
there are two structures we
can use. The first is to use,

93
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,910
recommend or suggest followed by a gerund.

94
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,670
A gerund is one of those I N G nouns.

95
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,790
And we'll look at some
examples in just a moment,

96
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,110
but the second possible structure
is the verb recommend or suggest

97
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,830
followed by that. And
then a subject and a verb.

98
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,580
Let's take a look at that for or
structure more closely. We use,

99
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,860
recommend or suggest with a
gerund when we're recommending

100
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,100
an action that we hope will
happen in the immediate future.

101
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,100
For example, if you take a friend to
your favorite restaurant, you might say,

102
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,340
I recommend ordering the house special.

103
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,890
The recommended course of action is order.

104
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,290
You want your friend to order something
specific and you hope that it's going to

105
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:10,450
happen in the next few minutes.
Here's another example.

106
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,250
Let's say the weather forecast indicates
that a huge storm is coming your way.

107
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:20,560
And one of your friends is just
about to go on a trip. You might say,

108
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:25,440
I suggest waiting until the storm
passes before heading up north.

109
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:27,020
Again,

110
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,840
the course of action that
you're recommending is that
your friend waits for the

111
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:34,800
storm to pass. Before we
look at the second structure,

112
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,390
let's go back to those two examples and
think about the choice between using

113
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,910
recommend and suggest.
In the first example,

114
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,950
you have personal experience
with this restaurant.

115
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,790
You've had this specific dish before,

116
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,750
so there's some personal investment
there. You have a preference.

117
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:01,020
So the verb recommend is a great
choice. In the second example,

118
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:06,460
the verb suggest indicates that it's
an option. It definitely makes sense.

119
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,620
It's a great option to consider,

120
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,380
but it's not something that
you've personally experienced.

121
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,700
And now that second structure we
talked about with recommend or suggest

122
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:21,610
followed by that, then
a subject and a verb.

123
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:26,650
This is particularly effective
when you want to emphasize by

124
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,770
whom the action should
be taken. For example,

125
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,210
I recommend that you focus
on doing more field work

126
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,450
before you write your
dissertation. In that example,

127
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,920
we have recommend that
you and the verb focus.

128
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,920
Here's another example.

129
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,520
I suggest that everyone uses their
vacation days before the end of the year

130
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,640
because HR will not be
carrying unused days forward.

131
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:56,740
Again,

132
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,680
we have that structure that is
focused on everyone in the office.

133
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,520
I suggest that everyone uses.

134
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,400
And now our third and last
situation for this topic on

135
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,240
confusing word pairs is
when you want to recommend

136
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:18,990
something or someone to someone,

137
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,190
and as you may have
guessed in this scenario,

138
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,630
we only use the verb recommend
here's the structure we follow.

139
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,190
We include the verb,

140
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:32,550
recommend followed by
an object and then for

141
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,460
something or two someone.

142
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,500
Let's take a look at two examples where
we can see this structure clearly.

143
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,940
Let's say you just finished a fantastic
book and you're recommending it to

144
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,820
everyone in your next conversation
with a friend, you might say,

145
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,020
I recommend The Alchemist
for your next book club pick.

146
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,450
It's a beautiful story.
Let's look at that structure.

147
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,970
I recommend The Alchemist,

148
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:05,450
the object for your next book club

149
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,650
pick. And now a second example.

150
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,930
Let's say that someone at work is asking
you for some assistance or information,

151
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,650
but it's not really
your area of expertise.

152
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,040
And you know that another team member
would have the answer to this question.

153
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,680
So you might say,

154
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,840
I recommend Isabella for more
information on this client,

155
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,360
she's worked with them exclusively. Okay,

156
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,680
now that you have three
clear situations in which you

157
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:38,670
might use to suggest or
recommend, let's do a quiz.

158
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:43,030
I have four questions for you. And based
on what you've learned in this lesson,

159
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,070
I want you to choose the
correct verb for each sentence.

160
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,510
Be sure to think carefully about
the context and whether it is

161
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,830
a personal opinion based on
experience or preference or simp

162
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,380
a thought an option.

163
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,140
And don't forget to consider
the grammar tense as well.

164
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,740
Question number one, the lawyer ___

165
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:13,620
that we review the contract carefully
before finalizing the details

166
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,690
and signing, what do you think what's
the best choice in that sentence?
