00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Hi everyone! Welcome back to another

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,660
mmmEnglish lesson.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,980
I'm in London at the moment and I decided to contact

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,680
another English teacher who has a channel on Youtube!

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,940
You might know her.  It's Lucy from English with Lucy!

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,900
We are going to meet together on camera

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,060
so that you can learn a little bit more

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,200
about how to introduce yourself in English!

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,180
Hello! Hi! It's so nice to meet you!

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,880
Lovely to finally meet you.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,140
How are you?

12
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,380
I'm well, how are you?

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,080
I'm good thank you. How are you?

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,340
How are you finding London?

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,260
So far it has been incredible, like I've been, you know,

16
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,040
working really hard but also having lots of fun as well.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:48,440
It's just the weather that's not quite my cup of tea!

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,700
It's not great! It's a bit grey at the moment.

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,300
It's a little bit grey and a little bit drizzly,

20
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,080
a little bit cold for me!

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,140
I've spent a few days up in Scotland as well,

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,360
which was even colder, so I guess now..

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,980
What's it like in Australia?

24
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,780
At the moment we're just going into summer

25
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,600
so it's starting to get warm.

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,180
I'm envious!

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,500
I'm looking forward to getting back there actually.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,680
Do you live near the beach?

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
I do, yeah! I live in Melbourne right near the beach. Yeah.

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,660
And how long are you going to stay here for?

31
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,860
Probably just another few days actually

32
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,480
so I've been here for about two weeks already.

33
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,820
Do you miss home?

34
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,040
Not really! It's nice to get out and explore

35
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,120
and see new things and meet lots of new

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,420
people, like yourself! So yeah.

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:32,820
Yeah I love travelling.

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:35,940
Do you? So where have you been traveling recently?

39
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,660
Well, I used to live in Spain. I got to see quite a lot

40
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,600
of Spain. I haven't been traveling recently.

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,560
I did go on a holiday to Spain this summer

42
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,440
but I'm looking to move abroad very soon!

43
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,060
Really?

44
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,620
I'm looking to go back to Spain very, very soon.

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,080
I would love to visit Spain! I've never been.

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,820
Haven't you? No.

47
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,620
Have you been to many other countries?

48
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,640
I have been.  Yeah I've travelled quite a lot.

49
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,340
I've been to Greece, so you know, warm, beautiful

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,820
beaches, lovely in summer - that kind of thing.

51
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,720
I went to Greece this summer! I went to Kefalonia,

52
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,680
one of the islands.

53
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,120
It is such a gorgeous part of the world.

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,100
The food! And the food!

55
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,500
It's like a mix of Greek and Italian food together,

56
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,220
just my two favorites!

57
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,860
The European summer is lovely.

58
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,280
It's a shame about the winter!

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,180
I know! I'll make sure that I'm back here

60
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,380
for the summer next time!

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,380
And you need to visit Spain!

62
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,520
Yes!

63
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,880
Spain is my favourite country in the world!

64
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,040
Yes, I know! It's been on my list for many years.

65
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,260
And the food there - if you like like the Greek food,

66
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,920
then you're going to love Spanish food!

67
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,100
I'm a bit tired of eating Spanish food in restaurants

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,480
anywhere else in the world except in Spain.

69
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,160
It's just not the same! It's not the same!

70
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,940
And I'm looking forward to having my first proper

71
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,300
'siesta' as well!

72
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,180
Have you never had one before? We need to correct that

73
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,280
Not officially, no.

74
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,900
So, I've seen on your channel that you quite like cooking.

75
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,400
Yes.

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,620
How did you get into that?

77
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,300
Well to be honest, I learnt a lot of it

78
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,540
from my my fiancÃ©, Shah.

79
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,040
So he is an excellent cook and I guess when you

80
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,060
get in a relationship with someone,

81
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,620
you have to kind of 'up the ante' a bit

82
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,520
so he was a really good cook and I needed to

83
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,400
impress him with my skills!

84
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,440
Well, cooking for one just, it's not same, is it?

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,720
Actually, I'm awful at cooking for one.

86
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,280
I always make about six meals worth

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,820
and then I have to end up freezing it,

88
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,840
which is kind of helpful

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,700
but I'm not good at cooking for one.

90
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,480
Well I recently moved back with my parents

91
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,280
for a short while before moving on to another country

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,280
and the best part of it is is being able to cook

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,120
for three other people

94
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,140
I thought you were going to say that you

95
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,520
the best part about it is you get like home-cooked meals

96
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,080
every night!

97
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,180
No! I make them myself!

98
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:55,780
You do it yourself?

99
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,640
Yeah! That's like my sort of agreement.

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,540
You can have me here, and I'll cook for you!

101
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,860
What's your specialty?

102
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Well I did travel in Italy a little bit. 

103
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,760
Actually, I didn't go to Italy, I went to Palermo in Sicily!

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,100
And they taught me how to make a mean risotto!

105
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,200
But I really like experimenting, so I kind of ask my

106
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,940
dad and my brother because they're the most

107
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,680
appreciative: "What do you fancy?" And then I try and

108
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,600
do it but with a twist!

109
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,660
So, if they want Mexican, then I'll do some sort of..

110
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,980
I like to invent!

111
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,660
We're quite opposite in that sense,

112
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,840
I'm very much like a find a really good recipe

113
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,800
and make the recipe.

114
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,940
See I like to find a couple of recipes,

115
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,980
take inspiration from them and then rewrite it myself!

116
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,560
That sounds interesting and very exciting!

117
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,460
So, what's your number one recipe then?

118
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,740
I love cooking Thai food actually!

119
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,980
I do love a Thai green curry!

120
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,620
Yeah.

121
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,300
But I find it hard to find a good paste.

122
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,600
Well I make all of my pastes myself!

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,840
So, that's why mine are so good! But yeah, it's

124
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,840
all about the paste, right? So you cook that first,

125
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,880
then you deal with the rest of it.

126
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,420
So, you must have lived in quite a few countries then?

127
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,080
I have, I've definitely travelled and visited a few

128
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,760
I've only lived in.  I was born in Australia

129
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,540
and I've lived most of my life in Australia

130
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,300
but I have spent some time living in Vietnam

131
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,960
and also in Malaysia.

132
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,140
I've never been to Asia at all!

133
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,750
Haven't you?

134
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,640
In fact, I have only ever left Europe twice.

135
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,700
Once was to go to Jamaica

136
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,560
and once was to go to Grenada

137
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,740
Oh, really? You're a Caribbean kind of girl.

138
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,920
I've lived in, just in Spain. I lived in Madrid

139
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,700
and I lived in Seville.

140
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,740
Beautiful part of the world!

141
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,820
And London and the countryside in England.

142
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,360
I'm from Bedfordshire.

143
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,940
What's the countryside like?

144
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,760
So green that sometimes when I get off the train,

145
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,900
I have to put my sunglasses on because it hurts my eyes!

146
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,560
It's beautiful! Lovely in spring and summer.

147
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,460
Autumn is stunning

148
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,480
because you get all of the fall of the leaves.

149
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,240
Yeah.

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,300
And winter's nice. It does snow, occasionally.

151
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,620
Where I'm from it's quite flat, but if you go further,

152
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,240
quite flat but if you go further,

153
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,400
further afield you can go down hills and everything.

154
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,140
Yeah.

155
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,900
But I'm looking to live in some other countries, soon!

156
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,280
Not sure!

157
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,820
That's one of the things that I love most about teaching

158
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,200
and meeting new people is there are so many

159
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,400
opportunities to, you know, travel and go to

160
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:29,509
different places, and places that you never really

161
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,550
expected to go either!

162
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,520
Yeah! I mean, it's journey, isn't it? You just end up

163
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,800
doing things that you never, ever imagined

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,060
and meeting lots of random people.. like you!

165
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,340
Exactly!

166
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,200
Running into you in London!

167
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,060
Okay Emma! Well, I would love to show you

168
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,920
my neighborhood so why don't we go grab a coffee?

169
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,800
Yeah I'd love to have a little bit of a walk around.

170
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,520
That sounds great! Let's do it!

171
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,820
And have a chat? Continue chatting?

172
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,600
Okay!

173
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,300
Well, i hope you enjoyed that video about introducing

174
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,370
yourself to someone that you've never

175
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,630
met before!

176
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,300
So there was lots of small talk and

177
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,430
conversation topics that you can use

178
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,819
