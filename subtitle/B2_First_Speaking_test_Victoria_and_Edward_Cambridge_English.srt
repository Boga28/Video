1
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,760
Good afternoon. Hello. My name is Jenny Cooke

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,440
and this is my colleague, Jill Budgie.
Hello.

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,960
And your names are?

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,960
My name is Victoria.

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,160
My name is Edward.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,440
Can I have your mark sheets, please?

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,480
Of course.

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,120
Thank you.

9
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,320
Where are you from, Victoria?

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,200
I'm from Germany. I'm from the
north coast of Germany.

11
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,560
And it's very nice there because
I live close to the sea.

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,280
And Edward, where are you from?

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm from Peru. I live in the capital,
Lima. It's near the coast.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
First, we'd like to know something
about you. Victoria

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,840
how do you like to spend your evenings?

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,960
In Germany, I like to go to my horse

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,040
and now I go
to the gym or do something else

18
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,680
or spend time with my friends.

19
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,000
And, Edward, tell us about a festival
or celebration in Peru.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,760
Well, in Peru, there is a lot of 
festival. There is one called Mistura.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,560
It's about food because in Peru, we have
a lot of very different kind of foods.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,200
So, all that chefs
and plates goes there.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,160
And there is a big festival in Lima. 
I love it.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,800
Victoria, do you use the Internet much?

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,600
At home, not really, but now I'm
in England, so I used to Skype very often

26
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,200
and to go, yeah
and look films at the Internet

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,120
or listen to music
more because I have more free time now.

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,840
Edward, tell us about a film
you really like. A film?

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, I really like cars and action

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,560
so maybe Fast Furious was quite
interesting for me, the last one. Six.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,200
I find it really good

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,120
because there is a quite expensive cars, 
there are things I like. Thank you.

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,640
In this part of the test, I'm going to
give each of you two photographs.

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,480
I'd like you to talk about your 
photographs on your own for about a minute

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,560
and also to answer a short question
about your partner's photographs.

36
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,880
Victoria, it's your turn first.
Here are your photographs.

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
They show people who are helping other
people in different situations.

38
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,680
I'd like you to compare the photographs

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,520
and say how important it is to help people
in these situations. OK. All right? Yeah.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
In the first picture, I see a sportsman

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,040
a footballer, and somebody, I think he
has a cramp or something like this

42
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,520
and somebody helps him. In the second 
picture, there's a policeman. The lady

43
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,240
I think she asks for the direction because
she's confusing in the city.

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,240
She's new or a tourist. I think
both are very important persons

45
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,760
because one has, in the first picture,
he has pain.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,160
In the second picture,
she needs help as well.

47
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:57,640
So, I think that are both very important 
persons for the people in each situation.

48
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,600
I think I would prefer to help

49
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,400
people who make some sports
because I'm like sports.

50
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,520
And it's really interesting to
see other people. And I-- Thank

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,720
you. Edward, do you find it easy to ask
for help when you have a problem?

52
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,600
Yes, I have an experience in London.

53
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:33,240
I was looking for a hostel, and I ask
ambulance for some special place

54
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,920
for a cheaper hostel, and they helped me.

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,280
Thank you. Can I have the booklet, please?

56
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,120
Now, Edward, here are your photographs.

57
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,080
They show people spending time
in different gardens.

58
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,280
I'd like you to compare the
photographs and say

59
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,480
what you think the people are enjoying
about spending time in these gardens?

60
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,760
OK. All right? Yes.

61
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:09,320
Well, in the first picture, I see a girl, 
a young girl in a garden with

62
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:14,960
I think, a special plants there,
have a special care about them.

63
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,880
In the second, I think a big gardens where
people can go and have a picnic

64
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,640
or spend some time with family,
a time to relax.

65
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,880
I think, both cases, they are all enjoy
the things. In the first one

66
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,160
I think that girl like to

67
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:43,480
make these plants in maybe his garden. 
Maybe she's going to eat them. In

68
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,400
the second one, they like
to spend time in the air, free air

69
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,600
or maybe free things
is good. Both are enjoying each.

70
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,240
Thank you. Victoria, which garden would
you prefer to spend time in?

71
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:10,040
I think I would prefer to enjoy in my own
garden, so in the first picture

72
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,360
because it is really enjoyable
to see the plants grow up

73
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,000
and which colour they have.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,160
And so, I think it is nice
when you sit on the terrace

75
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,760
and have a look in your own garden.

76
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,840
Thank you. Can I have the booklet, please?
Thank you.

77
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,120
Now, I'd like you to talk about something
together for about two minutes.

78
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,120
I'd like you to imagine that a town
wants more tourists to visit.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,200
Here are some ideas they're thinking about
and a question for you to discuss.

80
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,040
First, you have some time
to look at the task.

81
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,200
Now, talk to each other
about why these ideas

82
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,480
would attract more tourists to the town.

83
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,760
OK. Maybe we can choose one.

84
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,600
Yeah, OK. Won't we like to talk
about a building nightclubs?

85
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,200
What we think about it? Yes, maybe.

86
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,800
Nightclubs, I think are focus for young 
people. I think that not young

87
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:40,400
people like to visit towns for 
a nightclub. What about having more shops?

88
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,520
I think that shopping is a special thing.

89
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:48,200
Shops is, I think, as well, a good idea
because they can go with the whole family

90
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,800
or sometimes parents can go on their own
and the childrens are for their own.

91
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,640
But I think it would be nice when it is a
shopping area and not shops on the street

92
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,920
because when the children want to go 
alone, maybe it is a little bit dangerous.

93
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,120
So, maybe we can be providing new parks.

94
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,840
Parks, parks. I don't really like parks.

95
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,880
So, because I don't want to have a picnic
in the park, but maybe it is nice.

96
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,960
What do you think about it?

97
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm sorry, I can't agree with you.
I like park

98
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,640
because most people like 
to spend time with their family

99
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,960
doing a picnic on the free air if it's

100
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,960
a good weather. So, maybe more tourists
can go to the parks.

101
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,480
Yeah. Well, but maybe we can--

102
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,280
what do you think about
building Holly's flats?

103
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,000
I think it is a good idea, but I'm not 
really sure if everybody wants to live in

104
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
a holiday flat, but I think it can be
very interesting when it's nice

105
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,120
yeah, it's a nice flat. 
What's your opinion?

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,560
I think that is not good
for tourists or for

107
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,080
the interests of them and putting
up security cameras also.

108
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,640
I think they are more for
people who live there.

109
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,960
Yeah, I think when I went to holiday and I
know there are still cameras around me--

110
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
Thank you.

111
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,720
Now, you have about a minute to decide
which idea would be best for the town.

112
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,800
OK. OK.

113
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,360
I think the shopping areas
is really nice because

114
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,920
the whole family has something of it.

115
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,640
I also think providing parks.
So, we have to discuss

116
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,600
which is the best one.

117
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:54,000
OK. Yes. I like parks because also
help for the weather and good for

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,280
the environment. 
When you go to a new place

119
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,800
you also visit the parks, 
that kind of things.

120
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,680
OK, maybe I would change my opinion
when I see a nice park. It's possible.

121
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,080
Yes? So, if we can find a new parks?

122
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Maybe. I have to try it, yeah.

123
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:20,240
Yes. It was the best option. I think so.
But not about discussing the nightclub

124
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:28,000
or putting security cameras because they
are more for determinate kinds of people.

125
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,560
Thank you. Can I
have the booklet, please?

126
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Thank you.

127
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:41,120
Victoria, do you think you have to spend
a lot of money to have a good holiday?

128
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,440
Not really. I think when you're well
organised and you look early enough

129
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,080
for something, it might be possible
to make it less expensive

130
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,680
to go on a good holiday.

131
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,960
So, it depends what I want
to do, but I try to.

132
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,120
What do you think, Edward?

133
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,520
Well, I think that is not good to have
a lot of money and spend on holidays.

134
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,720
I think the most important is the person
who you enjoy who you go with

135
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,240
on holiday so you can enjoy
more that place.

136
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,520
Edward, some people say
we travel too much these days

137
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,000
and shouldn't go on so many holidays.

138
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
What do you think?

139
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,840
Well, yes, it can be if you have
enough money to travel

140
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,400
well, it's great to go to
new places and visit new cities

141
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,360
and learn more about the culture, also.

142
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,120
What do you think, Victoria?

143
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,960
I think it's nice to travel a lot because
you can see more of the whole world

144
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,800
and from the culture and how 
the people live. So, I think it's nice.

145
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,800
Do you think people have enough
time for holidays these days?

146
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,880
Well, it depends of the person.

147
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Because a businessman is always
busy and have to travel a lot

148
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,360
but not for that kind of issues. He 
have to make busy for other people.

149
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,240
Yeah, I totally agree with you.

150
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,920
I think sometimes it's difficult to travel
because you haven't got enough time

151
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,480
because you have to work hard
to earn money.  So, it is difficult.

152
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Why do you think people like
to go away on holiday?

153
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,840
I think it's nice because you can, when
you're far away from your home

154
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,920
you have not any thinks about
your work and at your firm.

155
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,200
So, you are far away and you don't
care what's in your home.

156
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
Yes, I agree with you. 
I have the same idea.

157
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,760
I think that when you go out of your
home and you can't relax because

158
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,560
you do a new things, maybe you can
try other things. So, it's interesting.

159
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,120
What can people do to have a
good holiday in Germany?

160
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,040
I don't know exactly, because I don't want
to make holidays in Germany because

161
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,360
the weather is all the time 
cloudy and bad, but I like it.

162
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,400
It is nearly the same as
in England, I think. So. 

163
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:40,520
And we have the sea, and so, they can go
surfing and you can visit small islands

164
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
and it's nice.

165
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,880
I think so. And in Peru?

166
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,240
In Peru, there are a lot of places you
can visit. There is Machu Picchu

167
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,560
very famous place of Nazca lines.

168
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,880
Also, Peru have a lot of beaches, pretty
beaches, where you can choose if you want

169
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,600
like the jungle or the coast. There is
a lot of places where you can visit.

00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,680
Thank you. That is the
end of the test. Thank you.
