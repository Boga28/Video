1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240


2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,590
Our next guest is sitting
in the audience right now.

3
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,570
And it could be you.

4
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,850
Everybody stand up.

5
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,780


6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,459
All right.

7
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:09,750
And you have to be honest here.

8
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,640
Stay standing if you
watch my show every day.

9
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,210
Every day.

10
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:18,810


11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,770
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

12
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,470
Stay standing if you have
written me over 30 letters.

13
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,420


14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,130
Stay standing if
you're originally

15
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:33,490
from the Dominican Republic.

16
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:46,530


17
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,060
Stay standing if you've learned
English by watching my show.

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,036
Diana, come on down.

19
00:00:54,036 --> 00:01:12,808


20
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:13,800
Hi.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,671
Diana Aquino, right?

22
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:16,170
Yes.

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:16,810
Hello.

24
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,310
Hi.

25
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,275
Hi.

26
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:19,370
I love you.

27
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,784
I love you, too.

28
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:21,450
I love you, too.

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:22,530
You're very sweet.

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,560
So, first of all,
it was a great way

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,890
to find out who watches
my show everyday.

32
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,180


33
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,660
So when did you move here
from the Dominican Republic?

34
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,231
I moved here on May of 2011.

35
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:39,730
OK.

36
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,396
And you didn't speak
any English at all?

37
00:01:41,396 --> 00:01:41,930
No.

38
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,500
I literally speak two words.

39
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,790
It was hello and goodbye.

40
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,361
The most important words here.

41
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:47,860
Really.

42
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,420
Of course.

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:48,920
All right.

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,550
And so you learned English
from watching my show.

45
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,180
And how did you do that?

46
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,720
Oh.

47
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,220
OK.

48
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,760
That's a funny story.

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,749
I was just flipping
through the channels,

50
00:01:58,749 --> 00:01:59,790
just flipping through it.

51
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,020
And I just came to your face.

52
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,600
You were there I asked
my mom, "Who is that?"

53
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,790
And my mom was
like, "She's Ellen.

54
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,750
She's really funny.

55
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,610
Just watch the show.

56
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,590
You will love her.

57
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,580
I was like, "But I don't
understand what she's saying.

58
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,360
She was like, "Me either.

59
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
But just watch it.

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,514
She's hilarious.

61
00:02:16,514 --> 00:02:17,950
And then I was like, "OK.

62
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,910
I watch it."

63
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,490
I didn't understand anything
you were saying, literally.

64
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm sorry, but I didn't.

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,370
And then, at the end of
the show, it was like,

66
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,960
there was just this
word that you say.

67
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,090
You say, "Be kind."

68
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,630
And then that word
stuck with me.

69
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,660
You know when you get
this word that you really

70
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,340
want to see what it is.

71
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,150
I got my dictionary.

72
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,950
I looked it up.

73
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,260
And I kept looking
at the wrong word,

74
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,080
with the C instead
of the K. Oh, my God.

75
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,200
But I got it.

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,810
And I saw how the word
kind, and it means kindness,

77
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,940
to be good to other people.

78
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,375
And that stuck with me
forever, because I'm loud.

79
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:00,990
I'm affectionate.

80
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,690
I like to be kind to everyone.

81
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,110
So that just stuck with me
to be who I am, with myself.

82
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,960
So yeah.

83
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,430
That's so sweet.

84
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,410
I love that.

85
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,880
I love that.

86
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,390
So you said that you're
very affectionate.

87
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,950
I know that our
culture is not as

88
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,180
affectionate as your culture.

89
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:20,540
Right?

90
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,040
Yes.

91
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,860
Y'all are very affectionate,
and Americans are very uptight.

92
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,345
Over there in Dominican,
we are so loud.

93
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:29,420
And we know everybody.

94
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,940
We know every neighbor by name.

95
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,770
We hug.

96
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,630
We kiss in the cheek.

97
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,880
And we hug you no matter what.

98
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,254
If we meet you for the first
time, we will still hug you.

99
00:03:39,254 --> 00:03:40,580
We still crazy.

100
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,740
So I just keep doing that.

101
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:41,980
Yeah.

102
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,880
You keep doing it.

103
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,460
You keep hugging them.

104
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,660
You kiss them in the cheek.

105
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,170
Of course.

106
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:45,950
I do it.

107
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,450
All right.

108
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,950
And so you're putting
yourself through college.

109
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,680
You're a math tutor,
And what else do you Do

110
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,310
I'm a math tutor right now and
I'm a cashier, sixth floor,

111
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,910
in a retail store.

112
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,920
In a retail store.

113
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,870
So all right.

114
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,430
So I have a gift
for you, because you

115
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,130
said you learned
English watching me.

116
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,130
So I have the Ellen
DeGeneres Dictionary.

117
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,630
All right.

118
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,085
Thank you.

119
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:13,731
All right.

120
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:18,250
So Let's see.

121
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:18,749
All right.

122
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,269
The first word of course,
it starts with an Andy.

123
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:22,830
And it's a noun.

124
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,220
And the definition
is an average human.

125
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,800
OK.

126
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,820
I love Andy.

127
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,540
He's so cool.

128
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,015
I love Andy.

129
00:04:32,015 --> 00:04:33,360
I love him, too.

130
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,100
And then we have a Bachelor.

131
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,920
And that's a noun, a television
show Ellen tries not to watch

132
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,850
but inevitably gets sucked
back into every season.

133
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,610
It's OK.

134
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,030
Me too.

135
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,830
I know.

136
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,020
They pull you in.

137
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,550
And then we have glitter.

138
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,150
It's a noun.

139
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,240
Tiny pieces of sparkly material
that make me an absolute mess

140
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,580
and should be illegal.

141
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,430
Oh, my God.

142
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:54,930
Right.

143
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,360
Then we go further back in the
dictionary we have Shutterfly.

144
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,930
It's a noun.

145
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,330
It's an incredible company
that loves sharing life's joy

146
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,220
and wants to help you
with your education

147
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:10,755
by giving you a
check for $10,000.

148
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:11,745
Oh, my God.

149
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:15,705


150
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,190
Thank you so much!

151
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,360
You're welcome.

152
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,860
Hi.

153
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,400
I'm Andy.

154
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,740
Ellen asked me to remind you
to subscribe to her channel

155
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,080
so you can see more
awesome videos, like videos

156
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,790
of me getting scared or
saying embarrassing things,

157
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,220
like ball peen hammer.

158
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,980
And also some videos of
Ellen and other celebrities,

159
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,670
if you're into
that sort of thing.

160
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,220
God!

161
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,642
