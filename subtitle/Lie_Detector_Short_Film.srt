00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,000
So Mr. Hanson.

2
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:13,833
As you know we have all prospective employees take a lie detector test prior to joining our firm. 

3
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:18,499
So if you don’t mind we're going to begin with a couple of control questions.

4
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:20,874
Should I be hooked up to something?

5
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:22,333
With the old system, yes. 

6
00:00:22,624 --> 00:00:26,624
But with the new Lie Detector 3000, it's programmed to go off when it hears you tell a lie. 

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,166
For example, go ahead and tell an obvious lie.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Grass is blue.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,498
[BEEP]

10
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:33,624
I am a tall, black man.

11
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:34,083
[BEEP]

12
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:36,000
I’ve never seen Jersey Shore.

13
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:36,499
[BEEP]

14
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,749
I love it. I’ve never missed one. 

15
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:38,666
I’ve heard good things. 

16
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,832
Now go ahead and say something that is true so we can properly calibrate the machine.

17
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,790
I have a twelve-inch penis.

18
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,874
That’s kind of weird, it should have gone off.

19
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:53,333
Why?

20
00:00:53,624 --> 00:00:55,499
Because there's no way you…

21
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:56,832
I have a twelve-inch penis.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Actually, it might be thirteen.

23
00:00:58,041 --> 00:00:58,541
[BEEP]

24
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,000
No? 

25
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:00,041
I guess it’s twelve.

26
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,416
Wait, seriously?

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,125
Hey Mike, did you get a chance to email me those mission statements?

28
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,416
Uh yeah! I did it last night.

29
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:05,790
[BEEP]

30
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:06,832
I did it this morning.

31
00:01:06,874 --> 00:01:07,166
[BEEP]

32
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,499
All right! I haven't even started yet.

33
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:10,832
Wow Mike, you're the best!

34
00:01:10,874 --> 00:01:11,166
[BEEP]

35
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:13,125
You suck. I’ll be back at my desk working.

36
00:01:13,166 --> 00:01:13,582
[BEEP]

37
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:15,499
I’ll be playing Angry Birds on my phone.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,166
Please state your full name?

39
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,499
Dane Christopher Hanson.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,749
Is it true you that reside at 1444 North Sierra Bonita Avenue?

41
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,416
Yes. Apartment 3.

42
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,333
How do you do it, man?

43
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:35,208
Oh, when I moved here I went on Westside Rentals.

44
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,000
No…

45
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,083
It’s like 80 dollars.

46
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:40,749
No, how do you live with a twelve-inch penis. I mean, how is that even possible? 

47
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:44,915
Okay, I’m getting a little uncomfortable with this line of questioning.

48
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:47,499
I'm sorry, I’m sorry. You’re right. 

49
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:52,166
I mean it’s just that twelve-inches, that is like a freaking beef bus! You know what I’m sayin’?

50
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:56,499
Why are you- why are you so concerned about my penis anyhow? I mean, are you gay or something?

51
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,000
What? No!

52
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,333
[BEEP]

53
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,832
Hey! Nobody loves pussy more than I do!

54
00:02:01,874 --> 00:02:02,333
[BEEP]

55
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,208
All right. I'm a flaming homosexual. But do me a favor? 

56
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:07,250
Don't tell anybody because nobody knows.

57
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,083
[BEEP]

58
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:09,333
Everybody knows.

59
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,333
So wait, tell people?

60
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,250
No! 

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,416
Have you ever been fired from a job before?

62
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:15,832
No.

63
00:02:15,874 --> 00:02:16,291
[BEEP]

64
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:16,915
3 times.

65
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,000
Have you ever stolen from an employer before?

66
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:19,291
No.

67
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:19,666
[BEEP]

68
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:21,832
All right! Dammit! 

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,666
How much would you say you've stolen before?

70
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:24,250
Hundred dollars.

71
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:24,749
[BEEP]

72
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:25,416
500 dollars.

73
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:25,749
[BEEP]

74
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:26,624
So much I’ve lost count.

75
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,208
[BEEP]

76
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:30,458
44,793 dollars. 

77
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That’s a lot of money, Dane.

78
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,208
Well- 

79
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:35,250
I had Cancer.

80
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:35,915
[BEEP]

81
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,208
I bought a boat. 

82
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,749
And named it Cancer.

83
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:45,125
I'm going to be honest, Dane. This interview is going really well.

84
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:45,416
Yeah?

85
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:46,000
[BEEP]

86
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,790
No. This is the worst interview I’ve ever been a part of. 

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,499
Normally, you’d be gone. 

88
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:54,250
However, company policy dictates I ask you one final question.

89
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:55,166
Okay.

90
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,749
Would you ever have sex with a man in order to get a job?

91
00:02:58,874 --> 00:02:59,208
No.

92
00:02:59,250 --> 00:02:59,666
[BEEP]

93
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:02,166
Welcome to the firm.
