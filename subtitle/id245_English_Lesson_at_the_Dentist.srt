00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:01,360
Hey everybody!

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,520
Welcome back to my YouTube channel.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,800
My name's Ariannita la Gringa and 
today I'm here at the dentist,  

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,640
and I'm going to get my teeth cleaned.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,280
In this video, I will show you the process

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,280
of how to book an appointment,

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,080
how to get your teeth cleaned,

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,360
and I will also talk with a dentist.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,560
Let's start the video!

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,840
But to go to the dentist, you 
have to make an appointment.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,560
I already made an appointment, 
and I have to check in over there

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,680
at the front desk so they know I've arrived.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,800
Hi, good morning.
-Good morning, how are you?

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,080
Good, how are you? I'm here for my appointment.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,560
Okay. And what time was your appointment?
-9:00.

16
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,720
And what's your last name?
-Dziadkowiec

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,480
And then is it Arianna?
-Yes.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,400
Um, I have some paperwork 
for you to fill out for me.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,720
If you could just take a few 
minutes to fill that out,

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,680
and then they'll call you back shortly.
-Thank you so much.

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,520
You're welcome.

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,680
I just checked in for my appointment,
and now I have to fill out some paperwork.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,360
On this form, it asks me my medical history,
like if I've been sick within the past 2 weeks,

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,880
whether I have any allergies or 
any of my past medical history.

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,000
And now I'm ready for my appointment, so I have 
to return this paperwork to the front desk.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,040
Hi, I just finished filling out my paperwork.
-Great, thank you so much.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,840
Go ahead and have a seat, and Carolina will call  

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,440
you back shortly.
-Okay, thank you.

29
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,920
You're welcome.

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,240
Right now I'm in the waiting area,  

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,160
and before the hygienist calls my name and 
gets me, do you know some dental vocabulary?

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,840
What's this?

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,440
This is a tooth.

34
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,280
Tooth.

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,240
And if it's plural, what do you call it?

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,760
These are teeth.

37
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,840
Teeth.

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,320
And what's this?

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,120
That's my tongue.

40
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,160
Tongue.

41
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,200
What are these?

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,840
These are gums.

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,960
Gums.

44
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,640
If I want to get straight teeth, 
what can I put in my mouth?

45
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,440
You can get braces.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,880
Braces.

47
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,480
Arianna, are you ready?
-Yes.

48
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,240
Let's go.

49
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:27,480
Let's go to room number four.
-Okay.

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,320
Carolina is a dental hygienist, and she 
helps out the dentist by cleaning my teeth.

51
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,400
She will clean my teeth today, 
and we are in a small room,  

52
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,680
and this is where we will get my teeth cleaned.

53
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,600
Are there any changes in your medical history at 
all, or do you have any pain or sensitivity today?

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I don't have any changes in my medical history, 
but I do have some sensitivity in my bottom tooth.

55
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,480
Before getting my teeth cleaned, 
I will get an x-ray of my teeth.

56
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,400
This is basically just a picture of my teeth.

57
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,600
Come with me uh to take your x-rays.
-Okay.

58
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,800
Right now I'm in the x-ray room where 
Carolina will take a picture of my teeth.

59
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,720
So why do they take X-rays of teeth?

60
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,200
Well, they take x-rays to see if you have 
any cavities or any holes in your teeth,  

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,480
or if you also have an infection.

62
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,000
This is the vest for protection.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Then you can turn around.

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm going to put this up, and then 
you're going to bite over here,

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:46,520
and then this is going to spin around, okay.

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,880
Here's some glasses for you.

67
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,520
Then a vest.

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,320
So I'm going to take some measurements

69
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,280
for your gums to see how they are doing, okay.
-Okay.

70
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,160
Open.

71
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,680
What are you putting in my mouth, 
and what do you use those things for?

72
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,240
This is a mirror, well I can look in your mouth,

73
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,480
and this is a probe, and we are
going to measure the gums with this.

74
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,519
Do you normally use an electric brush or a manual?
-A manual.

75
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,159
And how often do you floss?
-I usually floss after I eat,  

76
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,400
so in the morning, afternoon, and in the evening.

77
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
We're going to start the cleaning now.

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm going to use cavitron and suction.
-What's a suction?

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So the suction is like a little vacuum that is
going to suction your saliva

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,920
and all the water that is coming out from here.

81
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,200
I'm going to start the polishing part.

82
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:48,960
I have a prophy paste and a polisher.

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:59,640
Now the dental hygienist will floss 
in between my teeth with dental floss.

84
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,120
We are going to do fluoride.

85
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,520
What flavors do you want?

86
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,200
I have mint, bubble gum, and caramel.
-Can I get mint, please?

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,020
So there are some restrictions for fluoride.

88
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,000
You can drink water right after,

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:24,240
you have to wait 30 minutes to eat something, 
then avoid coffee, tea, and alcohol for today.

90
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,280
The hygienist just finished cleaning my teeth,  

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,000
and now she will go get the dentist 
who will just do a physical exam.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,960
By the way, Carolina is from 
Ecuador and she speaks Spanish,

93
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,280
so if you feel more comfortable speaking Spanish,
come over here to Pearce Dental Group

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,800
and get your teeth cleaned by her or one of their
many dental hygienists that speak Spanish here.

95
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,560
Hi, can you tell me a little 
bit about this machine? 

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,960
-Yeah, this is a 3D scanner, so 
we don't do impressions anymore.

97
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,920
That's old technology.

98
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
We use this primarily for diagnostics.

99
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,080
If you wanted to do something like bleach 
trays or retainers, we can make it out of this,  

100
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,000
but this is a permanent model and 
it'll be stored in the cloud for you.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,040
All right, so this is just showing your teeth,  

102
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,200
and we can show the upper teeth by themselves, 
we can show the lower teeth by themselves,

103
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,360
and we can also show how hard 
you're hitting on your teeth.

104
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,680
So the red is bad, green is good, and we 
call the front teeth the anterior teeth,

105
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,480
and the back teeth are posterior teeth.

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,960
Little dental terminology for you.

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,040
And this is called occlusion.

108
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
Right now I'm here with a dentist.

109
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,360
Are you going to check my teeth? 

110
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,800
-Today we're gonna do a check-up and 
an examination and cleaning today.

111
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,040
We're gonna look for cavities, gum disease, 
talk about things like whitening our teeth.

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,160
If you have any problems, we can 
address any problems like that.

113
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,160
So we're checking for signs of 
cavities or gum inflammation.

114
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,400
We're looking at your gum tissues to check 
and make sure there's no soft tissue cancers.

115
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,880
We do a cancer screening,  

116
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,280
so we're having a thorough check just 
to make sure we have optimum health.

117
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,960
Okay. All right.

118
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,680
And could you raise your tongue 
in the roof of the mouth?

119
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,520
Good.

120
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,920
And bite again. Great.

121
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,160
So overall your teeth are very healthy.

122
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,200
We have a couple cavities on the upper left.

123
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,360
We have a small chip in the front 
tooth, which we can discuss.

124
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,880
Also, if you're interested in ways to 
help brighten your color of your teeth,

125
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,240
we can talk about that today.

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,760
There's lots of different ways to whiten your  

127
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,880
teeth and have a great smile 
that you're really proud of.

128
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,440
But overall, you're very healthy.

129
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,160
It looks like you've had braces in the past.
-Yes.

130
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,960
The alignment of your teeth is very 
good, and that's great for longevity.

131
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,320
How can you tell if I have a cavity?

132
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,600
Sometimes a cavity will appear to be a 
different color, like a gray or a brown,  

133
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,320
darker color in the mouth, but 
sometimes you can't see them.

134
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,560
That's why we take x-rays.

135
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,200
So x-rays are necessary to 
make sure that we don't look  

136
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,280
over any potential problems that 
we can't see with our own eyes.

137
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,760
But also our patient can tell us.

138
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,880
Sometimes a patient may say they 
have temperature sensitivity,  

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,560
hot and cold sensitivity, chewing sensitivity,  

140
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,240
and sometimes a tooth just kind of aches and 
throbs, and that might be something different.

141
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:04,400
So there's different types of pain or 
sensitivities that can tell us a little bit more.

142
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
And you also said I have a chip in my tooth.

143
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
I've noticed it too.

144
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,120
Um, how can I get that fixed?

145
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,840
There's options for fixing chipped front teeth.

146
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,680
The most conservative option 
there is a product called bonding,  

147
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,200
and bonding is—think of it like something that 
adheres to the tooth that's the shade of your  

148
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,360
natural tooth—and so that's why we might want 
to whiten our teeth first, so we can up the  

149
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,280
color a little bit and then match an improved 
color if that's something you're interested in.

150
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,240
And why do patients normally 
come here to the dentist?

151
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,640
What is the most typical issue they 
have, and why do they come here?

152
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,559
What we have found is patients who come to 
the dentist on a routine basis every 6 months,  

153
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,599
over the lifetime, have fewer 
problems with their teeth.

154
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,480
The most common thing that we see are normal  

155
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,480
six-month type of checkups 
for cleanings and x-rays.

156
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,800
But another common type of appointment is an 
emergency appointment when a tooth is broken,  

157
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,720
or a tooth has discomfort, or there might be 
swelling, something like wisdom teeth coming in.

158
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,560
So there's a lot of things that can  

159
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,400
happen that might signal that you 
might need to see the dentist,  

160
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,640
but the best bet is to go on a routine basis 
so that you can avoid those types of problems.

161
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,280
What do you normally 
specialize in besides checkups?

162
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,680
A general dentist, which is what we do typically, 
are like cleanings, fillings, root canals, crowns.

163
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,040
But in our office, we have 
lots of different doctors,  

164
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,800
and we have specialists in our office too.

165
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,480
So we do things like Invisalign, cosmetic 
dentistry, dental implants, wisdom teeth.

166
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,160
People also can come in here and 
have our oral surgeon and go to  

167
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,040
sleep and get their wisdom teeth taken 
out while they're taking a little nap.

168
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,760
We do a little bit of everything here.

169
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,640
And why are people scared to go to the dentist?

170
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,600
I think the most common things that 
make going to the dentist fearful is  

171
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,960
it could be expensive, especially if we 
don't do the preventive type of care.

172
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,680
Dental pain is very intense, or it can be, 
but we have things that can help with that,  

173
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,760
like numbing agents that help deaden 
the teeth while we can work on them,  

174
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,560
and also certain medications can help too.

175
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,560
So our patients have a really good 
experience when they come to our office,  

176
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,920
so we make sure that there are answers 
for it, keeping them out of pain,  

177
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,080
and also for financial arrangements 
to help them afford treatment better.

178
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,840
Thank you so much, Dr. Pearce, 
for having this interview with  

179
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,240
me and teaching me a little bit 
about cavities and everything.

180
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,000
And if you want to get your teeth cleaned,  

181
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,800
come here to Pearce Dental 
Group to get your teeth cleaned.

182
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,960
Thank you so much.

183
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,160
Hi, what's your name, and can you tell 
me what you're holding in your hand?

184
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,600
Hi, I'm Dr. Tara, and I'm holding 
what's called a typodont, and I use  

185
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,720
it to educate patients so that they know what 
I'm talking about when I'm talking dentistry.

186
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
And can you tell me like the 
names of different teeth? 

187
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,640
Sure. So we have the back 
teeth, which are called molars.

188
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
The teeth between the front teeth and the 
back teeth, which are called premolars.

189
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,000
We have canines.

190
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,200
And then we have central incisors

191
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,240
and laterals just on the outsides.

192
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,360
So right now you're holding 
a toothbrush in your hand.

193
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,560
Can you tell me the best way to brush your teeth?

194
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,640
Some of the best ways is to take the brush and 
go along the gum line at a 45-degree angle.

195
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
You wanna be able to massage the 
teeth and your gums at the same time.

196
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,520
I personally like an electric 
toothbrush better than a manual  

197
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,240
toothbrush because it takes the 
guesswork out of how to brush.

198
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,320
But if you want to use a manual 
toothbrush, you go along the gum lines.

199
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,520
You want to be brushing at least about 
2 minutes, and what that allows you to  

200
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,000
do is to get all the areas of the mouth and be 
really comfortable and get a really good clean.

201
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,040
And then should I brush, floss, 
and then mouthwash, or what's the—?

202
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,000
Everyone always asks this question.

203
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,320
The goal is for you to brush and floss.

204
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,560
Which order you do it in doesn't really matter.

205
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,960
Studies show that you get the exact same result.

206
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,920
I personally floss first and then I brush,  

207
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,960
but I know plenty of people who do the 
opposite and they have great oral hygiene.

208
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,640
Mouthwash is optional.

209
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,440
You definitely can optimize and use mouthwash 
if you want to, but you don't have to.

210
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,120
Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

211
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,240
Hi, I just got my teeth cleaned.
-Hi, awesome.

212
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,880
I can get your scheduled back for 
your treatment with Dr. Pearce,  

213
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,280
and I can also collect your 
payment for today's visit.

214
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,480
Would you like to pay with 
insurance or credit card? 

215
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,240
-With insurance.

216
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,080
I have my insurance card right here.
-Perfect, thank you.

217
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,360
Let me enter that in the system.

218
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,000
Okay, everybody, that's all for today's video.

219
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,120
It's very important to go to the dentist 
because—because today it turned out I  

220
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,360
have three cavities, and I have to 
come back to the dentist in 2 weeks.

221
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,560
I hope you guys enjoyed the video.

222
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,840
Go ahead and give me a like, subscribe, 
and I'll see you guys next week.

223
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:21,640
Bye.
