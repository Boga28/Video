1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,089
Well hey there I'm Emma from mmmEnglish

2
00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,488
and today I am bringing you a very important quiz.

3
00:00:07,488 --> 00:00:11,048
I'm going to test you on some of the most common

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:12,689
English prepositions.

5
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:15,057
At, by and on.

6
00:00:15,397 --> 00:00:19,115
These three prepositions can be easily confused

7
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:24,228
and prepositions in general are really important for us because

8
00:00:24,228 --> 00:00:28,022
they show how elements of a sentence relate to each other

9
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:30,883
so mastering them, feeling confident about them

10
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:34,705
is going to help you to increase your accuracy and ultimately

11
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,441
improve your fluency.

12
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:39,649
And in this lesson, you'll get to test your knowledge of 

13
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:43,878
at, by and on but then I'm going to show you a couple of tricks 

14
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:47,912
and some exceptions that will help you to nail these prepositions

15
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:49,160
every time.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,269
Let's go.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,712
Do you have problems with prepositions?

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,906
Prepositions 8x8 is a step-by-step course for intermediate

19
00:01:03,906 --> 00:01:07,521
to advanced learners to go beyond the basics

20
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:09,680
and to learn eight different ways

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,235
to use eight prepositions in everyday spoken English.

22
00:01:14,235 --> 00:01:17,352
You'll learn some advanced word patterns that are gonna take your

23
00:01:17,352 --> 00:01:20,138
English skills to the next level.

24
00:01:20,138 --> 00:01:24,612
Plus every lesson includes an interactive speaking practice

25
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:28,667
with me using the mmmEnglish imitation technique.

26
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,063
Now, of course, I have a free lesson for you to try

27
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:34,385
so you can see what you think for yourself.

28
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:38,729
Just click the link in the description or follow that one up there

29
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,609
and enroll and try it out for yourself.

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,710
We're actually going to work backwards today. We're going to start

31
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,341
this lesson with a quiz and I think you're actually going to be

32
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:54,737
surprised how many times you can use these prepositions

33
00:01:54,737 --> 00:01:57,966
accurately already. Perhaps you're already making some

34
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:02,347
good choices but there may be a few times when this quiz

35
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:05,971
reveals some opportunities to improve.

36
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:09,235
Once you identify the gaps in your knowledge,

37
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:11,828
well then you can fill them in, can't you?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,902
And that's exactly what today's quiz is all about,

39
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,364
identifying the gaps so that we can fill them in.

40
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:22,643
So I have six questions for you. You're going to see a sentence

41
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:25,939
up on screen with a blank space just like this one.

42
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:29,257
So your job is to decide whether you need to complete that 

43
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:32,594
sentence with at, on or by.

44
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:34,755
So here it's at.

45
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:38,099
The train leaves at 10:27.

46
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:40,248
All right, are you ready to get into it?

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,002
Let's try the first one.

48
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:43,265
Okay take a look.

49
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,741
What do you think?

50
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:50,818
The answer is on.

51
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:53,577
We shop at the market on Saturday.

52
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:57,932
When on is a preposition of time, we use it with days of the week.

53
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:01,164
We say on Monday, on Wednesday etcetera.

54
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:05,657
Or we use it with words that include day.

55
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,979
Christmas Day. We say on holiday

56
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:13,139
and we even use it when we're referring to a specific date.

57
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:19,244
We say on the 3rd of March. We're still referring to a day, right?

58
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:23,009
So that's a good clue, a good general clue to remember.

59
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,276
We use on with days of the week.

60
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:27,559
Next one.

61
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,549
What do you think?

62
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:39,637
Again, the answer is on.

63
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:42,933
So why is there water on the floor?

64
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:47,210
This time on is a preposition of place

65
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,571
and we use it to describe a defined area or a surface.

66
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:53,602
So we say on the balcony.

67
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,209
That's a defined area.

68
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,579
We also say on the table.

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,534
That's a defined surface.

70
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,341
Okay here's the next one.

71
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,608
The answer is at.

72
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:16,281
The party starts at 10 am.

73
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:19,654
10 am? It's a weird time for a party to start.

74
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,520
What about this one?

75
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,262
Yeah, at, again the answer is still at.

76
00:04:32,262 --> 00:04:35,165
I'll meet you at the tram stop.

77
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:40,953
So we use at to describe something precise, a precise time

78
00:04:40,953 --> 00:04:43,963
like 10 o'clock or midday or

79
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,534
at 1:47 or a precise location like we say:

80
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,263
Class is at 255 Queen Street.

81
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:58,676
The school is at the corner of Queen Street and Elizabeth Street.

82
00:04:58,676 --> 00:05:01,326
Or I work at the supermarket.

83
00:05:01,326 --> 00:05:04,178
You get the idea, right? It's precise.

84
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,105
So next we've got this one.

85
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,685
What do you think?

86
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,035
Well the answer is by.

87
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:20,516
Will the report be finished by Friday?

88
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:24,925
So when by is a preposition of time it describes the end,

89
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,832
the end of time.

90
00:05:27,262 --> 00:05:32,080
So we can use it with days, dates and times of the day.

91
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:36,143
The time to write the report ends on Friday.

92
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,585
It's complete, there's no more time after that.

93
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:45,452
So we can say either: The report is due by 12 pm.

94
00:05:45,588 --> 00:05:48,157
The report is due by Friday.

95
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,461
Or the report is due by the 2nd of December.

96
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:55,458
Depending on how specific we want to be.

97
00:05:55,458 --> 00:06:00,983
But did you know that we can replace by in all of these sentences

98
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:05,124
with on or at too. And there are a couple of little things

99
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,423
that we need to pay attention to if we do.

100
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:12,000
Firstly, at can only be used with a time.

101
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,682
The report is due at 2 pm.

102
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:19,316
At tells us that this is a really specific moment,

103
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:24,261
a specific point in time and using by suggests that the report

104
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:30,000
should be finished at any point up until that point in time.

105
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,864
So by and at are similar. At is very specific.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,242
By is giving us the endpoint but what about on?

107
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:46,330
Well firstly, on can only be used with a day or a date.

108
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:49,661
The report is due on Friday.

109
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,921
Or it's due on the 2nd of December.

110
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:56,214
Now there's a tiny little shift that happens here.

111
00:06:56,214 --> 00:07:00,896
As we use on, this sentence becomes more general

112
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:06,420
and more neutral. It's almost just stating a fact, right?

113
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:13,532
It's not really creating urgency around when it must be completed.

114
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,408
Okay? By using at or by it helps to add a little more urgency.

115
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:21,221
That's just a slight tiny little difference.

116
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:24,834
Okay and lucky last. What about this one?

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,898
Well the answer here is by.

118
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:41,615
When by is a preposition of place it means next to or near

119
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:47,012
to something. It relates to closeness or to proximity.

120
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,074
So if we say the umbrella is by the door,

121
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:52,307
it's near to the door.

122
00:07:52,579 --> 00:07:54,664
I live by the beach.

123
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,951
It's near, it's close.

124
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:59,821
The post office is by the library.

125
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:03,929
It means it's next to or near to the library.

126
00:08:04,156 --> 00:08:08,911
Now whether you use at or by here is a little grey.

127
00:08:08,911 --> 00:08:13,011
If you were thinking that the door is a precise location,

128
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:17,236
then you could use at to complete this sentence

129
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:22,865
but probably not when we're talking about objects like an umbrella

130
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:27,358
because at sort of suggests that there's an expectation to come in.

131
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:31,353
So we use it with people or with animals.

132
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:35,488
We say there's someone at the door waiting to come in.

133
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,188
Frankie is waiting at the door. She's scratching at the door.

134
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:41,778
She wants to come in.

135
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:46,000
But if Frankie's just sitting there outside enjoying the sunshine,

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,768
we might say Frankie is by the door.

137
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:55,030
So when we're describing the location of a person or of an animal,

138
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:01,129
we can usually use at and by interchangeably with just a very slight

139
00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:02,503
change in meaning.

140
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:05,641
So how did you go? Did you get all six right?

141
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:09,376
Were there a couple that you weren't sure about? It's okay.

142
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:13,666
Testing yourself and identifying those gaps in your knowledge is

143
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:16,745
exactly what you need to do to keep improving.

144
00:09:16,745 --> 00:09:20,374
Now you know which prepositions you feel really comfortable with

145
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,244
and which ones you might need to practise a little more,

146
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:26,704
maybe give a little more attention to.

147
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:30,179
That is exactly how we make progress together.

148
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,551
But what about when these prepositions don't really fit into those

149
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:37,592
nice neat categories of time and place?

150
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:40,949
Well I want you to keep watching because I'm about to share some

151
00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:46,614
tips that will help you to master at by and on in different situations.

152
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,551
I've got two very important tips that I want to share with you

153
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,676
about learning prepositions.

154
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:56,829
The first tip is to learn prepositions in word patterns.

155
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:00,640
One of the best ways to make sure that you're using prepositions

156
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,392
accurately is to learn them together with the adjectives

157
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:07,013
or the verbs in word patterns.

158
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:11,860
So often in English, a specific type of adjective or noun

159
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,339
will always be followed by the same one or two prepositions

160
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,501
and learning prepositions like this is amazing

161
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:24,034
because you get to learn them in context, in the way that they are

162
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:29,447
actually used in English so it will help you to avoid translating

163
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,850
from your native language which is often a trap that my students

164
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,650
fall into, it leads to using the wrong preposition

165
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,990
because the way that it's used in your native language

166
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,954
may not directly translate to the way that you learn in English

167
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:48,425
and so by learning these word patterns, you're able to

168
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:52,907
think about and understand the preposition as it relates to English

169
00:10:52,907 --> 00:10:57,024
and not directly translate it from your own native language.

170
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:59,703
So let's look at a group of adjectives,

171
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:02,550
adjectives that describe a feeling.

172
00:11:02,844 --> 00:11:04,002
Can you think of any?

173
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,168
Surprised,

174
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,698
delighted,

175
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:09,235
disappointed,

176
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,006
amazed.

177
00:11:11,006 --> 00:11:13,845
I'm sure you can think of many, many more

178
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:19,785
but if I wanted to describe what it was that was making me feel

179
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:25,629
a certain way, angry or upset, then I would use at or by.

180
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,526
I was surprised.

181
00:11:28,568 --> 00:11:29,483
By what?

182
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,694
I was surprised by the news.

183
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,313
I was surprised at the news.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,035
Either is fine.

185
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:39,689
He was amazed by his results.

186
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:42,284
He was amazed at his results.

187
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:47,626
So the point is that just by learning this simple pattern, feeling

188
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,400
and that feeling could be amazed,

189
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,751
delighted,

190
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:54,000
furious, surprised

191
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:57,026
you have the feeling with at or by

192
00:11:57,026 --> 00:12:00,329
and then the cause or the reason.

193
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:04,743
Well if you know that pattern, you can be sure that every time

194
00:12:04,743 --> 00:12:08,924
you want to talk about these feelings and what's causing them

195
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:12,025
well you're going to be using the right preposition.

196
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:17,747
So my second tip is to look for the exceptions and to learn them.

197
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,811
English is full of exceptions, isn't it?

198
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:24,773
It's so annoying but it's true.

199
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,925
We've just learnt that there are lots of groups of verbs or groups of

200
00:12:28,925 --> 00:12:33,335
adjectives that are always followed by the same preposition.

201
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,352
Well if only it were always that simple.

202
00:12:37,352 --> 00:12:41,552
Let's look at the verb arrive just as an example.

203
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:47,746
You arrive at a place, at describes a really precise location

204
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,175
but if you want to talk about how you got there

205
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:54,000
then you would need to use by.

206
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,437
She arrived at the cinema.

207
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,840
But how did she get there? Did she drive?

208
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:04,382
Well then she arrived by car

209
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,521
or maybe she took the train.

210
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,637
She arrived by train.

211
00:13:09,863 --> 00:13:13,135
So at describes the location,

212
00:13:13,135 --> 00:13:17,026
by describes the mode of transportation.

213
00:13:17,026 --> 00:13:19,986
Unless of course, she walked,

214
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:24,588
in which case, we would say on foot.

215
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:27,259
She arrived on foot.

216
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:29,870
So there's the exception.

217
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,421
So this is where paying attention to exceptions can really help.

218
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,091
But now that you know them, you can learn them and you can

219
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:42,709
practise them and the next time you go to use the verb arrive

220
00:13:42,981 --> 00:13:46,017
you can be a hundred percent confident that you're using

221
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:47,520
the right preposition.

222
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,003
Amazing, huh?

223
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,448
So that is all I have for you today but I really hope

224
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:56,688
this lesson got you thinking about prepositions a little differently

225
00:13:56,688 --> 00:14:01,772
and that you feel more confident about using at, on and by now.

226
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:04,993
Make sure you take what you learned today and you put it into

227
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:09,162
practice, spend a few minutes now just as we finish this lesson 

228
00:14:09,162 --> 00:14:12,710
writing some sentences and practising some examples.

229
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,277
