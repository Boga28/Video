00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,170
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,610
Sun on the beach!

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,320
Wait, was that a bad word?

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:15,349
Let's talk about it.

5
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,610
Right now, I'm sitting on the beach.

6
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,020
Oh, look, there's a little crab.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,369
I've heard English learners say "I'm shitting
on the bitch.

8
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,039
Oh, look, there's a little crap".

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,369
Oh no.

10
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:36,929
Of course, with the right context, other people
will be able to understand you, but most people,

11
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:43,139
most English learners, want to avoid using
a rude or bad word by accident.

12
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:49,190
Today we're going to practice several troublesome
or difficult words that often sound like rude

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,129
or bad words.

14
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:56,829
If you are a child, or if you don't like swearing,
you can turn off this lesson.

15
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:01,519
For me, I don't like swearing and I especially
don't like swearing on the internet, but today

16
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:07,710
I'm going to get out of my shell and help
you with these words.

17
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,950
Thanks so much to the awesome pronunciation
app, Elsa Speak, for sponsoring today's lesson

18
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,759
in helping you so that you don't accidentally
say these rude or bad words.

19
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,710
And thanks to Elsa Speak for giving you a
huge, special discount, which I'll tell you

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,539
about at the end of this lesson.

21
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:29,999
To help you remember all of these bad words
and words that sound similar, I've created

22
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:32,700
a free PDF download for you.

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,170
You can click on the link in the description
to download the free PDF for today's lesson

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,450
and never forget how to say these words correctly.

25
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,450
Let's start.

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,149
First, we'll start with some words that you
probably know are difficult for you and that

27
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:47,490
you might be mispronouncing.

28
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,640
And then we'll go on to some words that you
might not know you're saying incorrectly.

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,090
The first pair of tricky words are beach and
bitch.

30
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,810
We have a long E, beach.

31
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,090
And with the bad word, we have short I, bitch.

32
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,750
But I would like to help you practice the
good word.

33
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,848
So here, let's say this sentence together.

34
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:15,709
I love to see the sun on the beach.

35
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,010
Beach.

36
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,420
Notice when I say "E" my lips are wide "E"
and my teeth are almost together.

37
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,420
Beach.

38
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,420
Beach.

39
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,420
Can you say it with me?

40
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,670
I love to see the sun on the beach.

41
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,040
All right, let's go to the next pair.

42
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,599
The next two tricky words have a similar,
difficult sound sheet, sheet and shit.

43
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,760
So here we have a long E and a short I.

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,360
Can you say the sentence with me?

45
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,310
I brought to a sheet to sit on the beach.

46
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,340
I brought a sheet.

47
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,200
My lips are wide and my teeth are almost together.

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,200
Say it with me.

49
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,519
I brought a sheet to sit on the beach.

50
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,599
The next two words also have a similar sound,
piece and piss.

51
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,330
Now, piss isn't exactly an extremely rude
word, but it's not really a word you want

52
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,060
to say out of context.

53
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,400
So let's practice saying piece with a long
E together.

54
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,250
I can't find that piece.

55
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,510
I can't find that piece.

56
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,590
A more commonly used and a little bit less
of a rude phrase that we use in American English

57
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,980
with the word is this, to be pissed off.

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:37,939
So we might say, ugh, I'm so pissed off when
I see trash on the beach.

59
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,500
This means I'm angry and annoyed.

60
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,450
I'm pissed off when I see trash on the beach.

61
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,269
Or we could say he pissed me off when he throws
trash on the beach.

62
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:51,300
Who does that?

63
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,970
There's a trash can, throw it away.

64
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,319
The next three pairs of tricky words have
a short U vowel.

65
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,470
The first pair is can't.

66
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:06,599
And this word is in American English, one
of the worst swear words.

67
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,440
And I don't feel comfortable saying this.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,319
And I definitely don't feel comfortable saying
this on the internet.

69
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,739
So we are going to practice a similar word
that has a similar vowel sound.

70
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:17,579
And that is the word front.

71
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,619
Front.

72
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,320
Look in front of you.

73
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,980
And here, the short U is up and down.

74
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,980
Front.

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,980
Front.

76
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,800
And the regular word is can't.

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,950
Can't.

78
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,380
And our stand-in word front, front.

79
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,950
Let's practice that good word together.

80
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,540
I can't believe what he just said.

81
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,360
I can't believe what he just said.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,250
And just to let you know this word, this bad
word is less bad in other English speaking

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,940
countries, but in the U.S., not a good idea
to say it.

84
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:01,540
The next two pairs of similar words are fork,
and one of the most famous bad words in English,

85
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,540
fuck.

86
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,330
And here, this is going to be that short U
sound.

87
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,050
Up and down.

88
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:14,390
But if you want to say a fork instead, like
a piece of silverware, you can say fork, fork.

89
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,140
Make sure that the R sound is very clear as
well.

90
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,730
Fork, fork.

91
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,330
Let's practice a sentence together.

92
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,870
Do you have a fork?

93
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,200
Do you have a fork?

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,800
Do you have a fork?

95
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,810
Great work.

96
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,910
The next pair is sock, sock and suck.

97
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,910
Suck.

98
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,110
Notice how, when I say that short U, it's
up and down suck.

99
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,920
But if you want to talk about something that's
on your feet, you might say, there's something

100
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,380
in my sock.

101
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,680
There's something in my sock.

102
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,350
And the O is sock, sock.

103
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:55,220
We sometimes use the word suck in a less rude
way, especially if you're talking about it,

104
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,210
literally, you might say, ah, these mosquitoes
won't stop sucking my blood.

105
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,310
These mosquitoes won't stop sucking my blood.

106
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:10,050
Or sometimes we use the word suck in a not
great for professional situations, but any

107
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,120
more casual way, that's less rude to talk
about something that's not good.

108
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,470
We might say that sucks.

109
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,720
That sucks.

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,220
You might use this in a situation where you
forgot something when you went on vacation.

111
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,940
So here I am at the beach and if you forgot
your swimsuit, not a good idea, but if you

112
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,470
forget your swimsuit, your family member might
say to you, ah, that sucks.

113
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,150
You're going to have to buy a new one.

114
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,310
That sucks.

115
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,310
It's a bummer.

116
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,150
Next, we have some pairs of words that are
tricky consonants.

117
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,380
Tricky, consonants.

118
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,410
I already said one of these today.

119
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,630
They are crab and crap.

120
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,160
Crab and crap.

121
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,090
So let's practice saying the B at the end
of this word correctly.

122
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:56,620
Oh, a crab pinched me.

123
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,530
A crab pinched me.

124
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,650
Make sure that there is a clear B sound here.

125
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,110
A crab pinched me.

126
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,220
We do sometimes use the word crap in a less
rude way.

127
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,710
So I'd like to teach you that as well.

128
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,710
Sometimes I say this.

129
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,150
This is my one of my favorite euphemisms I
often use in daily life.

130
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,830
Instead of a bad word, I might say, you scared
the crap out of me.

131
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,190
You scared the crap out of me.

132
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,000
What do you think you're doing, scaring me
in the middle of the night.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,120
You scared the crap out of me.

134
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,150
And this is kind of a silly phrase to give
some emphasis to your words.

135
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:38,990
Or if you happen to stub your toe, you could
say a bad word, or you could say, oh crap.

136
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,990
Maybe if you forget something at the beach,
like your swimsuit, you might say, oh crap,

137
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,460
I forgot my swimsuit.

138
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
Okay?

139
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:50,140
You don't want to say this to your boss, but
it's not too rude to say with people you're

140
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,590
comfortable with.

141
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,530
Next is ask and ass.

142
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,990
You want to make sure that you have a clear
K sound at the end.

143
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,280
Can I ask you a question?

144
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,400
Can I ask you a question?

145
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,840
Can I ask you a question?

146
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,580
If you drop the S yes, people will understand
the general context, but it is much better

147
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,800
to add K at the end to be super clear.

148
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,460
Can I ask you a question?

149
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,590
Our final pair of tricky words are damp and
damn.

150
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,860
Damp and damn.

151
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,010
Make sure that you say a clear P sound at
the end of this word.

152
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,010
Ugh.

153
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,399
I dropped my towel in the water and now it's
damp, it's damp.

154
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,000
This means it's a little bit wet.

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,529
Maybe if you try to dry your swimsuit outside
overnight so that it dries, but it doesn't

156
00:08:42,529 --> 00:08:43,620
completely dry.

157
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,529
You might say, oh man, my swimsuit is still
damp.

158
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:48,670
My swimsuit is still damp.

159
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,459
I guess I got to wear it anyway.

160
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:54,529
And if you were to use the bad word, you might
say, damn, now I don't have a dry swimsuit.

161
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:58,870
But this is a little bit stronger than some
of the other bad words that I mentioned, like

162
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,420
crap or piss.

163
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,220
So maybe avoid it in more formal situations.

164
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:10,089
So how did you do, were you able to hear the
difference between these pairs of tricky words?

165
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:15,490
It's very important to hear the difference,
but it's even more important to them correctly

166
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,930
and to be able to say them differently.

167
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,699
I have some good news.

168
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:25,589
The awesome app, Elsa Speak, can help you
to say exactly what you want to say without

169
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:28,850
accidentally saying a rude or bad word.

170
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,259
When you speak in English, you will get an
exact score for all of the different sounds

171
00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:35,259
that you've said in English.

172
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:38,480
And you'll get specific advice about how you
can improve.

173
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,240
Let's take a look at what 13 million users
are talking about.

174
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,279
Elsa Speak:
This is good.

175
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,120
Vincenzo:
This is good.

176
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,120
85.

177
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,250
Vanessa:
Okay.

178
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,950
What did it say you needed to practice on
that one?

179
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:01,790
Vincenzo:
Yeah, he says that my TH was my, this was

180
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,920
actually a D and I have to-
Elsa Speak:

181
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:14,000
If you don't stick your tongue out, it might
sound like D, or Z.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,389
Vanessa:
Yeah.

183
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:21,180
Would you like to try it one more time with
that clear "th" sound because I know you can

184
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,180
do it.

185
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,480
It's just 100% of the time trying to do that.

186
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,990
So let's try it one more time.

187
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,990
Vincenzo:
Yeah.

188
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:27,990
Yeah.

189
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,990
Of course.

190
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:29,990
Elsa Speak:
This is good.

191
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,519
Vincenzo:
This is good.

192
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,759
Perfect.

193
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,379
Vanessa:
Just like you saw with Vincenzo, you can practice

194
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:46,860
with over 1,600 lessons over 40 different
topics and you can practice the tricky consonants

195
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,600
and vowels that we talked about in this lesson
in the skills section of the app.

196
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,829
For English learners, Elsa Speak, is by far
the best pronunciation app.

197
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,319
Just look at this, pretty great right.

Before we go, let's practice one fun challenge
sentence.

203
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,610
And before the ocean sweeps me away, let's
practice one fun challenge sentence together

204
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,710
using some of these tricky sounds that we
practiced.

205
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:33,690
If I can't go to the beach, maybe I can eat
a piece of cake with a fork.

206
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,740
All right, let's practice that sentence one
more time.

207
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:45,670
If I can't go to the beach, maybe I can eat
a piece of cake with a fork.

208
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,720
Great work.

212
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,899
And now I have a question for you.

213
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,670
Let me know in the comments, what do you like
to do when you go to the beach?

214
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,670
Let me know.

215
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,110
