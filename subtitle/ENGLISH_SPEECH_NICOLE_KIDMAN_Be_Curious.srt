1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:15,230
Krista Smith:
Over 70 performances you've had, of characters

2
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,630
that you've played to me when I look at some
of this stuff, and obviously, this year you

3
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,930
have two films, Boy Erased and Destroyer,
which you guys are lucky enough to be going

4
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,890
to see after we finish chatting.

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:31,580
But it seems like your work is only getting
better and more interesting as you go along

6
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,720
in your career.

7
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,630
Do you look at things differently now than
you did, let's say when you were just starting

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,780
out and we first met you when you came, it
was dead calm, I think.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,290
And then you went into Days of Thunder and
you kind of started your path here in America

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,310
with that?

11
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,910
Nicole Kidman:
I started actually at 14 in a film called

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,540
Bush Christmas.

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:59,030
And I got to get out of school for six weeks.

14
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:05,399
And, but I think my whole journey has always
been trying to find characters.

15
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:10,289
And as an actor, you're very much, you're
not in the driver's seat.

16
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:13,850
I mean, you need a director to choose you.

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,799
You audition a lot, particularly when you're
young, it's like, that's what you do.

18
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,509
And sometimes you get the role and sometimes
you don't.

19
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:32,850
And I think you just have to have a passion
and sort of view it as a long term because

20
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,240
for me it was always the journey.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,520
I wanted to go and explore the world.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,920
I wanted to explore the human psyche.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
I wanted to live a well-examined life.

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,799
And by doing what I do and being given the
chance to be able to act, it's taken me on

25
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,020
this extraordinary road and I've worked with
the greatest directors in the world, I've

26
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,310
been around the greatest minds.

27
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:04,039
I've been the recipient of some of the greatest
writers and their words.

28
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:10,380
So, it's an amazing place to be, but I never
would've thought that it was going to be like

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,380
this.

30
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,850
I dreamed big, but not like this.

31
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,230
Krista Smith:
And how do you sustain that passion and curiosity

32
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:24,230
and energy to take on what you do because
you do give a hundred percent at every single

33
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,210
performance, whether it is a supporting or
the lead?

34
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,810
Nicole Kidman:
I mean, it ebbs and flows and that's the truth

35
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,810
of it.

36
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,270
There's times when you go, I just don't have
anything left to give.

37
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:40,640
And there's been times when I've gone, okay,
I'm now drained.

38
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,030
I don't know where I'm at in my life.

39
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:50,550
I've got to go and find, and I always say,
you know, you have to have the life to then

40
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,670
be able to go and put it into your art.

41
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,690
And I've had a crazy life.

42
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:07,390
I just have, and I've also had, I'm a highly
sensitive person and I also attach very strongly

43
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,460
to people.

44
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,010
And so, with that comes all of the emotions
that are attached to that.

45
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,990
And that then gives me the well to draw from.

46
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,820
But I'm also just, I'm still very curious.

47
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:29,140
I'm still, I still have this passion for the
work and for being on the set, and that time

48
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,820
between action and cut, it is still extraordinary
to me.

49
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:40,370
And sometimes it falls and you just go, I'm
never, ever going to be any good ever again.

50
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:45,350
And then something happens and it ignites
and you're off.

51
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,210
And I love it and I still love it to this
day.

52
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,510
Krista Smith:
Now you've said before that Moulin Rouge is

53
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,350
the film that if you see it on TV, you have
to watch it.

54
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:00,960
Perhaps, I don't want to say one of your favourite
films, but how important was that moment and

55
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,410
that character, what you did in Moulin Rouge
with Baz and playing Satine?

56
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,000
Nicole Kidman:
I mean, I grew up in a family where musicals

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,910
were considered the best that, that was what
you wanted to do.

58
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,918
My family, we would stand around the piano.

59
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,938
We would sing.

60
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:22,180
That was, but I don't have a great voice.

61
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,479
I have a medium voice, but I don't have a
voice that could sustain a Broadway show,

62
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,600
eight shows a week for, you know, years.

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,349
But suddenly Moulin Rouge came along and it
was like, oh my gosh, I get to sing and dance

64
00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:38,759
and act, which is what they used to do.

65
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,210
I mean, the great actresses all could do all
of those things.

66
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,990
So, it was kind of like being given this opportunity.

67
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:55,599
Then of course I freaked out and went I can't
do it, and Baz kind of had to push me into

68
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,599
it.

69
00:04:56,599 --> 00:04:57,599
And he's such a showman, Baz.

70
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:04,479
I mean, he just, so he almost willed that
performance and that out of me.

71
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,400
And I'd always said, I wanted to make a love
story as much as I make so many dark films.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,370
And I explore all the territories that are,
you know, I like going into places that are

73
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,370
considered uncomfortable and dangerous.

74
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,409
I also love, love.

75
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:23,719
And I just had never been in a great love
story.

76
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:28,169
And I see Moulin Rouge is a love story and
I love being a part of that and putting that

77
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:29,169
in the world.

78
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:30,300
Krista Smith:
That was one of the great love stories.

79
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,069
It was so great to see the little bits of
it here.

80
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:39,289
And speaking of those dark characters, obviously,
Destroyer is, what struck me about this film

81
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:44,060
was first off, you're unrecognizable in it
from when you see it on the poster.

82
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:51,090
The just physical transformation that you
did, obviously in makeup and hair and that.

83
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,310
But it was your whole walk and your body and
your voice.

84
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,210
You almost changed from the inside out.

85
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:02,000
Nicole Kidman:
I mean, that's what you do as an actor.

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,960
I don't like focusing on the hair and the
makeup and all of those things, because I

87
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,470
still believe in the mystery of the performance.

88
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,419
And there's such a desire now for people to
tell you everything and dissect everything

89
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:16,569
and give you.

90
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:18,419
But there's magic involved.

91
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:24,080
And I love keeping that magic too so that
then people just watch the film.

92
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,300
I mean, I have to say this year, I got given,
well, it was last year, but they've seemed

93
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,180
to have come out within a couple of months
of each other.

94
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,990
But Boy Erased and Destroyer, to have both
those characters in the same year is amazing

95
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,870
at this time of my life.

96
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:50,189
And they're both really extreme and you're
not seeing Boy Erased tonight, but by talking

97
00:06:50,189 --> 00:06:56,389
about the two, one of them is they're both
mothers, they're both on a path trying to

98
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,710
heal what they've done to their children.

99
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,509
And I find that really powerful and emotional.

100
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:13,440
And I love that they're so different, but
strangely enough, they're on the same path.

101
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,669
And that was really, really interesting to
me.

102
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:21,069
And I actually did Boy Erased, I had four
weeks off, and then I went straight into Destroyer.

103
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,069
And then I collapsed.

104
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:23,069
Krista Smith:
Yeah.

105
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,279
I was going to say because it's a very physical
performance and it's also very masculine,

106
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,279
but yet so deeply feminine.

107
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,370
Nicole Kidman:
Well, I would say it's deeply female.

108
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,419
Krista Smith:
Yeah, it is.

109
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,259
Nicole Kidman:
Which is a weird thing to say, but I do see

110
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,909
it as deeply female because her motivations
are female.

111
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:43,889
I mean, you haven't seen the movie yet, but
there's a moment when, and only a woman gets

112
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,940
to experience this when she finds out she's
pregnant and it's a flash.

113
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:57,099
She's high, she's doing cocaine and that is
devastating for her.

114
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:00,340
That's the beginning of her relationship with
her child.

115
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,159
So, that's a female situation for her.

116
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:09,770
That is, and it's so complicated and devastating.

117
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,939
It leads her on this very, very destructive
path.

118
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:18,350
But she's maternal and she's operating from
a maternal force.

119
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:24,240
It may have been a maternal force that has
made massive mistakes, has not been there,

120
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,060
and has not been what we call a good mother.

121
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:34,360
But she's a mother and the basis for so much
of her motivations and her drive is from that.

122
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,019
And her shame and her pain.

123
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:44,540
Thank you for having us.

124
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:59,660
Krista Smith:
Thank you.

125
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:10,990
Enjoy the film.
