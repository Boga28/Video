1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,070
I know what you mean; that does look
good. Oh, hi. James from engVid. E and I

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:11,370
were just discussing: "That looks pretty
healthy." And today, I'm going to talk

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,800
about collocations for health or a
healthy diet. Let me explain quickly

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,990
what that means so we can go to the
board. Collocation — "c-o" means "with"

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,120
or "together", and "location" — come
together — "location" is a place. So,

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,980
"collocation" means words that are
usually situated together; they come

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,410
together. Right? So, if you see one, you
will probably see the other word. So,

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,100
I'm going to give you five collocations
about a healthy diet.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,580
Let us not confuse "diet". A lot of
people think "diet", like the keto diet,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,550
or the vegetarian diet. "Diet"
originally means — and I mean it here —

11
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:58,940
it is a.  the regular foods that you
eat; that is your diet. It's not cutting

12
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,500
down calories, so I'm not talking about
not eating to get nice, and skinny, and

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,390
slim. I'm just saying: "What do you
usually eat?" For instance, cats have a

14
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,650
"carnivore diet" — they eat mostly meat;
that's their diet. They're not trying to

15
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:18,110
get skinny for summer season. Right? So,
that's what I'm talking about a "healthy

16
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,420
diet": What do you usually eat? So,
let's go to the board and take a look at

17
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,500
this healthy diet.

18
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,400
Look at this. Interesting. Very
interesting. Let's start off with: What

19
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,750
does it mean to have a healthy diet?
Well, I think a "healthy diet" is a

20
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:41,160
"balanced diet". And what does that
mean? Generally put, without — and I

21
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,620
don't mean any insult — extremes, if
you're a "carnivore diet", it means

22
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,780
mostly meat all the time; and if you are
a "vegan", it means no animal products

23
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,000
whatsoever. Right? Those are, I would
say, on the ends of it. The "balanced

24
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,280
diet" would be in between, where for the
average person, because let's face it,

25
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,290
I'm in North America — you may be in
Saudi Arabia, you may be in Asia, you

26
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,650
may be in Russia — the foods that are
available to you are going to be

27
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:13,200
different than when they are available
everywhere else.

28
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,220
So, a "balanced diet" is keeping fruits;
vegetables; carbohydrates, like potatoes

29
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,320
and rice; and balanced with protein,
whatever that may be — cheese, it could

30
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,200
be fish or meat. Okay? So, a "balanced
diet" is having a healthy balance that's

31
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,460
not too much of one, so not too many
fruits and vegetables only. And that

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,450
would be, like, "vegan" for most people.
Right? Or having only meat, and that

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,810
would be for a "carnivore diet" for
other people. So, we're saying keeping a

34
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,590
healthy balance; making sure you have a
bit of everything, because our bodies

35
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,020
require certain nutrients — right? — and
we can get them most efficiently and

36
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,700
easily from different sources. Okay, so
now I've said that. That's what your

37
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,570
"balanced diet" is.

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:02,340
And what E and I noticed is that we have
"protein" in the form of fish, and we

39
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,480
have "carbohydrates" — because, yes,
vegetables have carbohydrates, or

40
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,530
commonly called in North America
"carbs". You will not see many people

41
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,310
talk about the "carbohydrates" in these
foods; they talk about "carbs". That is

42
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,840
your energy. Actually, "protein" and
"carbs" can both be used for energy in

43
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,360
different ways, but "carbs", they mean
not meat sources. Okay? So, keep in mind

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,130
that "carbs" can be vegetables, but they
can also be starches, which would be

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,930
rice and potatoes. I don't have rice or
potatoes here, but it is balanced. Half

46
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:39,870
the plate is protein; half the plate is
carbs. And the collocation here is: a

47
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,040
"balanced diet". So, if you say: "I have
a balanced diet", people know you have

48
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,140
equal carbs, equal protein.

49
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:52,830
Now, let's talk about.  Well, we know
animals live all year long. You know?

50
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,740
Humans don't live from — some humans
seem to — May; and then in November,

51
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,680
they disappear. It's like: "Where did
the humans go?" They all died, but they

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,180
come back in May. Animals tend to live
all year long, so we don't talk about

53
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,780
"seasonal animals". You're not going to
hear someone go: "The seasonal animal,

54
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,930
this" — no. Bears may sleep, but they
still live. Bees go to sleep; some go to

55
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,790
sleep, but they still live. But some of
our fruits and vegetables, they die. In

56
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,140
the winter in Canada and United States,
it's too cold for apples to be on trees;

57
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,260
they just die, and they come back in
May. But depending on where you live in

58
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:36,810
the world, at different seasons,
different foods are naturally available

59
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,400
to you. So, this collocation list I'm
giving you is not about just being

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,270
healthy for yourself, but you might say
it's also healthy for your environment.

61
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,860
Many scientists and people noticed that
seasonal fruits actually are better for

62
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,430
you because they're ready to eat now;
they're not frozen, and they don't add

63
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,570
salt and make them wait, you know, so
you can eat them six months later. So,

64
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,900
getting them in the season means they
have maximum nutrition, which is good

65
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,070
for you. So, "seasonal fruits and
vegetables" are good things to have.

66
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay?

67
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,140
What's the best way of doing that? So,
this is one collocation: "seasonal

68
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,640
fruit" or "seasonal vegetable". The best
way to get "seasonal fruits" or

69
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,160
"seasonal vegetables" is.  Guess what?
They have to be "locally sourced".

70
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,050
There's your fourth collocation.
"Locally sourced" means it grows in the

71
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,610
area that you live. I am very, very
lucky and fortunate. And I know this,

72
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,280
because I live in North America, and I
can get a pineapple in December. I can

73
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,380
get watermelon in December. I can have
starfish or starfruit in December. In

74
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,460
the countries these places come from,
they have them that season, and no more.

75
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,260
But we have everything brought to us; we
don't have everything locally sourced.

76
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:56,010
So, if you're very lucky, and you can
have grapes, milk, chicken, and pears,

77
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,520
and apples and they're all grown around
you — that's the best way to get your

78
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,200
food. See on my fish? My fish comes from
Lake Ontario. If you see the eyes —

79
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,610
yeah, that water is poisonous. I don't
think this is a good fish to eat, but

80
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,580
it's locally sourced. I found it in Lake
Ontario, and it's dead for sure. So, as

81
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,910
we're going through, we want to have a
balanced diet. Okay? We want it made up

82
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,540
of seasonal fruits and vegetables. We
really want it locally sourced; in your

83
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,700
area. So, if you're at Italy, eat
Italian grapes, get Italian cheese. Oh,

84
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,000
God, Italian food; I'm so hungry now.
Anyway, I'm sorry, back to the work.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,860
Yes, so.  now, what do we call these
green things? Because the tomatoes,

86
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:39,570
which are interesting — they're a fruit
not a vegetable. Please, please go on

87
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,000
the internet right now because I know
some of you are like: "He doesn't know

88
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,260
what he's talking about." Please check
it out. "Seed-bearing fruit". Tomatoes

89
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,340
have seeds. Told you. So, a cucumber
is.  "What!?" I'm blowing your mind.

90
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,820
Extra information. So, anyway, "leafy
greens" are like spinach — I love

91
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:01,200
arugula — arugula. Everybody's like:
"James is very snobby; he likes arugula,

92
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,130
not lettuce." Love arugula. Spinach,
arugula, collard greens, heads of

93
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:12,090
lettuce, just normal lettuce — these are
called "leafy greens". We usually use

94
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,130
them as salads, on your hamburgers. Hmm?
Yeah, on your hamburgers, too. Okay.

95
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,540
These are "leafy greens" — they are good
for helping with digestion. Okay? So,

96
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,650
you want to have those with your salads
or whatever you want to cook it with,

97
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,050
because collard greens are pretty good
by themselves.

98
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,970
And another thing about a healthy diet
is you want it "freshly prepared".

99
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,070
McDonald's says it's freshly prepared,
but what they mean is: "Made six months

100
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:46,530
ago, brought to the McDonald's close to
you. Cooked — put in the microwave for

101
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,300
another three minutes", and it's freshly
given to you. "Freshly prepared" means

102
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,010
literally you go out, cut that tomato
down. Well, not exactly, but close

103
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,480
enough. Cut it down, cut it up, put it
on your plate — "freshly prepared". Or

104
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,500
when you're cooking.  I don't cook
until you come. You come to my house,

105
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,460
you sit down, and say: "I'm hungry." I
go: "Okay, now I cook." I make it there

106
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,090
when you're there. I don't go in the
freezer, defrost it, and microwave it.

107
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,320
Cool?

108
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,360
So, now I've given you five collocations
for a very healthy lifestyle, and it

109
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,930
will show your depth of English
knowledge when you say.  God, if you

110
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:27,660
came to, with this.  Here's my fake
world accent: "So, I would like to have

111
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,380
some food. Yeah. And it must be freshly
prepared. You know? I like

112
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,630
freshly-prepared foods, yes. Locally
sourced. I hear Ontario has very good

113
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,430
food. Yeah?" They'd be like: -"Bravo.
That's absolutely brilliant. Yes,

114
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,950
locally sourced. And you know that
Ontario has great seasonal fruits and

115
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,990
vegetables. Don't try the fish, of
course." They'd be impressed, even if

116
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:58,290
you have a strong accent because that is
a very excellent use of the English

117
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,220
language. It's very specific, and it
shows you understand; not just in your

118
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,870
own language, but in ours. We usually
call that "intelligence". So, I've gone

119
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:10,860
through my collocations for you. Why
don't we go through a test to see if

120
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,370
you've learned them? And see if you can
master the language and sound like an

121
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,950
expert traveller English. (snaps)

122
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,630
Okay, so I'm about to ask you something
very important. Something I've never

123
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,890
asked you to do before, and that's to
make a promise. But I'm not going to say

124
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,320
"promise"; that's not strong enough. I
need a vow. A "vow" is a very strong

125
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:39,180
promise. If you vow to do something, you
must do it. Imagine you had a sword and

126
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,760
there was a village behind you, and
you're the only one with a sword and the

127
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,620
dragon's coming — and you vow to protect
them. That means to every little girl

128
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,980
and boy crying, behind you, like: "I vow
to protect you!" It's: "I will die

129
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,240
before I break this promise". In the
modern age, a vow is so strong that we

130
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,620
make people get married to it. You vow
to stay with this person till death. And

131
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,380
if you don't, they take half your stuff.
That's serious. Forget the sword. Half

132
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,160
your stuff.

133
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,590
Okay, so I want you to make a vow — now
you're like: "No, James! No!" —about

134
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,180
leading a healthy lifestyle. But before
you do, I just want to tell you I made a

135
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:21,870
mistake. I made a mistake. I'm sorry. I
am for real. I forgot to say: "lean

136
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:27,540
meat". "Lean meat". What is "lean meat"?
"Lean meat" is food, or actually it's

137
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,620
animal meat that doesn't have a lot of
fat. The example I can give you is

138
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,610
chicken. A chicken breast, which is the
breast of the chicken, is usually called

139
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,450
"white meat" and it has very little fat
on it. In fact, it's.  doesn't cook as

140
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,530
well because there's not enough fat to
absorb the flavour. It's good for you,

141
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:48,330
but it's not as flavourful as a leg or a
thigh, which has more fat to absorb

142
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,860
seasoning. That's why in a lot of
indigenous foods, or a lot of native

143
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,360
foods through certain areas, they will
use leg meat more than breast meat

144
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,730
because it gets more flavour. Okay? But
flavour comes fat. So, to be healthy,

145
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,930
you want to eat leaner meat.

146
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,710
Now, you'll see I have: "fish" and a
question mark. Well, remember I said:

147
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,660
"chicken"? What? So, "lean meat" is
usually considered parts of meat that

148
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,830
doesn't have a lot of fat; and they
usually talk about chicken, beef, and

149
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:24,060
pork. I am going to raise the argument
that fish is a lean meat. Why? Well,

150
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,920
it's an animal like the other ones and
it bleeds like the other ones; and just

151
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,950
like the other ones, when it's alive
it's an animal, when it's dead it's. 

152
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,880
you say: "fish". And I go: "It's a type
of meat", just like we're meat when we

153
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,950
die. Believe it or not, you're just
meat. So, my idea: Fish is lean meat.

154
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,670
Now, because you will run into people
who are native speakers and they'll hear

155
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:48,060
you say: "Fish is lean meat", some of
them will go: "No, it's fish. Fish is

156
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,630
fish; meat is meat." They can make that
distinction. In your head, you can go:

157
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:57,720
"Yeah, stupid. Yes, you're correct. But
I know the truth." So, fish can be

158
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,260
considered a type of lean meat in my
little definition, but go by the strict

159
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,320
one when you talk to native speakers and
whatnot. Okay?

160
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,730
Now, let's go to the board and continue
with our vow. So, now you're going to

161
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:14,490
make a vow for not only learning English
with me or learning English, but to lead

162
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:20,550
a healthy lifestyle. So, here I want you
to put your name. So: "I", let's say:

163
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,440
"I, Bobby", "I, Anna", "I", whatever,
"will lead a healthy lifestyle to keep

164
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,210
both myself and the planet healthy".
Because you are a good person and you

165
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,600
want to do what's right. So, that,
you're going to do that. Let's look at

166
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,850
the collocations we learned and how they
can best fit into the rest of our vow,

167
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,180
so we can keep our promise. We have to
know what the promise is.

168
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:52,260
So, next sentence is: "Therefore, I will
only eat __________ food." That's: "food

169
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,310
close to me". Now, that doesn't mean: Go
in your refrigerator and grab a beer,

170
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,180
and some chicken wings. That's close to
you, but that's not what we mean. What

171
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:09,240
do I mean? That's right, local food.
"Locally-sourced". So, go to your local

172
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:17,010
farmer and ask them: "Do they have eggs?
Cheeses? Lean meat?" and they probably

173
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,860
won't have fish, but that's okay. But
you can get lean chicken. All right?

174
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,160
"Locally-sourced foods" — things you can
find close to you. In Italy, they have

175
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,890
some of the best grapes, wines, cheeses,
pastas — they don't need to go nowhere

176
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:32,280
else; it's paradise there. Great food. I
love it there. Anyway.

177
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,850
Next. What's the next one? "I won't eat
a lot of meat, but if I do, it will be

178
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,570
__________" — not having much fat on it.
No, not Mr. E. Okay? You can't eat Mr.

179
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,630
E. He needs to come.  he works for a
living; he's got to be on the board.

180
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,890
What did I just say? "lean meat", right?
Because it doesn't have a lot of fat, so

181
00:13:52,890 --> 00:14:00,270
it's better for your heart. What about
this one? "I will eat a lot of

182
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:07,740
__________ at lunch and dinner." Now,
I've put "salad" to help you out. "leafy

183
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:20,130
vegetables". When we talk about leafy
vegetables, we talk about spinach. Ah,

184
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,440
sorry. I'm jumping ahead of myself. I
don't mean "leafy vegetables". You're

185
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,830
going to go: "No, James, that's not. "
Shh. Don't tell anybody yet. "leafy

186
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:35,850
greens", because they are green — like
spinach, romaine, romaine lettuce,

187
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:39,990
spinach, lettuce, or arugula, which I
love. I'm looking and thinking about all

188
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:44,220
of these things, but "leafy greens". And
those are usually in your salads. When

189
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,030
you have a Caesar salad, or a
Mediterranean salad — they're leafy

190
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,570
greens.

191
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:55,860
Now, what about this one? "I will only
eat __________" something. And this is

192
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,840
important for helping the planet because
when you get things brought in at

193
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,050
different times of the year, when you
shouldn't have them, we have to use

194
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,950
ships and airplanes, and that pollutes
the planet, so.  Oh my gosh, I sound

195
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:14,220
like a tree-hugger. I'm not. Trust me.
But what do we do? We're going to eat

196
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:24,420
something in the season, so "seasonal
fruits and vegetables". Right? So, in

197
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,680
Canada, we really shouldn't be having
pineapple in January. We've got that

198
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,410
much snow. When I say: "that much" — I'm
not the tallest guy in the world, I'm

199
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,740
not that tall, but the snow comes up to
here. There is no room for pineapples.

200
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,780
Okay? You got to go to the Bahamas, man.
Anyway, but we get it in January,

201
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,950
because that's where we live.

202
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,980
Now, finally: "I will eat a __________"
something.  And I told you when you have

203
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,650
something that's, you know, like weights
— the scales of justice — they must be

204
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:04,260
balanced. A "balanced diet". And
remember what I mean "diet" here, I

205
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:08,340
don't mean; You're going to try and lose
10 pounds before the prom to fit into

206
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:11,700
your nice dress, or you want to look
good on the beach. I'm talking about

207
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:15,480
your regular foods. So, what you eat for
breakfast, lunch, dinner, all year long

208
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,710
for the last 10 years is your "natural
diet". Hope you did well on the quiz.

209
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,520
You know, we have a better, bigger,
badder, better one at engVid, but before

210
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,650
I get to that, let's give you your
bonus.

211
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,120
We talked about the good; now we're
going to talk about the bad and the

212
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,200
ugly. Because when you're not doing this
and using these collocations to talk

213
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,600
about a healthy lifestyle, you may be
using these other ones. Okay? Now,

214
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:44,610
"processed foods". This is a really
interesting one, because people at

215
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,350
McDonald's might say their food's not
that processed. I say they're lying. But

216
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,570
they might say: "No, no, it's actual
100% beef." Now, here's the key, because

217
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,510
this is from the Food and Drug
Administration from the United States of

218
00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:03,150
America, and what they say is this —
this is paraphrased, but basically: "Any

219
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,720
food that has a process applied to
change its natural state is called

220
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,880
'processed'." So, even if the beef is
from a cow, that's not its natural

221
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,480
state.

222
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,270
Have you ever seen a cow burger? You
know, it's got, like, ground beef. It

223
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,800
goes: "Woo." It doesn't go: "Moo",
because it's cut up. "Woo". And you just

224
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,690
take pieces off and eat it? No. You have
to take that meat, and then do something

225
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,140
with it. And sometimes you add a little
salt, some pepper, some — "num, num,

226
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,480
num, num, num, num" — secret ingredients
that we don't know. You know, things to

227
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,260
keep it stay longer and fresher. You
know what I'm saying? So, that's not its

228
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,740
natural state anymore; that's called a
"processed food". So, if you take an

229
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,570
apple, you might say: "Well, James, I'm
smart. They wash the apples." Does it

230
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,680
look like it came off the tree? Yes.
That's its natural state. That's not it.

231
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,860
Applesauce — processed food; apple juice
— processed food. Apple that's been

232
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,300
cleaned — you lucky bastard; someone
cleaned it for you. It's its natural

233
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:04,980
state. Okay? Now, that is anything
that's packaged, usually packaged

234
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,640
because they cut it up and do something
with it. That's not just its natural

235
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,410
state. So, think of hamburger versus
steak, think of applesauces versus an

236
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,130
apple, and you can follow it from there.
When they change it from.  you can look

237
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,870
at it and say: "I know what this food
was before I took it." Okay? If you

238
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:24,630
don't.  if you can't recognize it, then
it's a processed food.

239
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,940
Next: "fatty food". Do you remember we
talked about "lean meat", and that's why

240
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,120
I had to talk about this one? "Fatty
foods" aren't good for your heart,

241
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,160
because they contain a lot of extra fat
that your body cannot process. So, if

242
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,170
you eat a lot of fattening foods —
sausages.  My heart's: "Bl, bl, th,

243
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:48,630
th". You know, lots of cheesy pizza.
"Bl, bl, th, th". Come on, come on,

244
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,290
baby. Come on. Come on! Come on! That's
not good for you. So, if you say: "My

245
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,530
diet is high in fatty foods and
processed foods", you're probably going

246
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,700
to see the doctor and the undertaker —
I'm not talking the wrestler — sooner

247
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,790
than you would like. All right? So, you
want to eliminate those.

248
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:10,050
Now, for the homework. I got to separate
this here. Okay. Homework is this. This

249
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,790
is for your own good. So, you're only
going to get five points each. Yup. So,

250
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,890
when it's good, you get nothing. Okay?
This one's a joke. So, in case you don't

251
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,940
know, I'm telling a joke here before you
start telling people. But if you get it

252
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,590
that actually.  If you get the joke and
you put: "hahaha" because you get it —

253
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,520
you don't get five points; you get a
million points. If you just write the

254
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,340
answer, and you don't find out why it's
funny — stay with five because you got

255
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,090
no sense of humour.

256
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,120
So, the first one is: "The fish is
__________; I stole it from my friend's

257
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,370
dinner plate." It's funny. You get it?
It's right there. It's right there.

258
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:53,960
Whatever. Okay. Question number two: "I
eat a __________ with a mix of lean meat

259
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:59,180
and seasonal vegetables." Cool? Well,
that's what I got for you today. I hope

260
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,690
you keep your vow, because that means
you will stay around longer so we can

261
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,190
work together, or I can keep my vow to
help you learn English. Okay?

262
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,280
So, I'm going to get going. But before I
go, please make sure you stop by www

263
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,930
"eng" as in English, "vid" as in
video.com, to get the larger quiz to

264
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,250
this. And also, I've been saying it
recently, and I think I'll keep saying

265
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,510
it, because I think it's true: If you're
still listening to my voice now, you

266
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,230
like this video, because there's nothing
more and you're still waiting for

267
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:35,230
something, so press "Like" please. And
outside of that, if you've been watching

268
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:39,610
this, and it's like your third, fourth,
fifth video — subscribe, because I think

269
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:43,810
you want what I have to offer. And the
most efficient way to get it to you is

270
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:47,770
to subscribe, press the bell, and you'll
be notified the next time one of my

271
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,950
videos comes out. So, you won't be one
of those people, because I see it all

272
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:55,150
the time: "Teacher, where have you been?
We don't see you", and I'm like: "I come

273
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,910
out. You don't look till three months
later. But it's there." Don't be one of

274
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,420
those people; hit the bell. Anyway, I
gotta get going. You have a great day

275
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:09,460
and I will talk to you soon.
Locally-sourcing my dinner tonight; I'm

276
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,500
going to order some pizza. (laughs) I'm
so funny. No, you're not. No, you're

277
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:14,740
not.
