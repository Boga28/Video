1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,480
Saying thank you is a common
way to express gratitude or show

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:08,960
appreciation when someone does
something nice for you. But gratitude,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,640
the practice of gratitude,

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:14,800
is so much more than saying thank you.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,800
I'm sure that you've read blog posts or
listened to podcasts on the importance

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,710
of creating a gratitude practice
or maybe even having a gratitude

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,630
journal. In fact, inside my
Confident Women Community ,

8
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:33,550
this has become a hot
topic of conversation with

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,990
regular discussions and exchanges on
how to best implement a practice of

10
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,580
gratitude. So as you begin
to reflect on the past year,

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,740
how can you best express
your gratitude in English?

12
00:00:48,741 --> 00:00:52,940
How can you go beyond a simple,
thank you. If you don't already know,

13
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:54,820
I'm Annemarie with
Speak Confident English,

14
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,460
everything I do here is designed to
help you get the confidence you want for

15
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:03,130
your life and work in English.
In this Confident English lesson,

16
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:07,690
you're going to learn six different
ways to express gratitude in English.

17
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,851
As a result,

18
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:13,770
you'll have richer word choices
you can use to express the depth of

19
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:14,604
your gratitude.

20
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,200
Before we dive into this and let's
explore what gratitude really means.

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,440
A simple dictionary definition states
that gratitude is the quality of being

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,920
thankful. However, as
you've likely discovered,

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,880
a practice of gratitude
is far more profound.

24
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,760
Gratitude is a selfless,

25
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,270
deep appreciation for
the things we receive,

26
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,350
whether tangible or intangible.

27
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,790
And a practice of gratitude can
help you feel more positive,

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,310
build stronger relationships
and experience catharsis or the

29
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,910
release of strong emotions.

30
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,420
On top of all of that regularly
expressing gratitude allows you to

31
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,420
communicate reminisce
about and relish your past

32
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,460
experiences while English speakers
do often say thank you to express

33
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:17,500
their appreciation or
gratitude to someone.

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,140
We tend to go beyond a simple
thank you to express our gratitude

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,570
for a past event or experience.

36
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,010
And here are six ways to
do that phrase. Number one,

37
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:35,210
I'm grateful or thankful.  Rather than
say that you're glad something happened,

38
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:40,450
you can go a step further and start
your sentence with one of these

39
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,730
collocations that begins
with I'm grateful.

40
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,080
I'm grateful for I'm grateful to.

41
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,600
I'm grateful that,

42
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,320
and I'm grateful to someone.

43
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,600
Let me give you a couple
of clear examples.

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,280
If you appreciate someone's
past actions toward you,

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,160
you could say I'm grateful
to my mentor for teaching

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,560
me effective strategies for success.

47
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:12,040
Or if you want to express
appreciation for a recent

48
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,740
experience,

49
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,160
you could say I'm
grateful to have had this

50
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,710
opportunity. And now phrase number two,

51
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,750
I appreciate just like with
I'm grateful we have multiple

52
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,910
collocations using. I
appreciate.  For example,

53
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,150
I appreciate that.

54
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,710
Or I appreciate the fact
that I appreciate followed

55
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:41,940
by an indirect object, for example,
an individual. And I appreciate how,

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,620
let me give you a couple of examples.

57
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,140
When you want to show that you appreciate
a past experience, you could say,

58
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,660
I appreciate how my years of training
got me through the toughest moments of my

59
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:58,580
career. Not only does the word
appreciate express gratitude,

60
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,890
but it also indicates recognition.

61
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,410
You're recognizing the influence of
a past experience or recognizing an

62
00:04:07,411 --> 00:04:11,330
individual. And now phrase
number three, I feel blessed.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,970
This is an ideal sentence starter when
you want to express a deep sense of

64
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:19,970
gratitude. When we start a
sentence with, I feel blessed,

65
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,320
we can follow it with that,
to, for, and with. For

66
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:27,720
example, in your life,

67
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,760
I'm sure there is one person
situation or circumstance that you

68
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:35,680
feel truly deeply grateful for.

69
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,240
And you can express that
gratefulness by saying,

70
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,630
I felt blessed for having another
opportunity to rebuild my business

71
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,310
phrase. Number four on our list
today is I count my blessings.

72
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,230
This is a popular idiom used to
recognize all the positive things

73
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,390
that have happened in someone's
life. For instance, you might say,

74
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:04,020
I count my blessings when I think
about how lucky I was to get hired

75
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,540
before the recession. In addition to
that expression, you might have heard,

76
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,860
I count my blessings twice,

77
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,660
and of course this communicates an
even stronger sense of gratitude.

78
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,260
For example,

79
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,380
I count my blessings twice that my
daughter was able to graduate despite

80
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:25,410
the ups and downs she's experienced
over the last few years.

81
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:30,450
Phrase number five for expressing
gratitude is I'm fortunate.

82
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,450
Every now and then when
we reflect on the past,

83
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,610
we may also have a sense
of feeling lucky as well as

84
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,450
thankful. And when we have that sense,

85
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,280
using the words I'm fortunate is an
ideal way to express that combination

86
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:50,520
of feelings. For example, in my situation,

87
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,720
I would say with absolute certainty,

88
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,760
I feel fortunate for
having an amazing team.

89
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,360
And now phrase number six,

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,120
our last way to express gratefulness
in today's Confident English lesson

91
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,520
is I'm indebted.

92
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,720
When you think back on the people in your
life who have helped you move forward,

93
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,280
they may have done so with
great kindness, empathy,

94
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,710
and generosity.

95
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,110
When you want to express your
gratitude for that individual

96
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:28,630
in a way that also indicates that
you want to share that same kindness,

97
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,670
empathy, or generosity
with them in the future,

98
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,380
you can use I'm indebted. To do that,
we use the structure I'm indebted to. 

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,740
And then the individual, for example,

100
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,100
I'm indebted to my sister for guiding
me through some of the most difficult

101
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,100
moments in my life.

102
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,300
Now that you have six new phrases
to fully express your gratitude,

103
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:55,860
let's finish with three creative ways
to put all of this into practice.

104
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,330
Tip number one is to
use intensifiers words,

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,730
such as forever eternally,

106
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,810
extremely intensify,

107
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,730
the overall sense of gratitude that
you want to express. For example,

108
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,810
I'm forever grateful for the kindness
and support of my neighbor when our house

109
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:16,644
was robbed.

110
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,680
Tip number two for putting your
gratitude into practice is to create a

111
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:25,440
gratitude journal. In all the hustle
and bustle of our daily lives,

112
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,000
it's easy to lose sight of the
things that we're grateful for,

113
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,000
and instead be overwhelmed by
the negatives that surround us.

114
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,910
Starting a gratitude journal not only
allows you to use this new language,

115
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,550
but also counterbalance
those negative impacts.

116
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:48,310
One common recommendation for implementing
a gratitude journal is to set aside

117
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,630
three to five minutes a day,

118
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,030
and simply write down a few things
that you feel that sense of gratitude

119
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,460
for. And you can use all of these
sentence starters to help you.

120
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,220
In fact, you could have them
listed at the top of a page,

121
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,380
so they're easy to reference and they
help you think about what you're grateful

122
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,740
for in that moment that
you sit down to reflect.

123
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,420
And finally tip number three for how to
put gratitude into practice is to write

124
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,700
a note or a letter.

125
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,890
Never underestimate the
power of a handwritten note.

126
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,450
The next time you want to show
gratitude towards someone,

127
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,730
consider writing them a handwritten
note, or if necessary an email.

128
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,410
You'd be surprised how rare
this practice is and how

129
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,800
uplifting it can be for the receiver.
When you sit down to write that note,

130
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,840
you can use some of these sentence
starters to help you express what you're

131
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,320
grateful for. And now to
finish this lesson today, I
have two questions for you.

132
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,840
So you can immediately practice some of
the phrases that you've learned today.

133
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,393
Question one,

134
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,760
which phrases from today's lesson
are you most excited to begin using

135
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,760
in your English practice?

136
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,520
Give me an example of one of them
and include what you're grateful for.

137
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,720
And question number two, take a
moment to reflect on the past year,

138
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,350
what is a past experience or an individual
that you're feeling grateful for

139
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,350
and how would you express that?

140
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,350
Choose one of the six
phrases you've learned today.

141
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:27,430
And if you'd like share your example
with me in the comments below as

142
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:30,950
