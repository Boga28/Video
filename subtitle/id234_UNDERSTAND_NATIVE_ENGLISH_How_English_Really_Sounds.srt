1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:04,110
Well, hey there, I'm Emma from mmmEnglish.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,970
Today we are going to practise saying ten of the most common

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,007
English words.

4
00:00:10,007 --> 00:00:13,440
Now of course, I'll show you how to pronounce them correctly,

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,227
but even better,

6
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:18,953
how native speakers actually pronounce these words

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,550
naturally when they speak.

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,338
So this lesson is going to help you to understand

9
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:25,703
fast talking native English speakers,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,851
but it will also help you to sound more relaxed

11
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:32,280
as you begin to speak English fluently.

12
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,110
But to do that I need you to practise with me out loud.

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,250
Can you do that?

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,950
When I say the most common words in English,

15
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,598
I'm talking about the ones that occur most frequently.

16
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:53,280
And in English, these are function words,

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,169
the words that exist to make our sentences

18
00:00:56,169 --> 00:00:57,690
grammatically correct,

19
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,170
articles, prepositions, pronouns,

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,850
and even some really simple verbs that we use every day.

21
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,950
Now because they are so common and they're used so often,

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,106
native English speakers use them quite quickly

23
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,890
and very efficiently when we say them,

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,474
which means that the pronunciation of a

25
00:01:19,474 --> 00:01:21,690
word that you learned from a dictionary

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,789
or from your English teacher

27
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:27,675
may not be exactly how it sounds when spoken

28
00:01:27,675 --> 00:01:30,810
at a natural pace by a native English speaker.

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,190
Let's get started with at.

30
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:38,481
Now, sometimes you will hear this word stressed.

31
00:01:38,481 --> 00:01:39,488
At.

32
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,450
You need to be here at three o'clock.

33
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,770
And by stressing at in that sentence, I'm adding emphasis.

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm making the meaning stronger.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,989
You need to be here exactly at three o'clock,

36
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:56,550
not before, not after, at three.

37
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,500
But most of the time when you hear this word, it's unstressed.

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,970
It's not stressed.

39
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,605
And that strong vowel sound

40
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,640
reduces to a schwa.

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,704
I'll meet you at the car.

42
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:28,511
I'll pick you up at eight. 

43
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:32,115
The verb do conjugates, doesn't it?

44
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,930
So it can be do or does depending on the subject.

45
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,452
What you need to remember is that when do is the main verb

46
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,237
in our sentence. It's usually stressed.

47
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,920
I do it often.

48
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,890
But as an auxiliary verb,

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,560
it's helping the main verb in our sentence

50
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,583
and then it becomes a grammatical word. It usually

51
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,101
reduces down.

52
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:03,875
Do you want to come?

53
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:05,509
Try it.

54
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,730
If you're using does instead of do, it also reduces.

55
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,160
Does becomes...

56
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,460
Does she need to see it?  

57
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,493
Your turn.

58
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,106
Do you feel like your English speaking skills

59
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,400
are holding you back?

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,120
Others aren't really seeing you for who you really are.

61
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,850
Anytime I had to talk with natives,

62
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,530
I was just so unconfident because I was afraid of

63
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,210
making mistakes all the time.

64
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,990
Most of the time I read in English and I understand,

65
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,011
I watch the videos with the subtitles

66
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,530
but in that moment to speak, I felt afraid.

67
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,200
I felt shame. 

68
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,088
It's time to break free from those negative feelings

69
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:04,120
and find your English voice with Hey Lady!

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,944
We understand the challenges that women face

71
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:08,290
on their English journey,

72
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,904
and that's why we're growing a supportive community of women

73
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,620
who are working towards the same goal.

74
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,010
Speaking English with confidence and ease.

75
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,140
From when I joined to today is that chance to

76
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:26,772
talk with people without fear of judgment.

77
00:04:26,772 --> 00:04:29,650
When we see each other, we're so happy,

78
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,265
and we have the opportunity to get to know new people

79
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:36,442
all the time. I mean, it's really amazing for me. 

80
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,520
It's really like a dream come true actually.

81
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:45,147
Join Hey Lady! today and start living your best life in English!

82
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:48,670
To find out more, look for the link down in the description below.

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,410
As a pronoun,

84
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,309
you can be stressed when we need to clarify

85
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:55,330
who is doing something.

86
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,683
I didn't ask you. I asked her!

87
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,400
But we don't always emphasise you. Often you just hear it as..

88
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:10,443
Do you know who did it?

89
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,789
I'll meet you there.

90
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:19,330
As can be stressed as well.

91
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,450
I guess it didn't take as long as last time!

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,500
But usually this is an unstressed word,

93
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,486
so it sounds more like...

94
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:32,276
So again, we're using our

95
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:35,830
schwa sound for that unstressed vowel sound.

96
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:46,739
It wasn't as hard as I thought.

97
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,977
Try it now.

98
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,428
Now there is a pattern to look for here and more importantly

99
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:56,680
to listen for.

100
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,634
And that is the way that words that start with a vowel sound

101
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:05,360
often link to the last sound of the word before it

102
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,890
when spoken naturally.

103
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,714
And that link happens when there is a consonant sound

104
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:12,188
at the end of that word.

105
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,907
As starts with a vowel.

106
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,590
So this is a perfect opportunity to highlight it for you.

107
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:30,148
It wasn't as hard as I thought.

108
00:06:30,387 --> 00:06:31,507
Try it.

109
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,770
Okay, so let's talk about grammatical words that start with

110
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,063
the letter H,

111
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,506
like he, him, her

112
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:46,020
and even have and has.

113
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,960
All of these words are often pronounced without the H sound.

114
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,845
when speaking quickly.

115
00:06:52,845 --> 00:07:00,482
Does he want to come?

116
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,170
I'll ask him if you want.

117
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,300
But remember,

118
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,742
if you are using this reduced form

119
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,860
and you are not pronouncing the H,

120
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,450
you must link the to the word before it.

121
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,367
I'll ask him if you want.

122
00:07:20,157 --> 00:07:21,314
Try it.

123
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:30,552
I want to buy a car. 

124
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:32,000
Try it.

125
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,540
Okay, let's try the verb have or has now.

126
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,800
So just like the verb do, we conjugate have,

127
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,641
depending on the subject.

128
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:45,830
Sometimes it's has.

129
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,190
So when this is the main verb in a sentence,

130
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,793
it's stressed and both have and has

131
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:53,832
use the 

132
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,399
vowel sound.

133
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,806
But just like the pronouns we talked about, sometimes

134
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:03,722
native speakers will drop that H sound when speaking quickly.

135
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:09,140
She has three dogs.

136
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:15,625
I have two.

137
00:08:15,986 --> 00:08:19,407
Now have is another one of these special verbs. It's an

138
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:20,630
auxiliary verb.

139
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:24,800
It is an auxiliary verb in all of the perfect tenses,

140
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,220
which is why it is such a common word in English.

141
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,970
Usually when it's the main verb in a sentence, it's stressed,

142
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,769
but it's unstressed when it's an auxiliary verb in a perfect tense.

143
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,630
And when it's spoken, we often use contractions.

144
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,430
I have becomes I've.

145
00:08:46,197 --> 00:08:47,256
We have

146
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,671
becomes we've.

147
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:53,769
He has becomes he's.

148
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,930
Now it can be stressed when it's an auxiliary verb

149
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,055
if we're trying to emphasise that something is true.

150
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:03,210
I've been to India.

151
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,580
No you haven't.

152
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,836
I have, I have been to India!

153
00:09:11,576 --> 00:09:12,817
Here's a good one.

154
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:13,916
Grammatically,

155
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,238
but is used in several different ways

156
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,407
and it can be stressed.

157
00:09:19,407 --> 00:09:21,900
So when it's stressed it's pronounced,

158
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,431
but.

159
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,290
I'll help you, but I need a favor first,

160
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,910
more often than not,

161
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,170
but is usually unstressed and the pronunciation changes.

162
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,770
So instead of but, it becomes,

163
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,668
but.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,310
But I don't want to. 

165
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,091
Try it.

166
00:09:53,490 --> 00:10:07,357
They ate it, but they didn't like it.

167
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,880
Now it's unusual to hear this word stressed

168
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,000
unless you are referring to the number four.

169
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,600
For is usually unstressed. And again,

170
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,140
it's that vowel sound that reduces to the schwa.

171
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,541
Instead of for, you hear

172
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:34,170
And in my accent,

173
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,040
you don't hear the pronunciation of that final R.

174
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,661
The ending is just the vowel sound.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,517
I bought this apple for you.

176
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:54,953
Can you get one for me?

177
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:56,340
Try it.

178
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,500
Of is almost always unstressed.

179
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,600
Instead of saying,

180
00:11:04,862 --> 00:11:06,092
of,

181
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:10,661
reduce or relax that vowel sound down to a schwa.

182
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:24,973
Would you like a cup of tea?

183
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,210
Do you notice how that consonant sound at the end of cup

184
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,470
links to of and that vowel sound?

185
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,660
Would you like a cup of tea?

186
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,920
Of course, how could we forget it?

187
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,701
Ninety-nine per cent of the time when you hear it

188
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:54,103
being spoken in English, it's unstressed.

189
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,410
So when I just said it,

190
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,770
then I was stressing it, emphasising it,

191
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,770
so you knew which word I was talking about.

192
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,346
But it doesn't usually sound like this.

193
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:07,500
It usually sounds like..

194
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:14,080
Again, that schwa sound, you've got to relax.

195
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:17,264
You've got to get into this sound and relax with me.

196
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,594
And usually we use a stop T at the end here.

197
00:12:23,594 --> 00:12:26,002
So the air is not released.

198
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,820
Instead of 

199
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:35,126
we catch the air

200
00:12:35,126 --> 00:12:37,870
so that we can move quickly onto the next sound.

201
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,400
So you will often just hear it being pronounced as

202
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:46,013
You should be able to say it quite quickly

203
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:48,242
when you don't have to release the air.

204
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:55,386
I want it now.

205
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:06,287
Get it out of the car.

206
00:13:07,325 --> 00:13:08,230
Goodness,

207
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,760
there are lots of reductions and linking happening in that

208
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,215
sentence, aren't there?

209
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:16,263
Get it out of the car.

210
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,240
Understanding how these really common English words actually

211
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,821
sound when they're spoken in natural English

212
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:30,190
is really important.

213
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,850
To understand native speakers when they're talking fast,

214
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,140
they're talking quickly,

215
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,580
you need to know how these sounds reduce down

216
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,730
and they link together when spoken.

217
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,567
So I'm super glad that you hung around to watch this lesson

218
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:45,640
all the way through.

219
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,505
Make sure you bookmark this video or you save the playlist

220
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:52,260
because you need to come back and review
it

221
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,350
with me a few times.

222
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,110
Keep coming back to practise with me again and again.

223
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,060
Now I have another video just like this one coming out soon with

224
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,272
ten more common English words

225
00:14:04,272 --> 00:14:07,741
so that we can practise their natural pronunciation together.

226
00:14:07,741 --> 00:14:10,060
So make sure you subscribe,

227
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,786
you come back and check out the next video.

228
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:15,408
But in the meantime, if you want to learn more about

229
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:17,920
linking and naturally spoken English,

230
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,180
check out this series right here that I made for my students.

231
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,338
You are absolutely going to love it.

232
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:25,662
