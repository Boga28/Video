Hi. I'm Rebecca from engVid. In this lesson,
you'll have a chance to review eight common

2
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:10,298
English errors. So,
let's see how you do.

3
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:19,529
The first one: "Today morning I woke up late."
So, what's wrong with that? There is actually

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,960
something wrong with each and every one of
these. I'll tell you that in advance; there's

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,156
no... There are no tricks here. Okay?
So, what's wrong with that sentence?

6
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:35,805
"Today morning I woke up
late." Well, it should be:

7
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:41,551
"This morning". Okay? We
don't say: "Today morning".

8
00:00:41,577 --> 00:00:43,894
We say: "This morning".

9
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:55,170
Number two: "What's the different?" What's the
different? Well, that's wrong too, because

10
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,156
"different" is an adjective. What
you want to use here is the noun.

11
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:03,843
So, what's the
noun of this word?

12
00:01:10,105 --> 00:01:15,740
"Difference". "What's the difference?" Okay?
This is a really common error, so make

13
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,509
sure you don't make this one.

14
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:29,800
Next one: "I met John two years before." Okay?
What's wrong with that? Well, over here,

15
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:40,152
we can't say: "I met John two years before."
We can say: "I met two... I met John two years

16
00:01:40,178 --> 00:01:48,619
ago." All right? If you use the word "before",
then you have to say before something. "Before

17
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:55,279
I graduated". Okay? "Before I got married",
or whatever. But you can't use "before" by

18
00:01:55,305 --> 00:02:02,139
itself. So the proper word there is "ago".
"I met John two years ago."

19
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:12,239
Next one: "This is a six-months course." That
sounds almost okay, but it's not okay. So

20
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,126
the mistake here is

21
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:22,183
with the "s". When we use this
expression, it becomes... The entire

22
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:27,142
expression becomes an adjective for
the noun "course". So we should say:

23
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:31,333
"This is a six-month course.",

24
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,799
"This is a million dollar contract." And
so on. Okay? That's another... Each of

25
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:42,524
these is a different element of grammar,
different aspect of grammar, and so on.

26
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:53,610
Next, number five: "Thank you. I really enjoyed."
What's wrong with that? Well, the problem

27
00:02:53,610 --> 00:03:04,844
is here. "Enjoyed" is a reflexive verb, so you
would need to say: "I really enjoyed myself.",

28
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:14,213
"I really enjoyed myself.", "He enjoyed himself.",
"She enjoyed herself.", "We enjoyed ourselves.",

29
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,439
"They enjoyed themselves." Okay? So there
are certain reflexive verbs in English, and

30
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:25,480
we need to use them correctly.
That's one of them. Very common one.

31
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,239
Okay, number six: "Did you loose your cellphone?"
What's wrong with that? I helped you a little

32
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:42,180
bit by actually showing you where the error
is. So, many people make this error. This

33
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,206
is actually a spelling mistake. You
should be spelling the word this way.

34
00:03:50,232 --> 00:03:56,988
"Did you lose your cellphone?" "Loose"
is an adjective which means not tight,

35
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:58,939
and "lose" is the opposite

36
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:07,240
of "find". Okay? "Did you lose your cellphone?"
Also, the pronunciation is "lose" and not

37
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:08,206
"loose".

38
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:20,560
Next one: "This is an academic course.", "This
is an academic course." So, what was wrong

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,629
with what I said there? Okay?
So, what was wrong was my

40
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,918
pronunciation of that.

41
00:04:28,944 --> 00:04:37,477
So many people mispronounce this word.
It is not "academic". It is "academic".

42
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,864
The stress is on the middle.

43
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:48,770
Academic. "This is an academic course.", "This
is an academic program." Okay? So, if... In

44
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,272
case you make that mistake. I'm not
saying you do. In case you do,

45
00:04:52,298 --> 00:04:53,914
make sure you correct it.

46
00:04:53,914 --> 00:04:58,060
Last one: "Yes, I
have a free time."

47
00:04:59,193 --> 00:05:03,734
Is that...? What's wrong there?
What's going on? Okay,

48
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,680
here. We don't need to say: "A free time".
We need to say: "Free time", because this

49
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,210
is a... Time is an
uncountable noun.

50
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,840
Now, each one of these examples represents
a different aspect of grammar. So, how can

51
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,840
you possibly learn all of them? Well, I'll
give you two easy ways to help you out. One

52
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,020
is to go to our website: www.engvid.com, because
there, we have currently I think more than

53
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:40,069
700 lessons on different aspects of English
grammar and of English in general for exams,

54
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:46,080
for writing, speaking, all kinds of things. And
by watching them, you can find the lessons

55
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,404
that you actually need. And the other thing
is that we also have... I've written actually

56
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:57,016
a resource which might help you, which shows
50 such common errors that people make in

57
00:05:57,042 --> 00:05:59,873
English, and that might
help you out as well. Okay?

58
00:05:59,899 --> 00:06:04,864
So, I hope you did well, and I hope you
continue to do better and better in English.

59
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,484
All the best with your English.
Bye for now.
