00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Vanessa:
Hi, I'm Vanessa from  

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,680
SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com. Congratulations! 
You got the job. Let's talk about it. 

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:20,940
"Congratulations! You got the job." What wonderful 
words to hear. But what comes before that? A job  

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:26,760
interview. When you hear those two words, how 
do you feel? Does your heart begin to beat? As  

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,680
you start to breathe heavily, do your palms 
get sweaty? Well, if you feel nervous about  

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,560
a job interview, don't worry. Millions of people 
around the world also feel the same way. In fact,  

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:42,300
if you didn't feel nervous for a job interview, 
it would be a little strange. But never fear,  

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,480
today I am here to help. The best way to ace 
the interview and get the job is to practice. 

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,600
So today, my husband Dan and I have a fun 
role play interview for you. My husband,  

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,360
Dan, is the hiring manager at a graphic 
design firm and he is looking for a new  

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,660
graphic designer. Maybe that will be me. I will 
be answering these questions, giving you a sample  

12
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,060
answer and some tips for each question. Like 
always, to help you with this important lesson,  

13
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,720
I have created a free PDF worksheet with all of 
these top 10 interview questions, sample answers,  

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,360
and most importantly, there is space for you 
to write your own sample answer. I want you  

15
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,300
to write that out and practice it. Say it out 
loud three times so that you can prepare for  

16
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,240
your job interview and ace it and get the job.
All right. Are you ready for the job interview  

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,420
to find the perfect candidate for the graphic 
design position? Let's see question number one. 

18
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,460
Dan:
Hi, Vanessa. Thank  

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,240
you for coming in today. Why don't you start 
by telling me a little bit about yourself? 

20
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,220
Hi, Vanessa. Thank you for coming in today. 
Why don't you start by telling me a little  

21
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,960
bit about yourself?
Vanessa: 

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,940
Certainly. First of all, I've always 
been labeled as artistic so it just  

23
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,780
made sense to study graphic design 
in college. Then when I graduated,  

24
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,020
I moved to Chicago and worked for a fast paced 
design team, making marketing brochures for a  

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,800
big insurance company. It was great, 
but now that I have the experience,  

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,080
I would love to work with a more local business 
where I can have more contact with the clients. 

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,960
Tip: keep it brief and professional. They don't 
need to know that you go kayaking every weekend  

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:30,240
and that you visited 30 countries. But as 
they say, you never have a second chance to  

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:36,840
make a first impression. So make sure you sit up 
straight, smile, be pleasant, and make them think  

30
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,460
"I would be crazy not to hire you."
Let's go to question number two. 

31
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,480
Dan:
I see. So why are you interested in this job? 

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,820
I see. So why are you interested in this job?
Vanessa: 

33
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,100
I want this job because I'm passionate about 
graphic design. I see myself working in this  

34
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:02,040
field long term because it involves hard work, 
creativity, and innovation. And from my research,  

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,260
it seems like your company also has these 
same values. I'm excited to work for a  

36
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,600
company that shares the same values I do.
Tip: this answer shows your long term  

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,520
commitment to the job and to the company. 
Also, it shows that you did some research  

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,020
about the company in advance. This will 
put you a notch ahead of other candidates  

39
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,460
so make sure to do your research in advance.
All right. Let's go to question number three. 

40
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,780
Dan:
That's  

41
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,540
great. How did you hear about this position?
That's great. How did you hear about this  

42
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,620
position?
Vanessa: 

43
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,400
I read about your company, and I've been 
interested in working here for several  

44
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
months. I hoped that a graphic design 
position would open up so I created  

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,760
an alert on LinkedIn to let me know if that 
happened, and I got an alert, and here I am. 

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,480
Tip: this answer shows that you were proactive 
about finding a job, especially a job in this  

47
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,920
company. It shows that you care about them 
and it makes them feel good about themselves  

48
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,700
as well, which hopefully is all true.
All right. Let's go to the next question. 

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,420
Dan:
So tell me, what are your biggest strengths? 

50
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,620
So tell me, what are your biggest strengths?
Vanessa: 

51
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,560
Some of my biggest strengths are my creativity 
and my ability to learn quickly. I'm also good  

52
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,180
at working with clients and I'm a good 
listener, so this means that I listen to  

53
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,700
exactly what my clients want and I make sure 
that the final designs reflect the heart of  

54
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,500
their business. Finally, I'm very punctual, 
so I always can meet the project deadlines. 

55
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:39,240
Tip: be confident, but don't brag. In this 
situation, it is absolutely necessary to say  

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,640
what you are good at, what are your strengths. 
Do not downplay your strengths. Also, notice  

57
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,460
that in this answer, I gave some adjectives. 
I'm creative, I am a good listener, but I also  

58
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,760
said why they're important. "This means that," 
you can always add this phrase in your answers  

59
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:02,520
to give a good example. "This means that I will 
listen to your clients and I will have designs  

60
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,520
that reflect the heart of their business." Why are 
those traits important? They're just words. Well,  

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:14,100
you are going to show concretely how they will 
affect the company. Don't forget to include that  

62
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,880
phrase, "This means that your clients will always 
be satisfied because my designs will reflect the  

63
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,240
heart of their business." Beautiful answer.
All right, let's go to the next question. 

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,000
Dan:
Okay. What are your biggest weaknesses? 

65
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,780
Okay. What are your biggest weaknesses?
Vanessa: 

66
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,880
My biggest weakness is that in my former 
role, I had a more specialized skill set,  

67
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,980
and I understand that for this job I will need 
a more generalized skill set. So I look forward  

68
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,780
to learning quickly and figuring out what all 
of those tasks are so that I can do my best. 

69
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,260
Tip: this is the most difficult question in 
an interview, in my opinion, so you need to  

70
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,940
be very careful and prepared about how you're 
going to answer this. You could say, "Well,  

71
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,000
sometimes I'm late." Or, "Well, sometimes I just 
forget about what I'm supposed to do," You will  

72
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,060
not get the job. Instead, you need to choose 
a weakness that you can frame in a positive  

73
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:15,600
way. So notice in my answer I said, "Well, in my 
previous job I had a specialized skill set," and  

74
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,300
then I showed growth. I showed an understanding 
of how I can get better. "I understand for this  

75
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,760
job I will need a more generalized skill set, 
and I'm excited about learning new things."  

76
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:32,280
So this shows you understand how to get better.
Let's take a look at a couple of other examples  

77
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,820
because I think this is a tricky one. If you say 
that you are shy talking in front of large groups,  

78
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,400
how could you frame this in a more positive 
way? You could say, "I'm not yet comfortable  

79
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,740
speaking in front of large groups, but to 
help myself with these public speaking skills,  

80
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,460
I'm going to weekly Toastmaster meetups. I have a 
weekly speaking coach that I meet with to help me  

81
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,920
with this skill." You're showing growth and you're 
showing how you understand that you can get better  

82
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,220
in the future. So make sure you answer this with 
that growth mindset. "Yes, I have this weakness,  

83
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:12,480
but I am working on making it better." Key.
All right, let's go to the next question. 

84
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,860
Dan:
Thank you.  

85
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,320
So where do you see yourself in five years?
Thank you. So where do you see yourself in  

86
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,250
five years?
Vanessa: 

87
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:25,200
In five years, I see myself continuing 
in the graphic design field, but with  

88
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,640
greater responsibility, like taking on 
a leadership role of training junior  

89
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,260
level designers who join the staff.
Tip: when you answer this question,  

90
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:40,560
you need to show your commitment to the company. 
Even if you are not 100% sure that you will still  

91
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,180
be in this position and still working for this 
company, this is your chance to fake it till  

92
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,820
you make it and say that you are interested 
in staying in this position and potentially  

93
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,040
benefiting the company with your increased 
experience. So in my answer, I said that I'm  

94
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:01,560
interested in leadership and I would be interested 
in helping junior level designers come into the  

95
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,200
staff and be well trained. This might be something 
different for you, but make sure you do not say,  

96
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,780
"In five years, I'm interested in becoming the 
manager." Well, maybe that guy's, the manager.  

97
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,520
You don't want to take his job. And you don't want 
to say something completely irrelevant. "Where  

98
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,080
do you see yourself in five years?" "Well, I've 
been thinking about taking a world tour. I'd love  

99
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,860
to visit Japan and Poland and Brazil." They're 
not interested in your personal goals. Instead,  

100
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:34,080
you need to talk about your professional goals 
in five years, ideally with that company in  

101
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,740
a position that will benefit the company.
All right. Let's go to the next question. 

102
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,580
Dan:
Okay. What experience do you have in this role? 

103
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,500
Okay. What experience do you have in this role?
Vanessa: 

104
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,360
I mentioned that when I lived in Chicago, I 
worked for a fast-paced design company making  

105
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,180
marketing brochures for a big insurance company, 
so I'm experienced making high level design pieces  

106
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,460
on a tight deadline. I also interned for a 
small company right after college, making  

107
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,800
their websites and setting up several graphic 
design elements for their social media channels. 

108
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,100
Tip: for this question, have specific details 
in mind. Notice how I said I worked for a fast  

109
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,440
paced design company, we had a tight deadline, 
I also interned. I gave specific examples of my  

110
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,560
experience. I didn't say, "Well, I've been doing 
graphic design for a while. And yeah, I have a  

111
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,260
lot of experience." You will not get the job if 
you say this. You need specific examples in mind,  

112
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,100
and that will help you to ace the interview.
Let's go to the next question. 

113
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,640
Dan:
Tell me, why did you leave your most recent job? 

114
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,960
Tell me, why did you leave your most recent job?
Vanessa: 

115
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,660
I'm looking for a fresh opportunity that's more 
client-based. One of the advantages of working  

116
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,360
in Chicago is that I got to work alongside other 
graphic design professionals, but I didn't get to  

117
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,400
work directly with clients, and that's the part 
that's the most rewarding to me. I enjoy helping  

118
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,340
local businesses transform their vision into a 
graphic design that truly represents their brand. 

119
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,980
Tip: this is another tricky question because 
they're looking to see if you will say something  

120
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,640
negative about your past job, your past coworkers, 
your past boss. This can really make it or break  

121
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,580
it for you in the interview so make sure that you 
say something that states a skill that you learned  

122
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,340
in your past job and how it can be applied to 
your current job. I especially use the phrase  

123
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,740
"That's really rewarding to me." That means 
that I am personally fulfilled. And a company  

124
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,200
wants you to be... Well, a good company, wants 
you to be personally fulfilled because you will  

125
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,400
stay in that job and do a good job and have good 
rapport with your coworkers when you are rewarded,  

126
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,640
when you feel like this is a satisfying job.
So when you say, "Hey, I see working in this  

127
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,260
company as something very rewarding to me because 
I love working with clients. That's what I missed  

128
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,660
in my previous job so I'm excited to work with 
clients." Notice I didn't say anything bad about  

129
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,580
my boss. "Oh, my boss. You should have heard about 
him. Oh my goodness." Nope. There's no bashing,  

130
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,880
There's no negative talk about my past job. 
Just a skill or part of the job that I would  

131
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,360
like to do differently in this company.
Great. Let's go to the next question. 

132
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,360
Dan:
So why should we hire you? 

133
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,930
So why should we hire you?
Vanessa: 

134
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,340
You should hire me because I can take 
on a lot of responsibility without much  

135
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,500
supervision. I'm also innovative. I can 
come up with creative, fun ways to meet  

136
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,400
your client's needs while upholding the 
positive reputation of this company. 

137
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,400
Tip: for this question, for each thing that 
you state, you need to give a why. Why is  

138
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:51,300
that important? "I'm a fast learner." Well, who 
cares? "I can do it without much supervision."  

139
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:57,540
That is the why. Most managers do not want to 
be over your shoulder asking you, "Why didn't  

140
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,800
you do the deadline? Come on, it's coming soon. 
What do you..." No, they want to be able to step  

141
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,840
back and just let you do what you need to do. 
So you're telling them, "Don't worry. I got it.  

142
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,580
You won't need to supervise me much because I 
can take responsibility and it'll be great." 

143
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,860
For the next thing, I said, "I'm innovative." 
Well, why does innovation matter? Why do you  

144
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,020
care that I'm innovative? I need to give a reason. 
And I said, "Oh, your clients will be satisfied  

145
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:28,980
with my creative fun designs that will uphold the 
company's reputation." I'm not just thinking about  

146
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,120
myself. I don't want them to say, "Oh, you're 
just the best designer. You're so great." No,  

147
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,460
I want the reputation of the company to be 
the thing that stands out here. So the key is,  

148
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,880
for each of your answers, you need to give 
"That means that you won't need to manage me  

149
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,040
much because I can take responsibility. That 
means that your clients will be satisfied and  

150
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,080
the reputation of this company will be upheld." 
You need to give a why for each of these answers. 

151
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,050
All right. Let's go to our final question.
Dan: 

152
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:02,460
Thank you so much for your time. Before 
we go, do you have any questions for me? 

153
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,380
Thank you so much for your time. Before 
we go, do you have any questions for me? 

154
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,960
Vanessa:
Yes. Well, we covered a lot in this  

155
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,060
interview, but I was wondering what would you like 
me to focus on during the first month on the job? 

156
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,560
Tip: this question is a bit controversial. Some 
people say you should always have a question  

157
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:25,260
prepared. Some people say you shouldn't ask a 
question. And the answer is, it's not black or  

158
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:30,720
white, it's just your choice. But let's talk about 
two more questions you could ask. You could ask,  

159
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:37,500
"What's a typical day look like in this role?" 
Or you could ask, "How is success measured in  

160
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,400
this company?" It's a little bit more of a 
heavy question, but it shows that you care  

161
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,520
about being successful. Or you could simply say, 
"I think we covered everything, but if anything  

162
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,500
comes up, I'll let you know." Great.
Well, what should you never, ever,  

163
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:59,160
ever ask in a job interview? You should never ask 
something that is easily found on the company's  

164
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,560
website. If there's anything publicly shown like 
who their clients are, these types of things,  

165
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,860
do not ask this because it shows that you didn't 
do your research and the interviewer will think,  

166
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,080
"I'm just wasting my time." So make sure that you 
do not ask something that is easily found online. 

167
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,760
Dan:
Congratulations,  

168
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,240

Congratulations, you're hired. I'll  

169
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,470

Vanessa: 

170
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,580

start in this role. I'll see you on Monday.
