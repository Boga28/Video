00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:12,106
Have you got a few minutes of free time? Rather than killing time playing games, let’s have a whale of a time learning 30 time-related idioms.

2
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:19,732
These are phrases that are used in everyday situations, formal and informal so it’s good to be familiar with them.

3
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:29,040
This lesson is sponsored by Lingoda but more about them later as it’s high time we started on the list!  Let's go!

4
00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:43,389
1. It’s high time . This phrase can be used to say that it is time to do something that should have happened a long time ago.

5
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:49,970
“You’ve been struggling with your Maths homework for months. It’s high time we got you a tutor.”

6
00:00:49,970 --> 00:01:02,886
2. Against the clock  If you’re doing something “against the clock”, you are doing it as quickly as possible in order to meet a deadline.

7
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:10,388
“The party guests will arrive at 6pm so we’re working against the clock to get everything ready in time. Quick!”

8
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:21,181
3. The eleventh hour . If something happens ‘at the eleventh hour’, that means it happens at the last possible moment.

9

“I found that question really difficult but I remembered the answer at the eleventh hour, just before the exam finished.”

00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:46,542
4. To make up for lost time . To do something faster or more often in order to compensate for not having done it quickly enough or often enough is known as ‘making up for lost time’.

11
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:54,174
Many of us, because of the pandemic, are now making up for lost time because of all the things we missed.

12
00:01:54,174 --> 00:02:02,217
“We didn’t get to see family much last year so this year, I hope to make up for lost time and spend lots of time with them.”

13
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:12,606
5. In the nick of time . To do something ‘in the nick of time’, means to do it just in time.

14
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:20,813

15
00:02:20,813 --> 00:02:32,767
6. The ship has sailed . We use this phrase informally to discuss an opportunity which has passed or a situation which can no longer be changed.

16
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:39,779
“I thought about running a marathon this year but I haven’t done any training so that ship has sailed.”

21
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:37,004
then why not take the challenge and motivate yourself with the cash back reward.
