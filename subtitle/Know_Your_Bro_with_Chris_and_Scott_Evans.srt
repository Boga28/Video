171
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,384
-Dude, this is the most
embarrassing --

172
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,420
This is beyond embarrassing.
Oh, my God.

173
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,754
-But --
[ Laughter ]

174
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:57,155
-Don't -- you shouldn't think of
a different story.

175
00:05:57,155 --> 00:06:01,060
-I say this because I know --
ooh, I hope he's okay.

176
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,195
Maybe it's different on TV.

177
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:05,498
But I've heard him
tell this story.

178
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:06,999
So my father, you know,
picked him up.

179
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,468
We went to the bathroom.
My father dumped his underwear.

180
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:12,238
Back on the mountain.
He pooped his pants again.

[ Laughter ]

182
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,711
So back to the bathroom.

183
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,313
Long underwear are gone.

184
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,315
And at that point, my father was
like, "All right, day's over."

185
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,584
And he went to get the car --

186
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:27,153
This is it.
[ Light laughter ]

187
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,155
And it was me and my sister
and my brother waiting in the,

188
00:06:30,155 --> 00:06:33,259
like, the lobby of the lodge
while my dad --

189
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,994
We're down to last line
of defense.

190
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:37,363
It's just the snow pants,
you know?

191
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,566
And he starts crying, saying
it's going to happen.

192
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,200
[ Laughter ]

193
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,704
And me and my sister are like,
"Just hang on."

194
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,639
And it -- he didn't make it.

195
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,308
You know what I mean?
[ Laughter ]

196
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:51,611
[ Rim shot ]
And it happened.

197
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,211
It happened.

198
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:55,147
Without question, this is
going to be the answer.

199
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,116
-Okay, all right, oh, my gosh.
-It's going to be the answer.

200
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,984
Scott?
First of all --

201
00:06:58,984 --> 00:07:00,919
-Looking over,
I'm seeing reaction.

202
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,123
-No.
-Just -- well, okay.

203
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:07,359
-Look, it's all fine.
-Is it?

204
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,661
-Yeah.
-I remember that

205
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,296
last time I was here.
-It's all going to be fine.

206
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:12,231
I don't want you to get too
excited.

[ Laughter ]

208
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:20,372
Scott, what is your most
embarrassing childhood memory?

209
00:07:20,372 --> 00:07:22,341
-I didn't hold back.

210
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:27,847
-All right, well --
Oh, my God.

[ Laughter ]

212
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:31,917
All right. The only thing
I can think of --

213
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:33,719
oh, God, I wish I could think
of something else,

214
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,020
but now my brain is just like,

215
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,223
"You have nothing else
but this story."

216
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:39,759
Oh, my God.
[ Laughter ]

217
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,095
Like, you wouldn't -- all right.

218
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,031
I'm going to go with this.
God, let it be right.

219
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,600
I was driving home --

220
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,169
-No, isn't that!

with my three siblings
in a car.

230

I was sitting in the front seat.
I don't know how.

231
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,793
And I -- I mean, I feel like --

232
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:18,431
okay, and I had to -- I had to
go to the bathroom.

And I said -- and I begged
my sister, "Pull over."

236
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:25,938
Because I really had to go.

237

She was like, "Where are you
going to go?"

And I was like, "On the street.
I will do it anywhere."

And I went, like --
