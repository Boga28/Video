1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,880
I want to start this English
lesson by saying thank you

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,530
to everyone who filled in the
survey from last week's video.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,260
Over 1500 English learners
filled in the survey

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,920
and let me know what song
they're currently listening to

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,640
in English, what book they're reading,

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,050
the TV show that they
are currently watching,

7
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,970
and about a movie that
they've recently watched.

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,070
I'm sure though, that
you're really curious

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,160
to know what the results are.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,450
I've already seen them.

11
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,820
I made some nice graphs to show you.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,320
So in this video, what
I'll do is I'll show you

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,150
all of the results of the
survey from last week,

14
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,470
so that you know about
the most popular book,

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,440
the most popular song,
the most popular TV show,

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,200
and the current most popular movie

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,740
that people are listening
to, reading, or watching

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,525
in order to improve their English.

19
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,108
(upbeat music)

20
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,740
Well hello, and welcome
to this English lesson

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:53,290
where I'm going to show you
the results of the survey

22
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,300
that many of you filled out last week.

23
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,300
Before we get started though,

24
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,760
if this is your first time here,

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,690
don't forget to click
that red subscribe button

26
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,520
and give me a thumbs up
if this video helps you

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,940
learn just a little bit more English.

28
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,530
Well, it was interesting when
I looked at the responses

29
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,485
to the question what
your favorite song was

30
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,950
because all of you mentioned
your favorite artist

31
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:12,160
and your favorite song.

32
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,520
So let's look at the top five artists

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,170
before we look at the top three songs.

34
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,040
At number five, we have Olivia Rodrigo,

35
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,320
and many of you mentioned
her song "Good 4 U,"

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,470
kind of an angry song,
but it has a good beat,

37
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,700
I really like it.

38
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,740
At number four, we have Lady Gaga.

39
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,120
And many of you mentioned
the song "Shallow"

40
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,650
that I think is a duet
with Bradley Cooper.

41
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,085
At number three, the
third most popular artist,

42
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:40,140
Justin Bieber, who by the way is Canadian,

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,840
and you mentioned a variety
of songs from Justin Bieber.

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,830
At number two, we had The
Weeknd, and most of you mentioned

45
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,490
either "Save Your Tears"
or "Blinding Lights."

46
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,000
And at number one, this
was no surprise to me,

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,510
the number one artist that
you chose was Ed Sheeran.

48
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,640
And you mentioned about
11 or 12 different songs

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,770
from Ed Sheeran, he is
a very popular artist.

50
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,110
But let's look at the most popular songs.

51
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,220
At number three, we had
"Shallow" by Lady Gaga,

52
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,402
again, I think a duet with Bradley Cooper,

53
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:15,120
a very nice song, very, very cool.

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,190
At number two, we had "Love
Yourself" by Justin Bieber.

55
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,030
This was kind of a surprise to me.

56
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,690
It's not a happy song.

57
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,450
It's probably a great song though

58
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,190
to listen to when you're learning English.

59
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,310
He sings very clearly in the song

60
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,170
and you can understand the words.

61
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,650
At number one, we had "Save
Your Tears" by The Weeknd.

62
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,210
This came as no surprise to me.

63
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,390
This was a very clear winner
above all of the other songs.

64
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,720
And it was no surprise

65
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,130
because this song is
actually quite popular.

66
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,960
It's on the radio all the time.

67
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,690
It's in the top 10, I
think, in Canada right now.

68
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,320
It's just a really, really cool song.

69
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,730
So there are your results for
top artists and top songs.

70
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,170
I'm sure you're curious to
know what the top choice was

71
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,920
for book from the survey
that you filled in last week.

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,290
And instead of making you
wait, I'll just tell you,

73
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,270
because there was a clear winner.

74
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,870
The book that came out on top

75
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:09,290
is a book called "The
Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho.

76
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,250
This is an author from Brazil,
and it doesn't surprise me

77
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,900
that an author from Brazil was
the top choice in the survey.

78
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,760
There are many people from Brazil

79
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,300
that watch my YouTube videos,

80
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,810
so maybe they swayed the
results a little bit.

81
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,960
This book is a book that I have not read,

82
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,010
and I promise you, I
will read it this winter.

83
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,130
It looks very, very interesting.

84
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,270
There was no clear second
or third place choice,

85
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,700
but what did show in the results was

86
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,630
that many people read
the Harry Potter books,

87
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,450
so that's a series of books,

88
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,120
and many people read the
books from Jeff Kinney

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,140
called "Diary of a Wimpy Kid."

90
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,650
So the Harry Potter series by JK Rowling,

91
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,590
written for teenagers and young adults,

92
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,680
is a very good series to read
if you are learning English,

93
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,840
great books, interesting stories.

94
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,390
And "Diary of a Wimpy
Kid" is actually written

95
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,380
for younger children,
but there is no shame

96
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,197
in reading kid's books when
you are learning a language.

97
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:02,520
"Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"

98
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,140
my kids read almost all of those books.

99
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,430
Between the age of seven and
eight to about age 11 or 13,

100
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,700
they would read those books,
and they were very interesting.

101
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,810
They're about a little
kid in middle school.

102
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,300
It's just a good little picture,

103
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,810
a humorous picture of American
life for kids in school.

104
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,670
So top choice, "The
Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho,

105
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,980
second place-ish would be
the Harry Potter series,

106
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,240
and third place-ish would
be "Diary of a Wimpy Kid."

107
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,100
When I say ish, it
means, you know, sort of,

108
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,200
it's not really a specific
book that got second or third,

109
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,810
it's kind of a book in a series,

110
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,020
but those are your top three.

111
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,040
I have to be honest,

112
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,520
the results for top TV
show kind of surprised me.

113
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,090
There were a few titles in
there that I was expecting,

114
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,700
but there were a few that were a surprise.

115
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,750
At number five, we have a
show called "Breaking Bad."

116
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,250
This was a surprise to me.

117
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,720
It's about a high school teacher

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,780
who begins to lead a life of crime.

119
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,810
It's an interesting
show, I have watched it.

120
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,960
I should warn you though,
it's very violent,

121
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,330
and you'll see a lot of criminal activity.

122
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,560
In fourth place is a show
called "How I Met Your Mother."

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,460
I have not watched this show,

124
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,190
but it's about a guy named Ted, I think,

125
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,960
who lives in New York City,
and it's a story about

126
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,340
how he met the person who
he eventually married,

127
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,470
so that's kind of how
the title came about.

128
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,050
The third most popular show,

129
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,680
I have to check my list, is "The Office."

130
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,957
This did not surprise me.

131
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:29,370
"The Office" is a very popular
English television show.

132
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,150
There's actually two versions, by the way.

133
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,010
There's the original British version

134
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,320
and there's the American version.

135
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,520
The American version is much more popular.

136
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,350
In second place, this surprised me,

137
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,226
was "The Ellen DeGeneres Show."

138
00:05:41,226 --> 00:05:42,690
I've watched this show.

139
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,060
It is called a daytime talk show,

140
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,100
and it's hosted by Ellen DeGeneres.

141
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,680
And it's on, I think
here it's on around 4:00.

142
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,902
I don't watch it very often,
maybe once every few months,

143
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:54,870
but it's a good show to watch

144
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,500
because you'll see natural
English conversations.

145
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,710
And the number one show, this
show being chosen number one,

146
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,207
this did not surprise me at
all, the top show is "Friends."

147
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:08,550
"Friends" is a show
about a bunch of friends

148
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,840
that live in New York City.

149
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,170
It's actually starting
to seem a little bit old.

150
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,090
If you do watch it to learn English,

151
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,760
there's a few things that they say or do

152
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,110
that just aren't common anymore.

153
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,127
But "Friends" was the top
show out of all the TV shows

154
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:25,670
that people mentioned when
they filled out the survey.

155
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,080
The top choices for movies were
not a surprise to me at all.

156
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,440
They almost mimicked the box office

157
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,620
or the most popular movies of 2021.

158
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,560
At number four, we have "Black Widow,"

159
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,300
starring Scarlett Johansson.

160
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,920
This is a movie from the MCU.

161
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,000
MCU stands for the Marvel
Cinematic Universe.

162
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,030
It was a pretty cool movie.

163
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,400
I watched it with my kids
a couple of months ago.

164
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,740
We really enjoyed it.

165
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,950
The third most popular
movie is "No Time to Die,"

166
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,030
the most recent James Bond movie.

167
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,350
No surprise to see that on the list.

168
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,830
At number two was the movie "Free Guy,"

169
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,970
starring Ryan Reynolds.

170
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,918
This, of course, was no surprise either.

171
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,240
I myself just watched this
movie a few weeks ago.

172
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,280
It's really good, it was really funny.

173
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,330
The top movie though came
as a bit of a surprise.

174
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,670
The top movie is the movie "Dune."

175
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,580
This movie just came out in the last week.

176
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,980
It's a movie based on a book
by Frank Herbert called "Dune,"

177
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,436
which I read a long time
ago when I was a kid.

178
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,240
I would suggest you do this.

179
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,640
If you haven't watched the movie,

180
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,720
read the book, and then go see the movie.

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,510
So in reverse order, once again,

182
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,380
number four, Scarlett
Johansson in "Black Widow,"

183
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,150
number three, Daniel
Craig in "No Time to Die,"

184
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,020
the most recent James Bond movie,

185
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,270
at number two, Ryan Reynolds
in the movie "Free Guy,"

186
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,720
and at number one, a
whole bunch of actors,

187
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,000
very, very good actors,
in the movie "Dune,"

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,070
based on the book by Frank Herbert.

189
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,210
Well hey, thank you so much

190
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,870
for watching this little English lesson

191
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,640
where I gave you the results
of last week's survey.

192
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Don't forget that listening
to music in English,

193
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,020
reading books in English,

194
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,250
watching TV shows and movies in English

195
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,220
are all really good things to do.

196
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,920
A quick recap, listening
to music is awesome

197
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,670
because you can learn all of the lyrics.

198
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,410
You can print out the
lyrics, and memorize them,

199
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,950
and then listen to the
song hundreds of times.

200
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,070
Reading books are awesome

201
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,330
because you can read
fast, you can read slow,

202
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,500
and you can learn a lot of new vocabulary.

203
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,130
Watching TV shows, awesome
because you can hear

204
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,460
the same people speak
episode after episode,

205
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,360
and you can really train
your ear to understand them.

206
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,830
And then movies are just awesome

207
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,250
because you kind of forget
about life for a while

208
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,760
and you immerse yourself
in what's happening.

209
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,010
So do take the time

210
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,010
to do all four of those things regularly.

211
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,760
It will really, really help you.

212
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,909
Thanks again for watching.

213
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,899

learn a little bit of English.

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,300
And if you have the time,

218
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,489
why don't you stick around and
watch another English lesson?

219
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:51,072
(upbeat music)
