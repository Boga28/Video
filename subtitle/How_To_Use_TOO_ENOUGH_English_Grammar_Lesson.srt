00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,300
Hello, I'm Emma from English!

2
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,500
In this lesson, you'll learn how to use

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,000
these little, useful words correctly in English sentences.

4
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,000
Both of these words indicate a degree.

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,200
They give us more information about

6
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,000
an adjective or an adverb or a noun.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,900
So, here 'too' means that it is

8
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,460
more than what is wanted or what is needed.

9
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
So, it's usually a negative thing!

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,559
You are more hungry than you want to be!

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,800
This is really frustrating for you

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,160
because you can't concentrate!

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,080
So here, 'enough' tells us

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,160
that it is the amount that we want or we need.

15
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,000
It's the right amount and this is a positive thing!

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,900
You have what is needed, you are good enough.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,240
Ouch! That is really mean!

18
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,000
Not enough means that it is

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,200
less than the amount that you want or you need.

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,360
It's a really negative thing. It's a pretty mean thing to say.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So, let's look at the structures for each of these words

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,500
with adjectives and adverbs first.

23
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,880
So, 'too' comes before an adjective or an adverb.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,340
Remember that using 'too' with an adjective

25
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:22,620
or an adverb usually suggests that it's a negative thing.

26
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,000
It's more than what is wanted or needed.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, it's not correct to say that the movie was 'too good'

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,900
when you really enjoyed it!

29
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,000
It's also not correct to say that your friend is 'too funny'.

30
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,000
It sounds really strange to native English speakers

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,560
because it suggests that it's more than what you want

32
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,000
or what you need it to be.

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,400
Use 'really' or 'very' or 'so' instead.

34
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,000
That sounds better!

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,400
There are some exceptions to this though,

36
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,580
when you're speaking colloquially

37
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,000
- especially in Australia, where I'm from!

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,020
Like... For example, if someone asked me,

39
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,500
"How are you?"

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,000
I'd probably say, "Not too bad."

41
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,900
This is really common in Australia and it means 'good'

42
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,000
but that's an exception.

43
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay, what about 'enough'?

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
'Enough' comes after the adjective or the adverb.

45
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,820
Now, what about when 'enough' is used

46
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
in a negative sentence?

47
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,000
'Enough' comes after the adjective or the adverb

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but 'not' comes before.

49
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,940
And this has the same meaning as 'I'm too weak'.

50
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,960
... Which means 'it's too cold'!

51
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,560
You can also use 'too' and 'enough' with nouns.

52
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,000
So again, this means that we have more of the noun

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
than we want or we need.

54
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,380
You would choose 'many' if the noun was countable.

55
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,240
And you would choose 'much'

56
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,660
if the noun was uncountable.

57
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,000
Now, if you are not sure about

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,100
which nouns are countable and which are uncountable,

59
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,000
you should check out this lesson right here

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
because I'll explain it for you there!

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So, what about 'enough'?

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, with a noun 'enough' comes before the noun.

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,740
Again, this means that we have the right amount,

64
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,000
the amount that we want and that we need.

65
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,480
And to make these sentences negative we add 'not'

66
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,900
- usually before the main verb.

67
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,200
The 'be' verb is a bit of an exception here, to the rule.

68
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,280
The structure is a little different.

69
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,980
When the 'be' verb is the main verb,

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
then 'not' comes after the main verb.

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, these handy little words will definitely help you to

72
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
express yourself more clearly in English

73
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
and now you know exactly how to use them correctly.

74
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,960
Make sure you practise them.

75
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Write some examples if you want,

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
add them in the comments below!

77
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,600
Remember that 'too'

78
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,400
means that it's more than the necessary amount.

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,000
'Enough' is the necessary amount, it's the exact amount.

80
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,000
And 'not enough' is less than the necessary amount.

81
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,420
And if you've managed to make it through this lesson

82
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,900
all the way to the end

83
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,360
then you are going to get a special reward

84
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,840
