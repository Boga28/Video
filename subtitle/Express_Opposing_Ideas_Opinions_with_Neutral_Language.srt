1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,230
In 2021,

2
00:00:01,231 --> 00:00:05,670
the topic of COVID vaccines has
become a hot topic of conversation.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,930
And in some situations it's
even become a contentious

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:10,860
conversation.

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,020
What that means is that it causes
or is likely to cause an argument

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,400
it's controversial.

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,560
One of the greatest challenges my
students have is feeling comfortable and

8
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:25,500
confident in sharing their opinion,

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,630
especially when someone has a
differing or opposing opinion.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,480
And you might have the same frustration.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:38,280
How do you express your opinion
politely when others disagree or have a

12
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:42,480
different point of view without
getting into an argument? Of course,

13
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:45,810
one strategy is to simply
stay silent and say nothing,

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,190
but that's not a good long-term
solution. If you're here,

15
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:53,730
you're here to become confident
in your English language skills.

16
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,560
And that means the ability to express
yourself clearly to share your opinions

17
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,030
no matter who you're talking to
or what the situation might be.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,040
The good news is there are strategies
you can use to help you effectively,

19
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,600
politely share your opinions
and handle differing

20
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:16,470
opinions using neutral language.
If you don't already know,

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,690
I'm Annemarie with
Speak Confident English,

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,040
this is where you want to be every week
to get the confidence you want for your

23
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,160
life and work in English. By
the end of this video today,

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,570
you will be able to clearly and
politely express disagreement or

25
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:35,310
share an opposing perspective
using neutral phrases with

26
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,490
three powerful strategies.
Plus at the end,

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,390
I'll share three quick tips
to help you stay clear-headed

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,860
when you're in a conversation that
is particularly controversial,

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,210
Let's get started. If you
don't already have them,

30
00:01:56,211 --> 00:02:00,620
I'm going to ask you to get a pen piece
of paper or notebook ready for you to

31
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,860
use, because there will be a lot
of new phrases for you today.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,670
And I want you to keep all of them
so that you can practice using them,

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,380
get comfortable and start using them
regularly in your English conversations.

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,220
And now let's get started
with strategy number one,

35
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,810
when you're working to
use neutral language.

36
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:22,580
Acknowledge the strengths
of the opposing argument or

37
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:24,620
point of view in a conversation.

38
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:28,520
You might know that you absolutely
disagree with what someone else has said

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,640
before you jump in to
share that disagreement,

40
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,980
take a moment to acknowledge the strengths
of the other person's perspective.

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,430
This doesn't mean that you
agree with what they've said,

42
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,320
but you did listen and you're
acknowledging that they've
made some good points.

43
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,480
After you acknowledged those strengths,

44
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,670
then you can go on to use some neutral
language to introduce your opposing

45
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:57,380
perspective. When we do that, we
tend to focus on functional phrases,

46
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:01,570
such as in my opinion,
based on my experience,

47
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,400
it seems to me or my
concerns or my thoughts are.

48
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,130
Let me put all of that
together in an example for you:

49
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:14,080
imagine that you and a team member
are talking about your budget at

50
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:14,530
work.

51
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,480
And there's a bit of disagreement when
you respond to what your coworker has

52
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:19,960
said,

53
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:24,940
you can start by acknowledging the
strengths and then get into your opposing

54
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:29,080
point of view. And here's how that
might sound. Your points are valid.

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,640
And I agree with what you've said about
the expenses. Based on my experience,

56
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,240
an increase in the price for more
profit can have a negative impact on

57
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:41,350
consumer demand. In that example, I'm
acknowledging the other strengths.

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:45,790
I've validated what they
said and I've introduced my

59
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:50,650
opposing idea, but in doing that, I
haven't used any negative language.

60
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,240
It's all very neutral. I didn't
use however, or I disagree.

61
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,770
I simply acknowledge the strengths
and then introduced my own

62
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,604
perspective.

63
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,380
We can use this same strategy in
casual or informal conversations as

64
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:07,030
well. Here's an example.

65
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,500
I understand your reasoning and you've
made some good points. In my opinion,

66
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,760
gradually reducing our expenses will
help us save money for a new house more

67
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:17,020
quickly. Again,

68
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,040
I'm acknowledging the strengths and
validating the other perspective.

69
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,930
And then introducing my own.

70
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,930
The second strategy for handling differing
opinions using neutral language is

71
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:30,790
to use I-statements.

72
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,320
Using I-statements helps to
reduce tension because it avoids

73
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,400
blaming others or pointing
the finger. In other words,

74
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:44,380
there's no accusation and we're
separating the person from

75
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:47,980
the topic or the problem that
we're discussing in this process.

76
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,880
We also can avoid negative
language such as, but,

77
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,620
however I disagree.

78
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,780
The goal is for you to share
your opinion on neutral

79
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:03,700
ground. So to do that, we use
things like, I think, I believe,

80
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,900
I understand, I'm convinced or I would.

81
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,820
In using these I statements instead
of focusing on my disagreement,

82
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,100
I'm shifting the focus to my
opinion and my reasons for

83
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:21,460
my opinion. Let me give you two
examples of what this looks like.

84
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:25,930
One for professional situations and the
second for more personal or informal

85
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:29,680
conversations, let's start with
the professional example. Well,

86
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:32,380
your proposed cuts will
help balance the budget.

87
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,400
I think we should be mindful about how
those cuts will affect our business

88
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,220
longterm and in a personal situation.

89
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,100
I understand that you have
certain goals in mind.

90
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,240
I believe we should focus on how
to minimize the costs of daycare.

91
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:51,040
Look at those two examples carefully.
You can definitely see examples of,

92
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,930
I think I believe,

93
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:58,070
and I understand I've also avoided
any negative language or direct

94
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,090
disagreement,

95
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,740
but I was still able to
introduce and state my opposing

96
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,574
perspective.

97
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,100
And now strategy number three
for handling differing opinions

98
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,540
using neutral language is to
use the power of suggestion.

99
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,790
The power of suggestion can
be used to share an opinion or

100
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,540
perspective without emotional language.

101
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,530
Emotional language tends
to get us into problems.

102
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,300
That's where we start to get frustrated
or angry and it starts to show,

103
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,430
but we want to avoid all of
that by using more neutral

104
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,780
suggestive language,

105
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,160
such as let's consider
or let's think about,

106
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,600
have you thought about
what if we, what about,

107
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,820
what are your thoughts on,

108
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,830
or what do you think about all of
this language helps us to introduce a

109
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,010
suggestion, an alternative idea,

110
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,110
opinion or perspective without
being confrontational or bringing

111
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:07,880
emotion into the conversation. For
example, in a professional conversation,

112
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,710
I might say something like,

113
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:13,070
I agree that customer
satisfaction comes first.

114
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,660
What do you think about training team
members by assigning them different roles

115
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:22,190
every month? In that example, I'm
introducing a different perspective,

116
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,630
maybe even an opinion that
I know others won't like.

117
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,990
And instead of doing it in
a direct, aggressive way,

118
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:34,190
I'm introducing it as a suggestion
in a personal conversation.

119
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:38,780
I could use an example like this. I agree
that we need a more affordable option.

120
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,700
What if we minimize a few other expenses
like going out on the weekends while we

121
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:46,100
look for a more affordable daycare option.

122
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,230
Now that you have three powerful
strategies using neutral language to

123
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:55,640
help you have successful, productive
conversations on differing opinions,

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,530
let's take a look at three tips that
you can use to help you stay calm.

125
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:04,700
And clear-headed when you're
discussing a topic that is

126
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:08,720
particularly controversial or
that you feel strongly about.

127
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,360
Tip number one is to clarify,

128
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,210
in order to avoid assumptions.

129
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,800
When you find yourself poles apart
from another person, in other words,

130
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:22,190
you're on two absolutely
opposite sides of an issue,

131
00:08:22,191 --> 00:08:27,140
it can be easy to start making
assumptions about the other

132
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:30,470
person's perspectives
or their reasons why.

133
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,300
But in order to have a successful
conversation on a sensitive issue,

134
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,430
it's important to know exactly
what the real reasons are

135
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,290
behind someone's position,

136
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,150
not what you think they might be
the best way to do this is to ask

137
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,610
clarifying questions. Now,

138
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,530
if you're not sure what kinds of questions
are clarifying questions or what are

139
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:55,800
the best to use,

140
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,390
keep an eye out for a future lesson
because I've got a lesson coming on that

141
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:05,070
topic very soon. Tip number
two for staying clear,

142
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:08,580
headed is approach problems together,

143
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,470
include the other person in your
thought process and in your problem

144
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,040
solving approach that
isn't always easy to do,

145
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,080
but it leads to a much better
outcome and it helps to avoid things

146
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:26,760
getting tense or conversations
getting into something that

147
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:31,380
becomes an argument. Instead of focusing
on the two different perspectives,

148
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,600
you can bring the focus on how you can
work together toward a common goal or

149
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,640
solving a problem to do that.

150
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:42,960
It's always important to find
the places that you agree on.

151
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,910
For example, maybe both of you agree
that you need to reduce expenses.

152
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,560
So that becomes the common
goal and you work on finding

153
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,870
solutions that you're both okay with.

154
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,910
And tip number three for staying
clear and calm headed is to always be

155
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:03,420
aware of your tone and volume. Honestly,

156
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,800
this one is really tough when you're
communicating on a topic that you're

157
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:09,240
passionate about.

158
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,130
It's very common to start increasing
the volume of your voice or

159
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:17,910
change your tone to indicate
frustration, sarcasm,

160
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,850
or even passion for the topic,

161
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,890
but in order to disagree
successfully and move forward in the

162
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:26,730
conversation,

163
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,080
it's important to be careful
about the tone and volume.

164
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,490
I have to admit that I'm particularly
passionate about politics.

165
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,290
So I have to be careful when I talk to
others with an opposing point of view,

166
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,230
to help me stay calm and clear headed.

167
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,850
I will often step back from the
conversation and say something like

168
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,820
I need a moment to collect my thoughts.

169
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,850
And while I pause and
take time to reflect,

170
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:58,290
I'm also very careful about breathing
in a way that helps to reduce

171
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,330
anxiety or frustration.

172
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,600
And that is something I often
share with my students as well.

173
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,680
In addition to saying something like,
give me a moment to collect my thoughts.

174
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,520
You could also say I need
a moment and that's it.

175
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,010
Just take a pause in the conversation.

176
00:11:14,011 --> 00:11:18,510
Step back from the frustration
so that you can have a productive

177
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:23,490
conversation now that you have these
three powerful strategies with examples of

178
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:24,570
neutral language,

179
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,620
and you have some tips to help
you stay calm and clear headed.

180
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,020
I have two challenge questions for you.

181
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:36,120
I know that giving opinions or
sharing your point of view in a

182
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:40,860
situation where someone has an opposing
point of view can be really difficult.

183
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,240
So let's practice.

184
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:47,280
I have two different scenarios
or topics for you. And in both,

185
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,020
I want you to think about how you would
respond using what you've learned today

186
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,560
in scenario. Number one,

187
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:58,480
I want you to imagine that one of your
friends strongly believes that children

188
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:03,160
should not go back to school
until September, 2022.

189
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,950
However you disagree with that opinion.

190
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,940
How could you express your
opinion without upsetting her,

191
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,460
try using some of the example language
that you've learned today to do that.

192
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,120
And now scenario number two,

193
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,020
your son's teacher recommends that
your son switch from an advanced

194
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:26,700
placement level class to a
regular class based on poor

195
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:27,750
performance.

196
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,580
You know that your son has had
a particularly tough month and

197
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,680
you also know that your son is
more than capable of doing well in

198
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:41,460
the advanced placement level.
How would you express this?

199
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,390
How would you disagree with
your son's teacher? Again,

200
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,300
go over the strategies
we've talked about today,

201
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:53,040
review all the examples of neutral
language and then share an example below.

202
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,930
The best place for you to share is always
in the comment section below the video

203
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,640
or in the online lesson.

204
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,360
Not only will others in the
community be able to learn from you,

205
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,750
but it's also where I go
to review and respond.

206
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,440
If you found this lesson useful to
you today, I would love to know.
