1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,260
Love me like you do

You're the light, you're the night, you're the colour of my blood

8
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,220
You're the cure, you're the pain

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,600
You're the only thing I want to touch

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,520
I don't wanna be needing your love

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,800
Never knew that it could mean so much

12
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,560
I just wanna be deep in your love (so much)

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,500
You're the fear, I don't care, 'cause I've never been so high

14
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:11,900
Follow me, through the dark, let me take you past our satellites

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,940
Cause I really don't care where you are

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,680
You can see the world you brought to life

17
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,900
I just wanna be there where you are (to life)

18
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,000

Little love and little sympathy

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,960
I'm hurting baby

24
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,800

You got me begging, I'm begging I'm on my knees

29
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,100
