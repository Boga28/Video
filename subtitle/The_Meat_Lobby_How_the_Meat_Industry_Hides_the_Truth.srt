1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:14,940
have you noticed whenever you see a 
commercial for ham on TV it's often  

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:23,130
set in the countryside with a nice family 
and a rustic backdrop and the ham is always  

3
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:33,450
pink very pink and 100% natural of course 
the best with a quick initial said it looks  

4
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,910
so tasty it has your mouth watering 
on the couch well that's the point

5
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:51,120
but what if behind this pretty pink hit one of 
the biggest health scandals of our era in 2015 the  

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,420
world health organization listed processed meats 
as carcinogenic for man we decided to investigate  

7
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:07,190
the ingredients used by the Giants of the food 
industry it can induce DNA breaks mutate cells  

8
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:14,360
into sort of pre cancer cells we discovered that 
to impede or halt regulations on certain additives  

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:22,130
food industry lobbies have been working in the 
shadows for decades you have to understand it the  

10
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,200
industry is a money-making business of they're 
very risk-averse they're not going to fund a  

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:35,210
study that is bad for their business Tom pommel a 
thief is a little bit about safety pay this your  

12
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,960
cheek for Jellicle cat escapement at the heart 
of this strategy of influence are the scientists  

13
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:49,190
who collaborate the industry paid you for this I 
received some compensation from my time as well  

14
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:59,540
as the others how much and the scientists who are 
targeted basically we're trying to shoot me down  

15
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:08,100
or discredit me I mean that's what you'd done 
means scientifically these efforts to go after  

16
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,760
the scientists and to discredit the scientists 
is a key element of a much larger strategy to  

17
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:22,800
just gum up the entire policy-making process 
between intimidation lies and manipulation we  

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,210
will uncover proof of a worldwide strategy 
we're hitting below the belt is allowed

19
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:38,010
feeling hungry now then it's time 
to eat tonight you are our guests  

20
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:43,620
to find out how ham is made we visited a factory

21
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,650
welcome to flowy mission one of the market leaders 
in France and one of the few to play the card of  

22
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:04,690
transparency the ham on your supermarket shelves 
starts out like this big lumps of pork meat

23
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:18,110
to have taste a little vegetable stock it all 
goes into a ham shaped mold and it's cooked

24
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,180
and the result perfectly pink rounded 
slices have you grasped the basics  

25
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,990
well let's rewind a little to see 
the detail that changes everything  

26
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,050
to obtain this fine ham there's 
another very important step

27
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:50,180
you have to inject the meat a machine with 
a dozen syringes injects a liquid into the  

28
00:03:50,180 --> 00:04:02,750
lumps of pork meat the liquid contains an 
essential additive factory manager Luhan  

29
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:10,040
Hulu shows us these yellow sacks contain 
a mixture of salt and sodium nitrite the  

30
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:24,560
additive p250 as a conservation Duchamp ball 
a little traditional pathogen you seem to need  

31
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,090
a cooler new characteristic donor chakra 
inversion oh and kahlúa so woozy of it and  

32
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:38,450
accepted me in fact he's telling us that the 
pretty pink of our ham isn't natural at all

33
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,810
it's thanks to sodium nitrite 
this additive fixes the pink  

34
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,330
of the meat during cooking otherwise 
ham would be the color of roast pork

35
00:04:52,330 --> 00:05:00,610
that's why food industrialists can't do without 
it as a processed meat producer would confirm  

36
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:08,830
venosus is wrong : that could help us get 
back to detail on that all over the Queen  

37
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,620
thus casino one just kept asking shook its 
apparent unclear supreme Jones has an ashram  

38
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:27,010
hungry mm-hmm for sm64 I sell descriptors and 
honesty to do something more personal esteem  

39
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:38,140
it is not only professor Lucifer in the create 
a boundary can be said to be on some problem  

40
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:45,100
let's sum up the hams pinkies are natural but 
without the pink it would be impossible to  

41
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:52,900
sell the big problem is that sodium nitrite 
is believed to be a danger to public health

42
00:05:54,760 --> 00:06:05,410
the additive is suspected of playing a role 
in the development of colorectal cancer one  

43
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:14,380
of the deadliest cancers in Europe the cause 
a phenomenon that takes place during digestion  

44
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:24,880
it's chemistry but we'll make it simple you 
swallow a piece of cured meat you think you're  

45
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,800
peacefully digesting it but what you don't 
know is the nitrite molecules are reacting  

46
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:36,640
with the meat proteins transforming them 
into very dangerous substances nitrosamine  

47
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:45,340
x' we went to the netherlands to learn 
more about the effects of this chemical  

48
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,710
reaction on our health to the Faculty 
of Medicine of Maastricht University

49
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,690
this is where the toxicologist professor Te'o 
de Kock works he's been interested in nitrites  

50
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:10,170
for years and by extension nitrosamine nitrogen 
means are known to induce damage in the large  

51
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:18,120
intestine so it can induce DNA breaks mutate 
cells into sort of pre cancer cells and that's  

52
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,130
of course something that you want to want 
to prevent them professor to cook notably  

53
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,570
wanted to find out what happens inside the 
body when we don't eat processed meat and  

54
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:34,020
when we eat a lot of it to do so he conducted an 
experiment with human guinea pigs like I'll know

55
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:41,790
for two weeks this student aid 300 grams 
have processed meat a day the equivalent  

56
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:51,090
of eight and a half sausages or seven slices 
of ham after 15 days we saw that the exposure  

57
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:57,270
to nitrosamine was considerably increased 
so it was up to between two and three fold  

58
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:03,240
increase as compared to the levels that we 
measured at start the researcher measured  

59
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,010
the impact on the organism of this chemical 
mutation of nitrites into nitrates amines

60
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:16,160
in his lab he tested the fecal water 
of big processed meat eaters like Arno

61
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:30,940
so what you see here is fecal water from 
four different individuals to see what  

62
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,700
happens inside the body the researchers mixed this  

63
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:39,070
fecal water with human cells the 
white deposited in the test tube

64
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:48,250
then they observed what happened to the cells 
you see that if you have no exposure you see  

65
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:54,910
that everything is intact so the material cells 
together but if you are exposed to nitrosamine  

66
00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:01,120
that induce breakages of the DNA you see this 
comet tail appearing so you see that here the  

67
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,480
damage is quite extensive so the more damage you 
have the more likely it is that a cell like this  

68
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,350
will eventually mutate into a pre cancer type 
of cell how long does it take for such a damage  

69
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,630
well this damage can be induced relatively 
quickly so in this essay when we isolate  

70
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,790
the cells and we only expose them for half an 
hour and then you already see the breakage of  

71
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:30,760
these DNA strands and so that's how fast it can 
happen and it can also happen not just in the lab  

72
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:40,210
here but also in an intact human body and if we 
stop using nitrites then what that would make a  

73
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,090
difference of potentially several thousands of 
colic and rectal cancer that's in Europe every  

74
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:55,210
year that's huge that's huge because colorectal 
cancer is a very frequent disease already small  

75
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:06,520
changes in a cancer risk can have a big impact 
in a large population thousands fewer cancers  

76
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:18,220
and therefore potentially fewer deaths just by 
suppressing nitrites but the food industry has  

77
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,560
a sledgehammer argument for justifying the 
use of nitrites it protects us from botulism

78
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:31,990
botulism is a form of food poisoning caused by 
bacteria that affect our central nervous system  

79
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:43,150
and can be deadly Gary right but there's a 
glitch in their argument there are already  

80
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:49,090
companies which do produce processed meats without 
nitrites and their customers are in fine form

81
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:05,920
if you happen to be in Copenhagen in Denmark 
just after the Little Mermaid and the case I'd  

82
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:13,930
promenade pop into a supermarket like we 
did there you'll find cured meats without  

83
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:23,770
nitrites and for those who's Danish has gone a 
bit rusty its food a new treat it's everywhere  

84
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:34,840
you can easily recognize it by its colour more 
brownish than pretty pink and the best known  

85
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,260
brand is produced 150 kilometres south of the 
capital in Denmark's biggest organic processed  

86
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:54,040
meat plant Hennigan the boss a biochemist 
started in nitrite free cured meats 25 years ago

87
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:03,250
since then the Danish health authorities haven't 
registered a single case of botulism caused by  

88
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:12,370
processed meat we do not have problems with this 
bacteria I would say for the last 50 years this  

89
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:20,450
has not been a reasonable topic in Western 
Europe that was a problem in meat industry  

90
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:28,400
hundred years ago where think we're not as clean 
as they are slaughterhouses were not as clean as  

91
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:36,410
they are today so no worry about bacteria now we 
have to worry about additives that might be into  

92
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:42,530
producing and if they are not necessary for some 
very good reasons we should not use them for you  

93
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:47,960
the cancer risk today is the main risk that's 
the main risk today definitely and and actually  

94
00:12:47,960 --> 00:13:03,230
it has been so for 30-40 years the main reason 
is that they are afraid but customers will not  

95
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:10,460
accept products which do not have the red color 
that they have been used to for many many years

96
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:21,100
Hanna Gao is one of the few food industry 
companies to do without nitrites and yet  

97
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,260
experts have been ringing alarm bells for years 
twenty-five years ago a European Union Health  

98
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:34,540
Report already recommended reducing the amounts 
of nitrite used in processed meats in 1999 this  

99
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:41,890
report even put forward banning its use altogether 
despite the increasing number of studies the  

100
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,080
European Commission still allows industrial food 
companies to add lots of nitrites to the products  

101
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:59,290
so we went to ask the Commissioner for health and 
food safety of former health minister in Lithuania  

102
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:11,680
a few questions one don't get the levels lower 
I would like to guarantee you that it is it is  

103
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:19,780
of course in hands of of institutions which are 
responsible to follow per se and to present to us  

104
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:28,000
final results notes what's always takes takes 
takes time and and and and the responsibility  

105
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,600
for over an hour the Commissioner attempted 
to pull the wool over our eyes in spite of  

106
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,000
all the reports by experts which for 25 years 
have warned the authorities about the dangers  

107
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,550
of nitrites all these studies you don't think 
they're enough you know all those studies are  

108
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:55,090
open that you see what's x22 to transparency six 
to possibility to have them to show to people that  

109
00:14:55,090 --> 00:15:01,900
we are ready to follow and to see and to do how 
to move for us as soon as possible transparency  

110
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:09,160
is good but decisions are better purchase order 
all decisions are in in lines of procedures can  

111
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:16,810
you imagine like like that decision to me if 
i will be king of the european union oh but I  

112
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:23,020
am NOT king of European Union I mean this story 
has been so going on for sole no no no sorry to  

113
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:31,240
say sorry I started this story shows that all 
standards are in safety line in this case why  

114
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,500
Europe lost against Denmark in the European Court 
of Justice in this night right story I don't know  

115
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:44,320
then content says it's gonna be right I would 
like to talk do I need more information because  

116
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:53,140
I am NOT one who knows everything so let's 
look at the facts mr. commissioner Denmark  

117
00:15:53,140 --> 00:16:00,430
wanted to limit the use of nitrites the European 
Commission was against it and in 2003 in court  

118
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:09,220
the Danes won in the name of the protection of 
public health about European Court decisions when  

119
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:16,480
European Court decision always show that public 
health is priority it means that digits hunter  

120
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,890
and Commissioner responsible public health is in 
better conditions and yet since this Court ruling  

121
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:32,740
EU regulations are just as lacks as ever from my 
point of view we must be more energetic asking  

122
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:41,590
industry to change the internal data formulate 
food to follow a figure to keep onboard public  

123
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:48,820
health priorities not profit absolute but 
it's but it of course it's it's takes time

124
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:57,930
time perfect that's just what the food 
industry wants and what it has built its  

125
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:11,550
strategy on for years because when it comes to 
nitrites industrialists have been waiting out  

126
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:20,990
the clock for 40 years forty years of scientific 
manipulation blackmail and intense lobbying so the  

127
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:28,790
meat business can carry on bringing home the bacon 
and it all began on the other side of the Atlantic  

128
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,530
if you think we're exaggerating listen to this

129
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,430
in the late 1970s nitrite was almost banned in 
the United States just after the publication of  

130
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:58,200
a large-scale study requested by the government 
a relationship between cancer and nitrate was  

131
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,280
proved suggested approved and a fairly strong 
one there were 2,000 rats involved in the study  

132
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,390
it's a very extensive study done by a well 
respected scientist the banning of nitrites  

133
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,490
was announced in the press but the American 
Meat Institute would bring out its big guns  

134
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:26,670
in his office overlooking the Capitol its 
President Richard Ling spoke out processed  

135
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:34,950
meats that contain nitrites are a big big 
thing the retail value of them about twelve  

136
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:41,160
and a half billion dollars about two-thirds 
of the hog production in the United States  

137
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:49,800
goes into cured meats and it presents a problem 
for our industry and for the government we're  

138
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:57,120
hopeful that a solution can be found armed 
with financial analysis the American Meat  

139
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,610
Lobby forced the government to back down the 
banning of nitrites would send pork prices  

140
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:10,590
plummeting and cause an apocalypse but it was 
a political event that would close the debate

141
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,960
in 1980 Ronald Reagan was elected president of  

142
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,660
the United States and guess 
who entered into government

143
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,140
Richard Ling the president of the 
American Meat Institute himself  

144
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,580
the idea of banning nitrite was forever buried

145
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:44,780
the experiment based study on 2000 rats ended 
up in the trashcan and after that the same fate  

146
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:55,970
would await every scientific publication calling 
nitrites into question if you're wondering how  

147
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,560
the interests of Industry can systematically 
win against what's at stake in public health  

148
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:08,420
the following will enlighten you 15 years after 
the victory of Ragan and the meat industrialists  

149
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:14,810
a new study shook America to the core if it's 
not one thing it's another a study finds a link  

150
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:20,060
between hotdogs now and cancer put yourself in 
the shoes of the average American Joe at the  

151
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:27,230
time you and your family are eating hot dogs 
at the shopping mall or in the street just as  

152
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:38,270
usual the effect was immediate in a matter 
of days hot dog sales fell by 8% and given  

153
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:42,920
the size of the American market that represented 
millions of dollars less for the food industry

154
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:54,990
the author of the hot dog study that 
caused sales to plummet was Susan  

155
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,540
Preston Martin she's now a retired 
scientist living near Los Angeles  

156
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,410
in a residential suburban setting 
straight out of an American soap

157
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:11,690
after several tense months of talks she agreed  

158
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:21,800
to see us but we had to insist 
right up until the last minute

159
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:34,220
the lady is very discreet it's from French TV mrs.  

160
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,210
Preston Martin yes I'm from 
Queens we go from French TV

161
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:50,930
hello with her discoveries on processed meats the 
researcher was the victim of a number of attacks  

162
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:56,690
but she agreed to look back at her work which 
showed a link between the excessive eating of  

163
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:06,530
hot dogs and certain rare cancers in children how 
did you find the relationship well just the way  

164
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:11,150
we always did when we did case control studies 
we started out with a group of children who had  

165
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,820
leukemia and compared them to group children who 
didn't have to keep me and we asked the mothers  

166
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:24,230
about what they fed the children and sure enough 
the kids with leukemia ate more hot dogs what did  

167
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,790
you think when you saw this strong relationship 
because it was quite a funny she was with hot  

168
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:38,180
dogs I was a little bit surprised and just 
reserved judgment it's just what happening me  

169
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:44,660
i watch this too and they find something they 
don't expect from that moment on for the food  

170
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:51,530
industrialists Susan Preston Martin became 
public enemy number one the meat Lobby they  

171
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,750
definitely didn't like what we were doing they 
were terribly upset and I could understand that  

172
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:05,600
you know their livelihood was making processed 
meats and they didn't want any anything coming  

173
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,980
out saying that those were not good for you 
basically we're trying to shoot me down or  

174
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:18,090
discredit me I mean that's what shoot done 
means scientifically what we discovered when  

175
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:27,120
much farther the scientists had never realized 
just whom she was dealing with America made the  

176
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:35,550
hotdogs famous Oscar Mayer gave it Diggity in 
the US the undisputed champion of supermarket  

177
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:46,860
sold hotdogs has always been Oscar Mayer a brand 
of the Kraft Foods Group a giant of the food  

178
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:56,850
industry so far no surprises but what's less 
known is that at the time and until 2007 Kraft  

179
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,880
was owned by Philip Morris the world's second 
largest tobacco company a lobby which went as  

180
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,400
far as lies and manipulation to defend its own 
interests notably in the big tobacco lawsuits  

181
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:15,570
of the 1990s you believe nicotine is not addictive 
I believe nicotine is not addictive yes I believe  

182
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:26,980
questioning proven scientific facts the strategy 
worked perfectly for years with tobacco so Philip  

183
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:37,930
Morris used it again to save Oscar Meyers hot dogs 
you understand how the multinational manipulated  

184
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:46,690
science to defend its investments and cured meats 
we headed to Northern California to San Francisco

185
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:57,480
this University library holds what are commonly 
known as the tobacco documents millions of  

186
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:09,780
internal tobacco industry documents our guide 
stanton glance has spent his life unraveling  

187
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:18,990
the cigarette makers strategies he particularly 
remembers one phrase used by a lobbyist in 1969  

188
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:28,530
doubters our product since it is the best means of 
competing with the body of fact that exists in the  

189
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:35,670
mind of the general public it is also the means 
of establishing a controversy for him everything  

190
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:46,080
is summed up in one word doubt and it was exactly 
like that by creating doubt that philip morris set  

191
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,400
out to discredit dr. preston martin study 
on processed meat and cancer in children  

192
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:03,840
the proof is there in the vast database 
of the tobacco documents by typing Susan  

193
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,630
Preston Martin you get hundreds of 
hits and all in the Philip Morris file  

194
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:20,090
the researchers named crops up regularly in the 
titles of memos letters and internal reports  

195
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:28,400
the multinational believed her study on hot dogs 
would reopen the debate surrounding nitrites from  

196
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,280
the 1970s so it paid scientists to go through 
her work with a fine-tooth comb in order to  

197
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:43,220
find any weak points even her contracts 
and grant pays past under the microscope  

198
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,360
basically anything that could be used against her 
and weakened her in the eyes of the government and  

199
00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:04,780
the press stanton Glantz only learned of this case 
through the documents we showed him the approaches  

200
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:11,110
that they used to attack the person doing the 
research linking cured meats with cancer were  

201
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:17,620
the standard things they do one is to go through 
her work with a fine-tooth comb and find every  

202
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:23,320
little thing they could possibly complain about 
and because the issues tend to be fairly technical  

203
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:28,690
you know if you're a politician if you're a 
reporter unless you're a highly specialized  

204
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,790
reporter all you hear is well this person said 
there was something bad and this other person  

205
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:40,000
said they didn't know what they were talking about 
and so these efforts to go after the scientists  

206
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:46,030
and to discredit the scientists there's a key 
element of a much larger strategy to just gum  

207
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:52,510
up the entire policy-making process to the 
point where nothing happens that translates  

208
00:27:52,510 --> 00:28:00,550
into hundreds of billions of dollars of sales and 
profits for them so the whole game is just slowed  

209
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:09,370
down in the documents on dr. Preston Martin other 
even more Machiavellian scenarios were studied  

210
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:18,490
here it was suggested that talks be held with the 
scientist and here a proposed seminar in order to  

211
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:31,240
lure her the aim to influence her and even shape 
the conclusions of her future studies the common  

212
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,930
point of these documents they all come from the 
same lobbying firm multinational business services  

213
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:45,310
inc already hired by philip morris to contest the 
effects of passive smoking on health and headed  

214
00:28:45,310 --> 00:29:02,230
by a certain gym tot see a master of influence 
amazingly in Washington the heart of American  

215
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:08,980
power this lobbyist is still well established as 
he never answered our requests for an interview  

216
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:27,070
we went to see him without an appointment with 
our documents in hand and a hidden camera yes  

217
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:40,450
she do you have an appointment no no I was just 
looking for him because I called from France

218
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:51,130
the good news American lobbyists can be 
welcoming we even managed to have Jim  

219
00:29:51,130 --> 00:30:15,280
taught C on his cell phone Jim can you hear me 
because you have set up a strategy to discredit  

220
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:46,750
her work for Oscar Mayer so I wanted to know 
if you like the welcoming lobbyists you love  

221
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:55,450
the angry one please leave now do I need to 
leave yes please leave I am ordering you out  

222
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:10,780
now get the [ __ ] now take the flagon [ __ 
] outta here and do not come back thank you

223
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:20,410
pity it had to end like that in the end mr. 
tot see did a great job well at least for the  

224
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:26,440
industrialists back then his auntie Preston Martin 
arguments were brought into the media spotlight  

225
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:34,300
by this health journalist on a major national TV 
channel a few days after the publication of the  

226
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:41,470
famous study let's get back to our hot dog study 
remember they asked the people did you eat a hot  

227
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:49,120
dog they didn't ask them did you put it in a bun 
did you put ketchup on it did you put mustard on  

228
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,440
it now you might be saying who really cares one 
way or the other but that's important because  

229
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,930
it may be that it's not the hot dog at all that's 
causing this increased risk of cancer maybe it's  

230
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:02,710
the bun maybe it's the ketchup maybe it's the 
mustard so you have to be careful when you read  

231
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:11,200
these studies not to say oh this causes this the 
powers that be didn't go any farther the 1970s  

232
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:18,580
nitrites file which could have resurfaced remained 
locked away you're probably wondering what Susan  

233
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:25,960
Preston Martin thinks the woman targeted by the 
lobby we showed her the documents and what upset  

234
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:33,220
her the most was seeing that fellow scientists 
had played along with the industrialists these  

235
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:41,170
professors will get paid a huge amount to do 
a review by in this case probably the American  

236
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:45,910
media Institute I mean thousands and thousands 
of dollars they probably get more from doing this  

237
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:53,680
kind of thing than they do from their regular jobs 
seeing your name like this in all these documents  

238
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:02,440
my goodness they I gave a lot of people a lot of 
work were you aware of this well I was aware that  

239
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:11,080
that the processed meat community was concerned 
but I'm not aware of all the extent of this  

240
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:21,930
twenty years on and she had turned the page 
not of interests anymore that's how the public  

241
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:27,570
awareness of science goes that's it of interest 
and then it's not of interest assuming you did  

242
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:32,730
all that work but today oh but it doesn't it 
doesn't matter I mean still in the literature  

243
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:38,700
and it may includes people in future and it has 
influence people in the past and that's fine  

244
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:48,480
but another scientist involved in the case 
has enjoyed a much more flourishing career  

245
00:33:48,480 --> 00:34:00,000
a scientist paid by the American Meat Institute 
to shoot down Susan Preston Martin's work david  

246
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:10,350
Clure felt today david kerfeld is head of the US 
government's nutrition program and he's invited  

247
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:16,800
all over the world for scientific conferences 
where he gives his experts point of view totally  

248
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:25,560
independently I'd like to introduce reasons why I 
think meat is important component of healthy diet

249
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:32,969
on that day he was in France speaking to 
scientists from around the world about meat  

250
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:38,189
and the link between processed meat and 
cancer in order to denounce backed up by  

251
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:47,070
PowerPoint the climate of fear panic and even 
hysteria and we know because we were there it  

252
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:51,810
was right at the start of our investigation 
when we barely knew about nitrites and had  

253
00:34:51,810 --> 00:35:00,090
the need of enlightened specialists to help 
us so there are new reviews published this  

254
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:08,130
year that say nitrite is not harmful and 
others that say it is harmful I don't think  

255
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:17,520
anybody really knows definitively what 
what the answer is a few months after  

256
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,110
this handshake when we had learned more about 
the industry of doubt bells started ringing

257
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:28,920
so we took advantage of our trip to 
America to ask him for another interview

258
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,700
only this time with a lot more cards of our sleeve  

259
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:47,450
do you remember being paid by the American 
Meat Institute no never no I was interested  

260
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:53,000
in scientists I called Susan Preston 
Martin yes do you know her I know who  

261
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,940
she is I do not know her personally do you 
remember writing a paper on her yes for the  

262
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:03,980
American Meat Institute no I found this and it 
was prepared for the American Meat Institute

263
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:19,460
okay I'm there this is something different yes 
I this was done 20 years ago roughly so I I had  

264
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:26,450
forgotten about that do you remember how much 
you were paid for this evaluation no I do not as  

265
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:31,250
I said it was 20 or 25 years ago you didn't know 
when you were working for the American entities  

266
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:43,340
you that Philip Morris was owning Oscar Mayer 
I'm not gonna say yes or no at this point in  

267
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:50,030
time because it's more than 20 years ago did you 
know that the tobacco strategy Muto was doubt is  

268
00:36:50,030 --> 00:37:00,470
our product no I never heard that no no doubt was 
your product - um that was not mine that was not  

269
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:08,630
my intent my intent was to do an evaluation if I 
had read these papers and found that there were  

270
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:14,930
not shortcomings in the papers that they were 
not deficiencies in the papers I don't think I  

271
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:19,640
would have criticized them but don't you think 
that your point of view would be stronger and  

272
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,680
your argument stronger if I hadn't found that you 
had been once paid by the American Meat Institute  

273
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:33,260
no I don't I don't think that would change it 
wouldn't change my point of view it might change  

274
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:40,640
your point of view that you tend to not believe 
what I'm saying because 25 years ago I got some  

275
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,500
amount of money that I don't remember we're making 
progress he can't remember how much but he does  

276
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:55,430
remember getting paid but you have to understand 
that the industry is a money-making business so  

277
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:04,340
they're very risk-averse they would not fund a 
study that someone were proposed to them that  

278
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:10,250
eating hot dogs increases the risk of childhood 
cancer why would they fund that you know they  

279
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:18,500
would only fund something that says proposes that 
childhood cancer is prevented by eating more hot  

280
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:25,700
dogs or there's no relationship you know they're 
they're not gonna fund a study that is bad for  

281
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:32,120
their business well elite he's honest much of the 
meat industry's lobbying depends on collaboration  

282
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:44,470
with paid scientists and that's still how things 
work during a conference on processed meats and  

283
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:52,480
cancer in Lyon a French scientist confirmed it 
Denis Coffey is a reference on the subject an  

284
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:59,270
internationally renowned expert he speaks and 
acts casually and doesn't balk at telling us

292
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,270
a sent us some names and photos of scientists 
he suspects of being close to the food industry

293
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:16,060
among them two Americans he came across at a 
conference on meat and cancer Angelou Kowski  

294
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:24,390
and Nathan Brian as we checked out these 
scientists profiles we discovered a document  

295
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:31,410
which should certainly never have been on the 
web an internal report issued by the American  

296
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:39,210
Meat Institute it lays out the strategy for 
influencing the decisions of high-profile  

297
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:50,790
organizations this organization is the ia 
RC the International Agency for research  

298
00:40:50,790 --> 00:41:00,510
on cancer this institution based in the old 
France is the worldwide reference on cancer

299
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:10,290
in 2006 ia RC scientists classified 
nitrites in the probably carcinogenic  

300
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:17,290
category of products group 2a 
and that was bad for business

301
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:27,850
so lobbyists are fighting to have 
this classification changed page 64  

302
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:33,100
of a document change in the IAR see 
nitrate nitrate classification from  

303
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:42,430
2a to 2b or possibly carcinogenic products 
the strategy has a name IAS each challenge

304
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,590
it notably involves the two scientists we were  

305
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:51,010
interested in andrew milk 
outski and nathan Bryan's

306
00:41:53,390 --> 00:42:05,720
armed with our brand-new file it was time to set 
off to meet the meat sectors heavyweights welcome  

307
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,300
to Nashville Tennessee the capital of country 
music and notably the hometown of Johnny Cash

308
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:18,890
it's here that the American Meat 
Institute is holding its annual  

309
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:26,420
conference in this huge building to 
be precise the meat industry in the  

310
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:32,760
US is very very big business all of 
the world's biggest players are here

311
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:44,520
Smithfield number one in Portland with a turnover 
of 14 billion dollars a year Cargill the giant  

312
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:53,520
with thirty three billion dollars a year in crude 
alone and Tyson the all divisions record holder  

313
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:01,410
this year will make with all of our divisions 
between beef pork poultry and prepared between  

314
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:13,140
37 billion and 40 billion dollars in revenue it's 
a very small company we checked it's over forty 1  

315
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:23,310
billion dollars after half an hour we spot a face 
in the crowd that rings a bell that woman they're  

316
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:31,140
tasting nibbles at every stand that's right page 
92 of the IAR sea challenge document here with the  

317
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,660
short hair the American Meat Institute senior 
vice president of public affairs Janet Riley

318
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:46,960
excuse me please sorry hello a lieutenant Ilia 
yes hello I'm sorry man go I'm working for  

319
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:54,100
force do unprocess Newton dancer and I have 
a question about the document I found it is  

320
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:04,840
this document do you know it I'm sorry dude 
okay no no actually I wasn't registered but  

321
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:11,500
I have some important question yes of course 
I have my journalist card just a question  

322
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:17,890
I wanted to know what do you know about the 
ER challenge the a our challenge here until  

323
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:25,270
I know what I'm doing it's about that right 
answer thank you no this is mine sorry okay  

324
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:37,870
so much for our interview having been escorted 
outside this is my press constant okay and been  

325
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:44,500
ordered to show ID we try one last time it's 
close dude it looks like what tobacco industry  

326
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,590
did for DK that's your opinion that's your 
opinion what we're doing is providing the  

327
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:56,400
science-based peer-reviewed evidence that our 
products are safe and you see right there but  

328
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,280
are you paying those scientists know you've 
got that camera rolling don't you luckily  

329
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:09,810
for such cases we always have a plan B on the 
list of ia RC challenge scientists there was  

330
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:24,840
one who agreed to see us the first on the list 
Andrew mil Kowski we head to Madison Wisconsin

331
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:37,510
this city in the north of the United 
States is home to Andrew mill Kowski  

332
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,730
and the company of hot dog king Oscar Mayer 
who we came across in the Preston Martin case  

333
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:57,520
the scientist worked for this company for 30 
years he now teaches at the University but  

334
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:04,210
he doesn't hide his proximity to the American 
meat lobby presented with our ia RC challenge  

335
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:12,700
documents he acknowledges everything or 
almost so did the meat industry paid you  

336
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:18,520
for this I received some compensation from 
my time as well as the others how much I

337
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:29,800
don't know thousands or tens of thousands of 
dollars small amounts small amounts can we have  

338
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:40,390
an idea no no defending nitrite seems to be a very 
big thing for industry looking for a substitutes  

339
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:53,800
has been attempted and was a a total failure 
something as chemically simple as nitrite and  

340
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:01,450
as unique as nitrite having a substitute has not 
been possible to anyone's ability but if there is  

341
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:08,020
a small risk of getting cancer don't you think 
it's important to try to find a solution that  

342
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:15,040
is where we disagree because I do not believe 
that that risk is is true you think there's no  

343
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:25,090
risk at all I think the risk is unquantifiable 
and unknown if it had indeed exists on hearing  

344
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:32,260
that we pulled this expression so for Andrew 
Malkowski the colorectal cancer the hundreds  

345
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:43,060
of studies on the dangers of nitrites none of 
it exists off you go nothing to do with it in  

346
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,620
the United States it's thanks to scientists like 
milk cows key that the meat industry has been able  

347
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:53,050
to cut another notch in its belt surprisingly 
in the health-conscious state of California

348
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:11,460
this imposing building is home to the state 
cabinet-level California Environmental Protection  

349
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:18,990
Agency we have an appointment with Sam Nelson 
deputy director for external and legislative  

350
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:34,530
affairs he'll show us a document that doesn't 
exist in any other American state so this is the  

351
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:42,810
lists it's a list of substances judged dangerous 
to man by the state of California to do business  

352
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:48,720
here manufacturers are banned from using these 
substances or they are obliged to warn consumers  

353
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:55,980
and it's very restrictive because there are over 
800 products on the list so good example that  

354
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:04,530
would be smoke there's other things like benzene 
that would be something you know we have common in  

355
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:11,790
things like exhaust and then here we have aspirin 
aspirin yeah it's a special note especially for  

356
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:17,040
pregnant women oh here's kind of a an odd one but 
you know things like breath and burn you know if  

357
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,880
you want to eat this go for it but be aware that 
you maybe don't want to eat it every single day so  

358
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:28,470
we don't find nitrate nitrate is not on the list 
it's been years since nitrites have been targeted  

359
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:34,050
but procedures have never been seen through when 
we believe the chemical meets the criteria for  

360
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:41,190
listing we post what's known as a notice of intent 
to list and that triggers a period in which people  

361
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:46,710
can submit public comments on whether it's desert 
does not meet the criteria we review the comments  

362
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:53,910
before making a final decision to complete listing 
regarding nitrites here are the comments that  

363
00:49:53,910 --> 00:50:02,250
swung the scales of the seven contributions six 
come from food industry lobbyists and with 31  

364
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:14,320
pages the winner is Andrew mill Kowski before the 
interview we show Sam Delson all our documents on  

365
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:23,920
mil Kowski the ia RC challenge and the attempts at 
influencer face was an avalanche of proof gathered  

366
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:30,190
during months of investigation he ends up taking 
out his cell phone to take photos however in  

367
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:45,460
answering our questions he seems less inspired 
we it's their business if they think that they  

368
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:53,140
can influence a decision beyond the signs but we 
we let the science do the talking do you think  

369
00:50:53,140 --> 00:51:04,570
it might happen that sometimes you are manipulated 
by the industries we do our best to make decisions  

370
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:14,830
based solely on the science regardless of whatever 
pressure or attempts at persuasion may be made by  

371
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:26,260
any outside group okay California will re-examine 
the dangers of nitrites but not before next year

372
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:36,980
for the lobby it's a mini victory time gained 
and profits not lost in Europe a new study on  

373
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:44,150
nitrites was expected in December 2015 almost 
a year later it still has not been published
