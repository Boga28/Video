1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,502
-Here you are. Thanksgiving.
Thank you for doing this.

2
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:05,638
This means a lot to us.
-Well, my pleasure. My pleasure.

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:06,706
-Do you enjoy Thanksgiving?

4
00:00:06,706 --> 00:00:08,674
-I love --
It's the greatest holiday.

5
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:12,145
You know, of course, you have to
mix in the subjugation

6
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,848
of the Native American culture
that is just so depressing.

7
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:19,952
You know, what happened --
you have to acknowledge that.

8
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:24,057
So, we're happy and we're --
Everyone loves Thanksgiving,

9
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:29,261
but let's remember
it's an absolute horror.

10
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:31,631
It's a horror of what happened.

11
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,034
But the warmth of it
is irresistible.

12
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:38,638
The warmth and
the horror of this day.

13
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,473
-So it is a combination.

14
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,208
-Like life itself.
-Like life itself.

15
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,377
-Life itself.
Warm and wonderful.

16
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:48,747
Underneath, horror and tragedy.

17
00:00:48,747 --> 00:00:51,551
-Do you stay home?
Do you have to travel?

18
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,252
Do you have to --
-I will be home.

19
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:56,355
And I am home. This is home.
-Yeah.

20
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:57,656
-I live in New York.

21
00:00:57,656 --> 00:00:59,559
And one of the things I like --

22
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,162
Here's a nice thing that people
do, especially in holidays.

23
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:05,298
You know, you have
that person, the relatives

24
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:07,800
or somebody you really like,
and when they leave,

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,036
you say, "Travel safe."

26
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:11,204
Travel safe."

27
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,905
And I think that's nice,
isn't it?

28
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:14,774
It's like you know what
they're saying.

29
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:16,676
They're saying,
"I care about you.

30
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:17,743
-Yeah.

31
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,946
-But, of course,
you can't travel safe.

32
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,514
You can't --
You know, you drive.

33
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,782
You get on a plane.

34
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,118
I mean, maybe if you're
at a train crossing

35
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,520
and the thing's
coming down and you think,

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,655
"I think I can beat this train."

37
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:29,855
You go, "Oh, wait a minute.

38
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:32,425
They told me, 'Travel safe.'
I'm not --"

39
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,794
-"I'm not gonna risk it."
-Yeah. "I'm not gonna do that."

40
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:37,129
And the other nice thing about
"travel safe" is --

41
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:40,967
you don't notice
when people don't say it.

42
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,069
Like, if you don't like somebody
and they're leaving,

43
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:47,840
you don't go, "Travel."

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,509
Because you would notice that.

45
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,543
They'd get out the door
and they'd go,

46
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:51,911
"That was weird.

47
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,815
They didn't mention my safety.
That hurts my feelings.

48
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,583
Yeah, I don't think
people like me.

49
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,853
Next train crossing,
I'm going for it," you know?

50
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:03,255
-But the whole family's there?
-Yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:04,990
Family, kids, food.

52
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,192
-I love talking to you
about kids,

53
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,494
because I have two girls
going to school now,

54
00:02:08,494 --> 00:02:09,627
and raising kids and --

55
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:12,999
-Right. And you're in it, right?
-Oh, I am in it.

56
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,169
-You're living their life.
-Yeah.

57
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:19,272
-This is the part
I didn't think was gonna happen.

58
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,942
I thought, "I grew up.
I'm done with that.

59
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:24,744
I went to school.
I'm done with that."

60
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,478
-Yeah.
-No, you're not done with it.

61
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:29,248
You've got to do it
all over again now.

62
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,616
Do it all over again.

63
00:02:30,616 --> 00:02:33,086
Let me tell you --
This is a true story, okay?

64
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,622
When I grew up,
when I was a little kid,

65
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:39,358
my mother would -- I don't know.

66
00:02:39,358 --> 00:02:40,759
She wanted me to be outside or

67
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:43,062
she wanted me to be
able to play,

68
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:46,265
so she would tie a rope
around my waist

69
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:50,636
and tie the other end
to the garage door --

70
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:53,339
I'm not making this up --

71
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,175
so that I could play
in the driveway.

72
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,844
And then she went back
in the house.

73
00:02:58,844 --> 00:03:03,216
Now, there's a lot of
weird parts to this, right?

74
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:08,420
-I mean, I kind of --
-It's like the thousand clowns.

75
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,723
♪♪
Yeah.

76
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:14,660
-So, you're tied to the --
-I was tied to the garage.

77
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,328
Now, of course, as soon as
she went in the house,

78
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:18,131
I untied it and
went about my business.

79
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,466
You know, it's not hard
to untie a rope.

80
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,270
But that was child-rearing.
-You're in the radius.

81
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,572
-Yes. She felt like --
I think kids --

82
00:03:26,572 --> 00:03:28,574
When we grew up,
we're like parakeets.

83
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:31,010
As long as I don't lose
the parakeet,

84
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,713
I'm doing my job, you know?

85
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,215
I am parenting this child
if they're still here.

86
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,618
-If they're still in the cage.
-Yeah. That's it. That's it.

87
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,719
-And Jessica's doing well,
your wife?

88
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,489
-Yes, Jess is doing great.

89
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,858
-Is it -- 'Cause we've had --

90
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,628
-We socialize sometimes, you and
your beautiful wife, Nancy.

91
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:52,264
-Yeah, we talk, and I kind of
find that, sometimes,

92
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:55,468
we drift off into
doing a comedy bit,

93
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:56,936
and especially when
I get with you.

94
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:59,072
I start talking --

95
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,208
-Comedians are like -- They're
like Pekinese or Shar-Peis.

96
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,444
They're just some
weird breed that they see

97
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:07,847
another of their breed,
they get very excited.

98
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:10,582
You know, "Oh, it's one of me.
It's one of me."

99
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:11,784
You know, right?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,386
Yeah, and I start going,
"Is this funny?

101
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,455
Is that good?"
-Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,858
-And I feel like, you know,
when we tell jokes,

103
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,561
when I've seen your act, too,
you go, "Oh, my wife does this."

104
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,797
-Yes. Now, I use my wife
in my act.

105
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,532
I don't think you were ever
in this situation,

106
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,201
where you say something
about Nancy

107
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,868
that's absolutely not true.

108
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,870
-I think I -- Yeah, sometimes.
-Do you?

109
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,306
-That's, like, a comedy --

110
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,309
-Like, when you're doing --
You just say -- Can you say --

111
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,244
Is she fine with you saying
whatever you want

112
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,246
about her when
you're doing your comedy?

113
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,581
-It depends.
-Okay, that's a "no."

114
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:45,985
That's a "no."
That is not...

115
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:47,786
-Well, I mean,
she understands, I think,

116
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:49,455
that there's comedy wife
and there's --

117
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,523
-Does she?

118
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,925
'Cause I think
comedians's wives have --

119
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:55,060
It's a little tough
for them sometimes.

120
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,762
I do a thing about the --

121
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,499
You know in your car,
the dual-zone temperature?

122
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:00,632
-Yeah.

123
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:01,834
-Like, "Gee, I wonder
who invented that.

124
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,036
I wonder who thought,
"That might come in handy

125
00:05:04,036 --> 00:05:07,273
to shut somebody up about,
you know, 'I'm freezing.

126
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,975
I'm roasting.
It's blowing on me.'"

127
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,009
-Yeah.
-You know?

128
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,243
-Yeah.

129
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:13,879
-So, I tell -- It's a whole bit
about my wife

130
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,948
and how she gave
birth without anesthesia

131
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,450
but can't handle
a waft of air 3 degrees

132
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,554
off her optimum
desired temperature, you know?

133
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,223
-Yeah.

134
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,792
-And, by the way,
how do they keep

135
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:31,063
the different-temperature
air molecules from commingling?

136
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:33,532
Can they actually do that?

137
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:34,967
I think they can,
'cause that's how I get

138
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,035
my coffee in the morning.

139
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,537
I like to get it black
on the left side,

140
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,770
and I got cream and sugar
on the right.

141
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,872
They can do it.

142
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,006
-They can do anything?
-They can do it.

143
00:05:41,006 --> 00:05:42,175
-They can do any of that stuff.

144
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,876
-But has Nancy ever
gotten upset with you

145
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:45,878
about something
you've said, comedically?

146
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:49,682
-I think she might have --
No, I don't mean -- It depends.

147
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,418
-Yeah, it depends.
That's a "yes."

148
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:54,286
No further questions,
Your Honor.

149
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,389
-Yeah, but I go, "No,
it's not talking about you."

150
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:57,623
-No. It's made up.

151
00:05:57,623 --> 00:05:59,792
Jessica never complains
about the temperature,

152
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,827
but you have to use her.

153
00:06:01,827 --> 00:06:04,063
You're here to work
on the comedy.

154
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:06,599
Everybody in the family has to
help with the comedy, right?

155
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,233
-That's what I say.
I totally agree.

156
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,970
Everyone's in on it.
-Right. Everyone's in. Right.

157
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,539
-Comedy kids.
-They're comedy kids.

158
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,773
Everyone's a prop.
-You're part of the act.

159
00:06:14,773 --> 00:06:17,610
-It's a family business, right?

160
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,878
-It really is.
-Yeah.

161
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,813
-I was talking to you about

162
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:23,149
I had a weird outfit on
when we had dinner.

163
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,817
-Yes.
-And it was --

164
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:30,289
-And I was talking about how one
of the problems of mature men,

165
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:33,092
like ourselves, is the jeans.

166
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:38,331
There is no jeans
for older men that nobody --

167
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,932
that people think look good.

168
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:42,101
You just don't look --
There's no jeans.

169
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,102
There's nothing you can do.

170
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,437
-You think you reach
a certain age --

171
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,538
-You reach an age where
it's just bad.

172
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:50,642
It's bad. You look bad.
-Men shouldn't wear jeans.

173
00:06:50,642 --> 00:06:53,479
-If you try and look cool,
is that gonna work?

174
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,881
-I don't know.
-No. It's not going to work.

175
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,049
-I know, but --

176
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,585
-Do you -- If you saw me
in really cool jeans,

177
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,555
you would think,
"What an idiot," right?

178
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:07,559
But if I'm wearing lame jeans --
There's no answer to this.

179
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:11,063
You can't wear --
Now, we're still wearing jeans,

180
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,466
but we don't look good.

181
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:17,269
And nobody's gonna tell us.
Go ahead. Show off some jeans.

182
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,671
You got a picture
of us in jeans?

183
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:23,709
-Gosh, you really got
a good photo of me here.

184
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,678
Yeah, I kind of --
-Yeah. See? Those jeans.

185
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:30,449
Look at those shoes.
You look ridiculous.

186
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:31,550
Look at me.
I don't look good either.

187
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,884
I don't know what I'm --

188
00:07:32,884 --> 00:07:35,053
-Well, don't worry about the --
The shoes are a mistake.

189
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:36,188
I was trying to --
I don't know --

190
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:37,756
bring the moccasin back
or something.

191
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:39,191
-Right.

192
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:43,362
But I know I don't look cool and
I know there's nothing I can do.

193
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,965
-I think this might be
my last year for jeans.

194
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:49,034
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

195
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:50,135
But I'll do it
and I'll celebrate.

196
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:52,738
-Well, all dads dress
in the style

197
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:58,143
of the last good year of
their lives, right?

198
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:02,248
That's how they dress.
-Oh, my God.

199
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,586
-Yeah.
-Oh, my goodness.

200
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:10,589
I was there -- We were having
dinner, and I was wearing --

201
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:12,257
I was wearing just,
like, a weird --

202
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,326
Like, just a regular
golf shirt or something,

203
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,727
a burgundy golf shirt,

204
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:18,731
and I had burgundy checkered
pants or something and sneakers.

205
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,365
And we had dinner, and
it was great.

206
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:22,067
And then, at the end of
dinner, you go,

207
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,604
"So, what's with the outfit?"

208
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,772
And I go --
It was just me and you.

209
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,774
You weren't doing it
for anyone else, just me.

210
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,209
And I go,
"What are you talking about?

211
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,543
It's, like, a normal outfit.

212
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:33,578
I'm just wearing a golf shirt
and checkered pants."

213
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:36,581
You go, "No, no."

214
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:40,919
You go,
"No one wears this outfit."

215
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:43,321
Someone does wear it.
I'm wearing this outfit.

216
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:49,228
And you go, "No, you look like
a mannequin from Nordstrom's."

217
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:50,396
Oh, my God.

218
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,565
That made me laugh for like --
Oh, my gosh.

219
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,833
That is the funniest thing ever.

220
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,037
I want to talk quick about
your residency at the Beacon.

221
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,271
-Oh, yes.

222
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:00,606
I'm going back to
the Beacon Theatre.

223
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,709
-I'm so excited for this.
-I love that theater.

224
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,944
-What a cool thing.

225
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:10,182
-Yeah. It's like -- You know,
I'm, like, at this point

226
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,753
where I just want to be
in those places where comedy

227
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:18,024
just feels and fits, you know,
'cause when we're starting out,

228
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,259
we do comedy anywhere
anyone will pay us.

229
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,427
-Yeah.

230
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:23,796
-And now, you know,
I want it to be, like,

231
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,765
in that test-tube, perfect
chemical environment.

232
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:27,933
-Acoustically and --

233
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,402
-Yeah, acoustically
and the vibe of the room.

234
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:34,506
And, of course,
it's, you know, New York, so --

235
00:09:34,506 --> 00:09:37,109
-People, tourists come here, but
it's perfect to, like, go see --

236
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,310
What do you do it?

237
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,478
Like once a month?

238
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:42,080
-Yeah, like once a month,
starting next year.

239
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,416
-I can't wait for this.
-Oh, me too. I'm so excited.

240
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,917
I love that theater.

241
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:48,554
-I'm happy you're doing that,
'cause I'll be showing up there

242
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:52,658
in my mannequin outfit.

243
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,526
Let's talk about,
also, the Netflix --

244
00:09:54,526 --> 00:09:55,861
-Would you ever
come and work with me?

245
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,130
You know, Steve Martin
has worked with me.

246
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,132
Would you ever come
and work with me there

247
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,067
as just a surprise drop-in?

248
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,802
-I haven't done stand-up
in so long.

249
00:10:03,802 --> 00:10:05,036
-Oh, really?
You don't have a set?

250
00:10:05,036 --> 00:10:07,873
You don't have 15 minutes?
You can't do 15 minutes?

251
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,042
Come on.
Bring your guitar.

252
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,176
-I bring the guitar and props?

253
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,811
-Bring the guitar and the props

254
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,748
and the garbage bag
full of stuff.

255
00:10:16,748 --> 00:10:18,149
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

256
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,118
-I'll do it.
-Surprise drop-in.

257
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:21,420
You're gonna do
one of the dates.

258
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,188
Okay, great.
-15 minutes?

259
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:24,856
-Whatever you want,
whatever you got.

260
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:26,425
-Let's say 5 to 10.

261
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:31,730
-I did half of
your monologue tonight.

262
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,800
-All right, all right.
Deal, deal, deal, deal, deal.

263
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,071
The new show that you are
producing on Netflix.

264
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:43,342
It's called "Stand-up and Away."
-Yeah. It's Brian Regan.

265
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:46,211
I always wanted Brian Regan
to have his own show.

266
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,114
-Me too.
-'Cause we love him.

267
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,282
He's the funniest guy.
-I love Brian Regan.

268
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,017
-But you get to a point --
Again, it's one of those things.

269
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:56,621
I can't deal with the jungle of
network television

270
00:10:56,621 --> 00:11:00,025
and the layers of people,
and we're gonna talk about it

271
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,260
and all that stuff.

272
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,061
So, I said, "Let me
bring you to Netflix.

273
00:11:03,061 --> 00:11:04,830
They will do it right.

274
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,565
They will --"
You know, so I brought him in.

275
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,035
I said, "Let's just make
a show with Brian."

276
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:11,403
But I'm not really doing
the show, okay?

277
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:14,840
I want to be clear that --
I don't want credit, really.

278
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,475
I just brought Brian
there and I said,

279
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,377
"You've got to do
a show with this guy."

280
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,744
Like, at the end of
your show tonight,

281
00:11:19,744 --> 00:11:20,780
there are credits, right?

282
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,913
-Correct.

283
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:24,116
-And there are
executive-producer credits

284
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:27,153
of people who do
absolutely nothing on this show.

285
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,487
Is that correct?

286
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:33,358
Nothing.
They contribute nothing.

287
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:37,429
-No.
-You're on-camera.

288
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:40,265
Tell America
that there are people

289
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:44,870
taking credit for this show
and doing nothing.

290
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,205
Admit it.
-It depends.

291
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:52,811
-It --
[ Laughter ]

292
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:56,815
Our thanks to a legend,
Jerry Seinfeld,

293
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:57,950
everybody, right there.
