1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,110
- Hello everyone and welcome
back to English with Lucy.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:06,070
Today I am going to bring you

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:10,940
25 Sentences for Daily Conversational Use.

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,600
When we have conversations,

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,070
we often use the same sentences
again and again and again.

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,610
So I've got some alternatives for you,

7
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,310
some new smart sentences that
you may not have heard before,

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,670
but they're definitely
ones that we use a lot,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,090
especially in the UK and
around the world as well.

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,080
Before we get started,

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,060
I would just like to thank
the sponsor of today's video,

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,750
it is italki.

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,730
If you haven't heard of italki before,

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,010
it's a huge online database of teachers

15
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,940
who give one to one video
lessons, 24 hours a day.

16
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,370
You can learn English and
over 130 other languages

17
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,660
from anywhere in the world.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,300
It's an incredibly affordable
way of learning a language

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,010
much cheaper than an offline
tutor or a language Academy.

20
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,210
So many of my friends students message me

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,670
and ask me how they can meet and talk

22
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,940
with English speakers,

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,120
italki is the perfect option for you.

24
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,850
Because not only do they
have qualified teachers,

25
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,230
they also have community teachers

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,450
who will practise conversation with you.

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,840
They've given me an
offer to pass on to you.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,380
You can get $10 worth of
italki credits for free

29
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,720
in your student wallet,

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,810
48 hours after making your
first purchase of any amount.

31
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,950
That could be a free lesson.

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,150
Just click on the link in the
description box to sign up.

33
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,410
Right, let's get started with the lesson.

34
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,610
Firstly, let's discuss
the phrases we can use

35
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,460
when we meet someone that
we either do or do not know.

36
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,320
These are different situations.

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,270
The first phrase, it's
nice to bump into you.

38
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,650
It's nice to bump into you.

39
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,690
Now if you don't know someone

40
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,090
you can say it's nice to bump into you,

41
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,100
and if you do know someone,
you've met them before,

42
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,230
you can say it's nice to bump
into you again, another time.

43
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,380
Now, the literal meaning
of to bump into someone

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,240
is to collide.

45
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,020
I bumped into someone at the supermarket

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,670
and dropped my water for example.

47
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,470
However, in this instance,
to bump into someone means

48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,030
to meet someone unexpectedly.

49
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,420
For example, I might say,

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,290
I bumped into your mum
at the swimming pool.

51
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,330
I unexpectedly met your mum.

52
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,970
Now the next one, number two

53
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,710
is a phrase that we would use

54
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,230
if we don't know someone,
where haven't met them before,

55
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,410
but we have maybe heard of them before

56
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,260
or we have communicated
with them digitally.

57
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,460
Maybe we've been talking over
email, something like that.

58
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,850
It is, it's great to
finally meet you in person.

59
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,350
It's great to finally meet you in person.

60
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,340
I say this all the time
when I meet other YouTubers,

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,078
people that I've seen online,

62
00:02:52,078 --> 00:02:53,688
and then I go to a YouTube event

63
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:56,920
Ah, it's so nice to
finally meet you in person.

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,180
Now number three is speak of the devil.

65
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,330
Speak of the devil.

66
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,360
And this has a very specific usage.

67
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,550
This is said when a person appears

68
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,920
just after being mentioned.

69
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,540
For example, if I'm talking to a colleague

70
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,530
about someone's excellent presentation,

71
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,610
and then that person appears,

72
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,310
I could say, "speak of the devil,

73
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,310
we were just talking about
your excellent presentation."

74
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,860
This can be a great way to
make someone new feel included,

75
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,240
especially if you have
been complimenting them

76
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,630
behind their back.

77
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,740
Number four, another one to use

78
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,880
if you haven't met someone before,

79
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,960
but you want to pay
them a nice compliment.

80
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,620
You can say, I've heard so much about you.

81
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,620
I've heard so much about you.

82
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,470
And a really good response to this is

83
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,840
all good things, I hope.

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,480
All good things, I hope,

85
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,850
or all positive, I hope.

86
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,580
And the last one number five,

87
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,863
this is a nice way of saying
I don't know who you are

88
00:03:54,863 --> 00:03:55,696
(laughs)

89
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:58,270
so please introduce yourself to me.

90
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,500
It is, I don't think we
crossed paths before,

91
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,760
I don't think we've crossed paths before.

92
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,610
To cross paths is to
meet someone by chance.

93
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,730
And if we haven't crossed paths before,

94
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,940
well we've never met.

95
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,477
But I think it's a little
bit nicer than saying,

96
00:04:13,477 --> 00:04:14,310
"Who are you?

97
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,760
I don't know who you are."

98
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,630
I don't think we've crossed paths.

99
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,640
Okay, next section.

100
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,940
Let's say for now that
you have met someone

101
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,150
that you do know,

102
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,960
you're going to want
to catch up with them.

103
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,710
And to catch up with someone

104
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,630
is to talk about
everything that's happened

105
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,610
since you last saw each other.

106
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,860
So we have number six,

107
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,970
which is how is everything going?

108
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,390
How is everything going?

109
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,860
If you can't specifically
remember what they've been doing,

110
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,190
how is everything going,

111
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,490
is a great way to let them
lead the conversation.

112
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,510
It gives them room to open up.

113
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,930
This might refer to
their family, their work,

114
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,030
their personal life and
romantic life, who knows.

115
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,210
But you can let them lead the conversation

116
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,970
because they decide what everything is.

117
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,370
We also have number seven,

118
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,120
which is, what have you been up to?

119
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,280
What have you been up to?

120
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,010
This is a really friendly phrase.

121
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,610
I've used this before.

122
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,380
I've taught it before in my
Stop Saying How Are You video.

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,340
If you are up to something,

124
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,420
it means that you are doing
something mischievous.

125
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,160
You're doing something troublesome.

126
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,020
This phrase is very warm and friendly.

127
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,390
It's saying you know what
trouble have you been causing?

128
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,690
What have you been doing?

129
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,650
It's something that we
use a lot with children

130
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,483
or with animals.

131
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:31,797
I often say to my dog,

132
00:05:31,797 --> 00:05:34,000
"what have you been up to Diego?"

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,320
'Cause I know he's been
doing something mischievous.

134
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,400
But now we use it with friends as well.

135
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,550
It's very casual,

136
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,670
but it's not inappropriate
for professional situations,

137
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,700
if you know the person quite well.

138
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,740
What have you been up to?

139
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,150
Oh, not much, I've not been up too much.

140
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,110
We also have number eight, which is

141
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,120
what have I missed?

142
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,370
Fill me in.

143
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,220
So if you haven't caught up
with someone for a while,

144
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,730
this is a good way to ask them,

145
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,670
what has happened since you last spoke.

146
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,800
To fill someone in,

147
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,800
is to give someone missing information,

148
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,240
to inform someone more
fully of a situation.

149
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,210
So if I'm saying, fill me in,

150
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,550
I'm saying, tell me all
this missing information.

151
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,900
Another good one is we've
got so much to catch up on,

152
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,120
we've got so much to talk about.

153
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,450
So much has happened since
we last saw each other.

154
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,800
Now, number 10 is one that you can use

155
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,940
if you've seen or met
someone that you know

156
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,990
you need to spend a long time talking to,

157
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,690
but it's not the right time.

158
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,960
It is, there's so much to say,
but I can't go into it now.

159
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,780
I can't go into it now.

160
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,100
To go into something is to
discuss or explain something

161
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,240
in a careful and detailed way.

162
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,050
This implies that there are
lots and lots of details,

163
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,220
too many for now.

164
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,380
Maybe it would be impolite to talk a lot,

165
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,930
maybe there are some people around

166
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,360
that shouldn't hear what
you're talking about.

167
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,060
It's a good one to use
to have up your sleeve.

168
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,750
That means to have something
ready for later use.

169
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,940
Right, so we've discussed
talking to people

170
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,590
that we have met before,

171
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,310
now what should we do with people

172
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,870
that we haven't met before?

173
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,280
We should get to know them,

174
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,420
we should ask some good
open-ended questions

175
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,810
to get them talking.

176
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,030
Often we want to ask people,
how did you get your job?

177
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,200
How did you end up working here?

178
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,030
That's not so polite.

179
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,790
So a really good alternative
is number 11 which is,

180
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,540
how did you get into X?

181
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,130
How did you get into marketing?

182
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,090
To get into something in this context

183
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,640
is to become involved with.

184
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,460
How did you get involved in marketing?

185
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,300
Another nice way of
getting to know someone

186
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,160
is to ask them what they do for fun.

187
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,470
And in American English especially,

188
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,440
what do you do for fun is
a very common question.

189
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,980
I would say it's not so common in the UK,

190
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,780
but we do see it in
movies and TV shows a lot.

191
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,170
We would say something
more along the lines of

192
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,860
what do you do outside of work?

193
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,260
Or what do you do when you're not working?

194
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,590
I think this is nicer than asking someone

195
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,740
what do you do for fun?

196
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,930
'Cause I know when someone
asks me what I do for fun,

197
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,560
I think "Oh God,

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,960
I'm not that fun a person.

199
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,793
I like running.

200
00:08:10,793 --> 00:08:13,194
Will they think that's fun enough?"

201
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:15,310
So yeah, just what do you
do when you're not working?

202
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,980
What do you do outside of work?

203
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,010
Another good thing to
talk about is motivation,

204
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,730
and we want to know what motivates people.

205
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,667
But instead of just simply saying,

206
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,050
"What motivates you?"

207
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,400
You could say, "What makes you tick?"

208
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,090
What really makes you tick?

209
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,659
And this is sort of asking
what are you passionate about?

210
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,469
What keeps you going?

211
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,500
For example, helping my
students gain confidence

212
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,750
really makes me tick.

213
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,597
Another similar one is,

214
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:43,530
"What gets you out of bed in the morning?"

215
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,923
What do you get up for?

216
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,080
(laughs)

217
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,340
Or quite a fun and cheeky one is,

218
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,550
what floats your boat?

219
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,270
What brings you joy?

220
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,260
This comes from the phrase,

221
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,470
whatever floats your boat.

222
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,610
And this is something that we say

223
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,650
when somebody says they like something

224
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:01,610
and we it's a bit strange.

225
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,443
So for example,

226
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:05,660
if someone says they like
running marathons every weekend,

227
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,510
I might say, "Whatever floats your boat,

228
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,082
not my thing, but good for you."

229
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:11,270
(laughs)

230
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,710
The question, what floats your boat,

231
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,930
is a variation of that.

232
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,130
Now when we meet people,

233
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,350
and we have a really
really good conversation,

234
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,340
the next step is to
ensure further contact,

235
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,510
to create further contact.

236
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,410
But we don't just want to
say, "What's your number?

237
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,630
I would like to talk again."

238
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,380
Although, I quite like
the direct approach.

239
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,580
There are some other ways of
doing this, like number 16,

240
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,570
I'd love to carry this on at a later date.

241
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,710
Or I'd love to carry
this on at another time.

242
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,110
And this is just basically saying,

243
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,330
I would love to continue
this conversation.

244
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,530
So you're sort of stopping
them they're, saying pause,

245
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,400
but let's continue this later on.

246
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,720
Whether it's tomorrow or this evening.

247
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,350
Another good one to use

248
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,260
if you can see that a
conversation is coming to an end,

249
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,740
maybe it's like a break in a conference,

250
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,290
you know that the next lecture is starting

251
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,440
but you still want to make sure

252
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,610
you remain in contact with this person,

253
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,277
you could say something like,

254
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:13,800
"I feel like we've got so
much more to talk about."

255
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,140
And this is a really nice one

256
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,810
because it's sort of passing the baton.

257
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,160
It's passing the responsibility
over to the other person.

258
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,057
It gives them the opportunity to say,

259
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,530
"Well, let's stay in touch.

260
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,480
Let's exchange contact details."

261
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,340
It's nice if you don't know
if they want to stay in touch,

262
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,280
you're kind of testing the water.

263
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,740
If they say yeah, let's
stay in touch, brilliant.

264
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,610
If they don't, well there we are.

265
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,420
The next one number 18 is
to discuss something over

266
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:44,600
a consumable, a food or a beverage.

267
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,640
We should discuss this over lunch.

268
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,450
We should chat over coffee.

269
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,010
We should talk over dinner.

270
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,220
If you think about it

271
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,560
using the word over is quite appropriate

272
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,380
because normally, two people
having a meeting at dinner,

273
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,620
we are speaking over the top of the food.

274
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,550
Another very simple one
very casual number 19 is,

275
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,570
we should do this again.

276
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,980
We should do this again.

277
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,090
It's implying we should
see each other again.

278
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,520
And the last one number 20,

279
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,090
if you want to be very direct

280
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,160
and give your contact details,

281
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,250
you can say, "Here's my
email or here's my number.

282
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,700
Drop me a line and we'll
sort something out."

283
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,460
Drop me a line and we'll
sort something out.

284
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,530
So to drop someone a line
is to write a brief message.

285
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,730
So it could be a text, WhatsApp, an email.

286
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,030
And to sort something out
is to organise something.

287
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,210
So we will arrange another meeting.

288
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,760
And the last set of phrases.

289
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,200
For me, the hardest part
of any conversation,

290
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,560
leaving the conversation.

291
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,260
It's just so awkward, isn't it?

292
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,700
If you don't have much time,

293
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,267
you can use 21 which is,

294
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:51,460
Oh, I'm a bit pressed for time.

295
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,510
I'm a bit pressed for time.

296
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,150
This is a nice way of saying

297
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,220
I don't have any time, I need to go.

298
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,830
Or number 22,

299
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,050
Right, need to make a move.

300
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:07,050
Now (laughs) in the UK,
we always say right,

301
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,330
and sort of clap our hands
or clasp them together

302
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,110
when we're about to begin to leave.

303
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,410
When we're about to
announce our departure.

304
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,010
To make a move is to begin
to leave or just to leave.

305
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,390
I'm going to make a move,

306
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,300
I'm going to leave.

307
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,680
It's just a nicer way of saying it

308
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,920
because we're beating around the bush,

309
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,360
we're avoiding the topic.

310
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,030
I don't wanna say I'm leaving,

311
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,470
I'm going to say I'm making a move.

312
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,210
Another very similar one is,

313
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,660
I'm going to have to get going.

314
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,220
I'm going to have to get going

315
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,470
or I need to get going.

316
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,340
To get going again, it's
like to make a move.

317
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,160
It is to begin to leave.

318
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,320
But by saying I have to, it's
implying I don't want to,

319
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,780
I just have to.

320
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,420
It's not my choice, but I need to.

321
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,620
Now a really nice one,

322
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,250
a really interesting, maybe
slightly manipulative one

323
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,640
but I learned it from someone
that I really respect.

324
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,690
It's an older woman in my village

325
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,230
and I always really enjoy
talking to her at parties

326
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,280
in our village.

327
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,140
Now, I probably enjoy speaking to her

328
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,279
more than she enjoys speaking with me.

329
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,900
(laughs)

330
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,210
And she says this wonderful thing once

331
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,050
when she wanted to leave our conversation,

332
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,410
but she did it in such a nice way.

333
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,440
She said, "I don't want to hog you

334
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,480
so I'm going to go over here."

335
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,050
To hog something is to
take or use something good

336
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:36,280
all for yourself so that
other people can't have it.

337
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,160
And she was saying,

338
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,530
I don't want to keep you all to myself

339
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:42,290
so I'm going to make sure other
people can talk to you too.

340
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,730
It's implying that whoever
you're talking to is so great

341
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,200
that they need to talk to lots of people,

342
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,620
so lots of people can
benefit from talking to them.

343
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,690
It wouldn't be right to
deny others the chance

344
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,980
of talking to this person.

345
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,640
I'm just gonna throw that in there.

346
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,670
I thought it was really interesting,

347
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,090
kind of like reverse psychology.

348
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,080
Instead of making me feel abandoned,

349
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,017
it made me feel flattered.

350
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:08,370
(laughs)

351
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,700
Oh, I'm so weak.

352
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,850
And the last one number 25.

353
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,250
I've already taken so much of your time.

354
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,920
I've already taken so much at that time,

355
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,800
I don't want to take any more.

356
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,100
That's a great way of saying,

357
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,270
you know I don't want to leave,

358
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,070
but I've already wasted
so much of your time

359
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,060
that I'm going to go just
because it's fair on you.

360
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,480
Right, that's it for today's lesson.

361
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Those are your 25 smart
sentences for daily conversation.

362
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:36,540
Really good if you're
going to a new place,

363
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,420
you're going to meet lots of new people

364
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,050
or you're going to see lots of people

365
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,010
that you haven't seen in a while.

366
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,990
Don't forget to check out italki

367
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,550
and remember that you can get
$10 worth of italki credits

368
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,910
for free in your student wallet

369
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,970
48 hours after making your
first purchase of any amount.

370
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:55,210
And don't forget to connect with me

371
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,480
on all of my social media.

372
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,880
I've got my Facebook, my
Instagram, my Twitter,

373
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,520
and you can now receive emails from me.

374
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,810
My email list link is down below.

375
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,360
That's very exciting.

376
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,440
And you can check out
my new personal channel

377
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,840
which isn't that new anymore,

378
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,240
I'm just really used to saying it.

379
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,030
And that's where I upload
vlogs of my life on a farm.

380
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,701
I will see you soon for another lesson.

381
00:15:18,701 --> 00:15:21,284
(upbeat music)
