00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,320
Hi, I'm Vanessa from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.  

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,760
Are you ready to learn a 
secret? Let's talk about it. 

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,400
Today, you are going to learn the number one 
secret guaranteed to help you speak English  

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,200
fluently in only 30 days. That's right, in only 
30 days you will know everything you need to know  

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,640
to be able to speak fluently, and dazzle 
other people with your amazing English skills.  

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,280
Are you ready to learn the number 
one secret? Stay tuned to find out. 

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,240
Okay, here it is. Are you ready? The secret is...  

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,880
What did you think I was going to say? Is there 
a secret to learning English fluently in 30 days?  

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,040
No, there is no secret that can 
guarantee that you will learn English  

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,840
in only 30 days. A lot of programs make this bold 
claim so that you will purchase their product,  

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,720
watch their video. And, frankly, it's quite 
dishonest. In English, we have a phrase,  

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,560
maybe this exists in your native language too, "If 
something is too good to be true, it probably is."  

13
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,200
That means if something seems perfect, there's 
probably a problem with it. It's probably lying  

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,440
to you. Sometimes this can be really frustrating, 
especially if you spend a lot of time and money  

15
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,680
hoping that that bold claim will be true.
But hold on, I'm not here to figuratively rain  

16
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,720
on your English learning parade. It may be true 
that perfect fluency is not achievable in 30 days,  

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,160
but that doesn't mean that you can't become 
fluent. It just means that your English journey  

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,600
is going to take a little longer or look a little 
different than you expect. And that's great.  

19
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,920
There's no perfect way, no set time frame, or 
exact learning style that's going to work for  

20
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,080
everyone. I'm here today to help you break 
out of that mindset and also to help you  

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,680
along on your English journey to fluency.
But do you know what? Let's use a different  

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,040
word than fluency. Fluency feels 
like there is a definite end point.  

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,720
Like when you take an exam, the exam is finished, 
and you receive a grade, and that's it. You're  

24
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,280
finished. But learning a language isn't 
like that. Instead of achieving fluency,  

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,040
I want to use the word confidence. To achieve 
confidence speaking in English, because this  

26
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,720
is something real, something that you can feel. 
You can feel your confidence growing the more  

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,360
that you learn and the more that you practice. 
So, you'll know that you're actually improving  

28
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,240
when you feel your confidence improving too.
Do you remember when you were a kid and you  

29
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,600
tried to ride a bike for the first time? Or 
roller blade or roller skate for the first time?  

30
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,680
You were probably a little bit wobbly and 
uncertain. You probably fell a lot. Probably  

31
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,000
got hurt. Hopefully, not too badly. Well, this 
takes time, and a lot of practice and effort,  

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,360
also making a lot of mistakes. Falling 
down and learning how to balance yourself. 

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,200
Well, learning English is quite similar to 
that, except you don't need to wear a helmet,  

34
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,280
I don't think so. If you are a beginner, 
now, it will take you longer to be able to  

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,480
speak English confidently. If you are an 
intermediate or advanced English learner,  

36
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,720
well, with daily practice speaking weekly with a 
teacher, or some other English learners it will  

37
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,880
take less time for you to be able to feel like you 
can speak English confidently. A big determining  

38
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,000
factor is how much time and effort you put in 
to exercising those English speaking muscles. 

39
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,280
Do you know this fable or tale of The Hare and The 
Tortoise? Or sometimes we say The Tortoise and The  

40
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:05,040
Hare. The tortoise is a turtle. A hare is a wild 
rabbit. In this story, they're going on a race,  

41
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,080
and the rabbit or the hare is so certain 
that he's going to win. Rabbits are fast,  

42
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,600
turtles are slow, it's just a fact. So, the hare 
starts running and running, and then he thinks,  

43
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:21,680
"I can take a nap. It's fine. I'll stop. Maybe 
I'll go eat some lunch. I'll take another nap,"  

44
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,080
and he gets distracted. But what does that 
tortoise do? The tortoise just goes slow  

45
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,240
and steady, never stopping, but is determined 
to make it to the end, slow and steady. 

46
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,120
Can you guess who wins the race? Well, of course, 
the tortoise wins the race. And I think that this  

47
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,400
is a wonderful example of what it means to learn 
English. If you are steady, you are consistent and  

48
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:54,160
dedicated. "Every day, I'm going to do something 
with English. Maybe it's just listen to a song in  

49
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,600
English because I don't have much time today. 
Or maybe it's watch one of Vanessa's lessons.  

50
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,320
Or maybe it's watch a full movie in English." 
Doing something dedicated consistently in English  

51
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,920
will help you achieve confidence much quicker.
The problem with the promise fluency in 30 days  

52
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,920
is that you feel so much pressure. All right, 
I need to achieve fluency in 30 days or else I  

53
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,920
lose. And it kind of feels like after 30 days, 
you won't need to do anything else ever again.  

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,160
Well, this can feel like a lot of pressure because 
first of all, like we talked about, it is not  

55
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,080
possible to become fluent or speak confidently 
in 30 days. But also, that feeling of, "I lost.  

56
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,560
I failed at learning English because 
I couldn't learn it in 30 days,"  

57
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,880
that is a terrible feeling and will absolutely 
not help you to achieve your goals in English.  

58
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,360
This is your journey. I want to help you 
to continue to slow and steady feel and  

59
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,640
more confident in English without feeling 
like mistakes are a problem. Mistakes are  

60
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,880
important. They are inevitable. You cannot avoid 
mistakes. That is an essential part of learning. 

61
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,200
So, while 30 days may be too short of a 
time for you to become a confident speaker,  

62
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,000
30 days is a great amount of time for building 
daily habits. If you do something for 30 days,  

63
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,040
great, it will become a normal part of your life. 
So, I would love to give you some suggestions. 

64
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:34,400
Suggestion number one, schedule a certain time 
each day for English. Make sure that this is  

65
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,680
realistic. You cannot say, "I will study for four 
hours after I come home from work every day." Do  

66
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,560
you know what's going to happen after one week, 
maybe less? We call this burnout. You will burn  

67
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,640
out. That means you will become so exhausted, and 
you will be annoyed at learning English. You won't  

68
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:01,680
want to do it anymore. So, make sure that you set 
a realistic time, 15 minutes, 30 minutes. Set this  

69
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,840
time aside and make it the most important 
thing that you want to accomplish that day. 

70
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,840
For that 15 or 30 minutes, you can play a podcast 
in English while you are commuting to work.  

71
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,160
If you don't commute, you could listen to 
a podcast while you're cooking breakfast,  

72
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,440
while you're folding the laundry, while you're 
taking a walk around your neighborhood. You can  

73
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,520
just spend that time doing something with English. 
Or you could subscribe to my YouTube channel,  

74
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,760
I have over 300 English lessons. Maybe 
you have not seen all of them. So,  

75
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,800
you could watch one lesson per day, that's 
about 30 minutes each day, immerse yourself  

76
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,040
in English and learn something new. Great. 
And I hope you will enjoy it at the same time. 

77
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:50,320
My first tip was to set aside a specific amount 
of time every day. My second tip is to surround  

78
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,080
yourself with English. Even if you're not in an 
English speaking country, you can still do this.  

79
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,240
You can find fun and creative ways to immerse 
yourself. Here are some of my suggestions.  

80
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,320
You can change the language settings on your 
phone, or on your browser on the computer.  

81
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,440
That means that just as you are looking at 
news articles, or as you are reading a recipe,  

82
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,720
whatever you're doing on your phone, all of 
the text is going to be in English. Simple,  

83
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,000
effective, and doesn't take any extra time.
You could also take some sticky notes,  

84
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,200
or little pieces of paper with tape and put 
them around your house to label different items.  

85
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,920
Write a full sentence, and this will help you 
to be able to see English and have your brain  

86
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,599
switch over to English for that moment. You could 
read your favorite books in English. If you need  

87
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:47,280
any recommendations for good books in English, 
I love reading, so I have made, I think, four  

88
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,760
videos about book recommendations. You can check 
out this one up here, which is beginner books. 

89
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,400
Or if you have never read a book in English before 
I recommend starting with those books. You can  

90
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,600
check out that link up here to get some ideas. 
Or you can check out the link in the description,  

91
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,560
which is my Amazon storefront. I have listed on 
there, all of the books that I recommend, and you  

92
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:18,400
can just click on them and purchase them. I think 
I get like 10 cents from each purchase. So, it's  

93
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,440
not really that much for me, but it's just a way 
to show you the books that you can read and give  

94
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,240
some recommendations and where you can get them.
And finally, of course, you can watch some TV  

95
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,120
shows or cartoons in English. Sometimes children's 
cartoons are a great way to get started. They use  

96
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,920
simple language for kids and they speak slowly, 
you can see the action developing. It's a good way  

97
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,560
to start to immerse yourself more in English. For 
some other ways that you can speak English just by  

98
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
being at home you can check out this video I made 
up here, which goes into that topic more in depth. 

99
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,200
My first tip was to schedule a certain amount 
of time every day. Second tip was to surround  

100
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,920
yourself with English. And the third tip is, can 
you guess? Do you got it? It is to speak. I didn't  

101
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,680
think that you could improve your speaking without 
really speaking, right? If you spend all your time  

102
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,720
listening to podcasts, watching TV shows, watching 
my videos, but never actually speaking in English,  

103
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,680
well, you're going to have a lot of head 
knowledge, but you won't be able to use it.  

104
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
So, I want to empower you to be 
able to use what you're learning. 

105
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,720
If you are like most people, the thought of 
speaking in English gives you some stage fright.  

106
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,760
Stage fright means anxiety, you are nervous about 
speaking in English. Well, you're not alone. Let  

107
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,680
me give you some tips to help you get started. 
If you have a pet speak in English to them. You  

108
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,680
can narrate your day. "This is what I did today. I 
went to work and when I was talking with my boss,"  

109
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,840
blah, blah, blah, blah. Or as you're cooking, you 
can narrate what you're doing. "I need to crack  

110
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,440
the eggs. And I need to mix them together. And 
chop up some cheese." You are like the star of  

111
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,880
a cooking show and no one else is listening. 
Or if your family's listening, tell them,  

112
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,280
"Don't judge me. I'm doing my own thing." And you 
can speak out loud about these daily activities. 

113
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,640
I know it's really important to have vocabulary, 
to be able to do that, so you can check out  

114
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,320
this video that I made up here about specific 
words that you can use for daily conversation,  

115
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,800
for daily life. It's really great to be able 
to look around the room and name everything,  

116
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,200
and talk about everything that you see. These 
are real things that are in our daily lives.  

117
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,600
So, you need to be able to talk about it. 
Well, that's one way, to speak in your home. 

118
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,280
The next thing you can do to help yourself feel 
more comfortable speaking is to record your voice.  

119
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,600
The most important thing to know here is that 
you don't need to share this with anyone.  

120
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,080
You can record your voice, listen to it and 
delete it immediately. You don't need to  

121
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,840
share this with the internet. You don't need 
to share this with a teacher. If you want,  

122
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:10,000
this can be just for you. And that might help you 
to relieve a little anxiety, but it's good to be  

123
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,240
able to listen to your voice, listen to how 
it sounds, be kind to yourself. And also,  

124
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,240
hear if there are specific sounds that don't sound 
like my voice, well, if you're trying to imitate  

125
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,760
the way that I speak, it's a good thing to be 
able to improve your pronunciation based on that. 

126
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,560
I have a couple videos about shadowing 
pronunciation, that's what this is called.  

127
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,920
Listening to a native speaker, repeating it and 
recording yourself so that you can hear it. You  

128
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,040
can check out that lesson up here. I'm mentioning 
a lot of previous lessons today. You can check out  

129
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,200
this lesson up here about repeating, and saying 
some of the most important phrases, or most common  

130
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,400
phrases in English. This will help you to be 
able to speak out loud and build that confidence. 

131
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,560
My final tip for speaking is to just do it. The 
first two are a little easy. You talk with your  

132
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,800
pet, talk while you're cooking, record yourself, 
that's a little isolated. But you can find someone  

133
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,640
to speak on Zoom with, to speak on WhatsApp 
with, to speak on Facebook Messenger with,  

134
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:20,320
to speak on Skype with, to be able to contact 
someone. It could be another English learner,  

135
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,080
it could be an English teacher, but just being 
able to speak with someone else, even 10 minutes,  

136
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:32,640
simple, straightforward, have a very clear 
conversation just a couple minutes can help to  

137
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:40,800
let go of that stress, and to realize guys, "Oh, 
I can do this. I have a lot I need to improve,  

138
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,040
but I can do this. Okay, just do it."
If you don't know who to speak with a lot  

139
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,600
of students in my course, The Fearless Fluency 
Club, speak together each week, sometimes three  

140
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,680
or four times per week. They can learn the 
same lesson material that I send to them.  

141
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,000
But they can also connect on Zoom, Skype, 
WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and talk  

142
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,760
together. They can ask questions about the course 
together, practicing that vocabulary, and grammar,  

143
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,640
and pronunciation. Or they can just get to know 
each other and really deepen those friendships  

144
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,720
with people around the world in English.
So, if you would like a good place to  

145
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,840
start for meeting other people, this is 
a great place. Everyone is so kind and so  

146
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:31,040
understanding about what it's like to learn 
English and feel nervous. So, I hope that you

154
