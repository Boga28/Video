1
00:00:00,836 --> 00:00:03,969
Here we have some Old Order Amish buggies

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:06,448
and in this video guys

3
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:09,207
I'm gonna talk about what I learned here

4
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:10,856
in Amish Country Ohio.

5
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:11,976
Holmes County.

6
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:15,236
It's been an unbelievable trip and journey.

7
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,785
I've learned a ton

8
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,101
met so many interesting characters.

9
00:00:19,282 --> 00:00:21,047
So I want to share with you my biggest

10
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:22,047
takeaways.

11
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:23,509
Number one.

12
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:25,325
Amish

13
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:27,667
for those that aren't Amish

14
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,450
you know we all look at the Amish

15
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,500
as the Amish, right?

16
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,700
It's one label.

17
00:00:31,896 --> 00:00:33,154
It's not.

18
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,808
There are so many different sects

19
00:00:35,808 --> 00:00:38,475
and to make it over simplified right now

20
00:00:38,475 --> 00:00:40,009
I'm gonna talk about this hat.

21
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:42,009
this is a Swartzentruber hat.

22
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,585
Now these are the Amish
we traditionally think of.

23
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,544
The ones away from electricity.

24
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:49,997
The ones completely removed
from the modern world.

25
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,063
Well that's just a certain type of Amish.

26
00:00:53,063 --> 00:00:54,269
There's Old Order.

27
00:00:54,269 --> 00:00:55,062
There's Dan.

28
00:00:55,062 --> 00:00:56,230
There's New Order.

29
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,434
There's Beachy Amish

30
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:58,897
and these are the Amish that

31
00:00:58,897 --> 00:01:00,577
can drive cars around and

32
00:01:00,577 --> 00:01:01,777
use technology.

33
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,491
So you can't necessarily

34
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:05,530
like may of these communities in the world

35
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,631
just put

36
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,926
one label on them.

37
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:11,545
Second takeaway, community.

38
00:01:11,545 --> 00:01:12,477
They. 

39
00:01:12,477 --> 00:01:14,582
I don't think it comes as any surprise but

40
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,749
It's always different
when you feel it, okay?

41
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:20,826
They have a very, very, very
strong community.

42
00:01:20,826 --> 00:01:22,759
I just got back from an event

43
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:24,358
where they're fund raising.

44
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:27,558
They're doing an auction
for kids that can't afford

45
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:30,028
their healthcare bills and

46
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,213
none of them have health insurance.

47
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:35,285
So they collectively come
together as a community

48
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,724
and pay each other's hospital bills.

49
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:39,985
I drove by a funeral the other night.

50
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:41,485
I mean it was hundreds

51
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,477
if not thousands of people out there

52
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:44,582
from around the community.

53
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,176
Everyone sort of came in for it.

54
00:01:46,176 --> 00:01:47,176
So

55
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,080
it's really nice to feel

56
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,243
the strong

57
00:01:51,717 --> 00:01:53,043
rooted culture I would say.

58
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:55,104
Number three, language.

59
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:58,980
Most Amish speak Pennsylvania Dutch.

60
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,101
They're all bilingual.

61
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:03,001
Even the most conservative
can speak English.

62
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,597
But they speak
Pennsylvania Dutch at home.

63
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:06,421
Most of them.

64
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:07,421
So

65
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:11,406
I was told by a writer here, David Kline

66
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:12,406
that

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,991
without that language

68
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:18,063
without the cohesiveness
of their native language

69
00:02:18,324 --> 00:02:21,771
there is no way their
culture would stay together.

70
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,413
I found that quite interesting.

71
00:02:23,413 --> 00:02:24,933
So it's almost like

72
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,093
in a way, traveling to another
country when you come out here.

73
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:30,217
When you integrate with these people

74
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,951
and get into their lives and their homes.

75
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,812
You hear different language going on.

76
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:36,612
You see different customs.

77
00:02:36,725 --> 00:02:40,118
It's like traveling to a
completely different country.

78
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,798
Number four, technology.

79
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:44,228
Okay, we can see here

80
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,486
solar power battery.

81
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,449
This is my friend Brian.

82
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:49,952
He's an Old Order Amish

83
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,961
and it looks sort of like a normal home.

84
00:02:51,961 --> 00:02:53,299
They have some

85
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,854
kerosine lamps inside.

86
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:56,534
They have some solar.

87
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,832
They do have running water inside.

88
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:00,873
It's sort of like a normal place

89
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:02,718
but I'd say as a whole

90
00:03:03,263 --> 00:03:05,863
especially the more conservative you go

91
00:03:06,057 --> 00:03:08,105
there's not much technology in life

92
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,505
The most conservative, there's none

93
00:03:10,828 --> 00:03:11,828
and

94
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,657
it's almost like your stepping back

95
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:16,809
into forgotten times in a way.

96
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:19,220
And there's something
peaceful about that and calming.

97
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,740
Maybe just because I've
been in cities for so many years

98
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,432
that I feel it but it's just sort of a. 

99
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,466
Not everything is about a screen.

100
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:30,215
Even though they exist.

101
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,580
I gotta be completely fair.

102
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,436
It just depends the person you are with

103
00:03:34,436 --> 00:03:35,917
but as a whole

104
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,325
it's not

105
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:39,446
the center point if that makes any sense.

106
00:03:39,446 --> 00:03:40,784
I don't think

107
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:43,916
the screen is coming out
to dinner with the family.

108
00:03:44,304 --> 00:03:48,298
If the world ever does
completely go into the ground

109
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,280
then the most conservative Amish

110
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,739
I don't think will be too affected.

111
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:55,978
Nothing will really change in their lives

112
00:03:55,978 --> 00:03:57,711
short of a nuclear winter.

113
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:00,640
They won't even know it's happening.

114
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:02,104
This is my rental car

115
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:05,752
but every time I've drove
up to my friend Brian's place. 

116
00:04:06,866 --> 00:04:08,710
There's been nothing in the driveway

117
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,577
and it's like nobody's home

118
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:13,148
but it's because they don't have a car.

119
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:15,239
So his sect of Amish

120
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,572
Old Order

121
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:17,824
can be driven around.

122
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,966
So I can drive him around, that's okay.

123
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:21,491
But he wouldn't be able to be

124
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,739
driving around in a car on his own.

125
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:25,450
Problems.

126
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,633
I don't want to
over-romanticize any culture

127
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:31,799
and as I feel like a foreigner
coming into another culture

128
00:04:32,327 --> 00:04:34,247
when you have a short amount of time

129
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:36,303
everything looks great usually.

130
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:37,317
Especially here.

131
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:38,421
I mean

132
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,652
the gardens are kept well.

133
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:40,954
Everyone's mowing grass.

134
00:04:40,954 --> 00:04:42,221
everything looks nice.

135
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:44,288
The people are very respectful.

136
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:46,264
Very little crime.

137
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:50,671
But I've gotten in a lot of
conversations this last week and

138
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,311
what everyone sort of told me is like,

139
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,627
"We're human just like everyone else."

140
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,761
I mean there are drug
problems in the society.

141
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:00,555
There are drinking problems in the society.

142
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,960
There are every other type of problem

143
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,470
that every other society is dealing with.

144
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,512
Maybe at a lesser level.

145
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:08,552
I don't know.

146
00:05:09,217 --> 00:05:10,924
Definitely on the surface

147
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:12,767
it looks very well off

148
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:16,312
but don't get  me wrong when
I show all these places and

149
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:17,700
speak so highly that

150
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,846
I'm trying to romanticize the fact
that there are no problems here.

151
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:21,760
There are problems.

152
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,185
The puppy mill thing
is a big deal obviously

153
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,452
that's gotten a lot of attention.

154
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,982
I didn't meet anyone
that had a puppy mill.

155
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,314
It's not like I came into contact with it

156
00:05:32,314 --> 00:05:33,754
but it does exist.

157
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:37,778
Obviously there are those that
want to break free from the religion

158
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:38,867
and move out on their own

159
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:41,330
and maybe they're excommunicated.

160
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,666
I didn't come into that story

161
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:44,346
but I know it happens.

162
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,890
So no, not everything is perfect.

163
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:47,033
Friendliness.

164
00:05:47,033 --> 00:05:48,992
I thought it would be a little less open

165
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:50,982
a little less friendly.

166
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:55,958
I thought these people are really
trying to hold their world together

167
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,649
and be apart

168
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,472
from the modern world,
the outside world to some degree.

169
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:02,539
Therefore they're gonna be cold

170
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:04,423
inhospitable.

171
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,064
Couldn't be any further from the truth.

172
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:08,589
People really

173
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:09,589
helped me

174
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:10,425
smiled at me

175
00:06:10,425 --> 00:06:11,763
brought me around

176
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:13,210
gave me their time.

177
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,570
Maybe I was lucky

178
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:18,713
but overall there's a nice
friendliness in the culture

179
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:22,315
and it's interesting how they get
along with the non-Amish pretty well.

180
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,351
I heard some people don't.

181
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,185
Like they want to have nothing
to do with the non-Amish

182
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:28,195
but a lot of people do

183
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:29,874
and that surprised me.

184
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:31,748
I didn't think it would be

185
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:33,103
so easy to get into.

186
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:35,204
Now to get into with a camera

187
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,179
different story.

188
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,246
That's not easy.

189
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:38,048
That's super hard.

190
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:39,428
It's been a challenge.

191
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,315
So I'm pretty happy with
the footage I've gotten here

192
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,258
over my last week.

193
00:06:43,582 --> 00:06:45,704
And lastly, I want to say hard work.

194
00:06:45,704 --> 00:06:47,384
These people work hard.

195
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:50,676
I want to do a shout out
to the Swartzentrubers.

196
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,324
These are the most traditional Amish people

197
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:54,764
as I said earlier.

198
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:56,045
They work the hardest.

199
00:06:56,045 --> 00:06:57,697
I mean they're heating their water.

200
00:06:58,068 --> 00:06:59,318
They're canning everything.

201
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,985
They are living completely off the land

202
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,138
and those people. 

203
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:06,850
Wow, all they do is work.

204
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,619
But Amish in general work very hard.

205
00:07:10,619 --> 00:07:12,875
They're very proud of what they build.

206
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:14,580
They're very much

207
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,406
hands focused and

208
00:07:16,406 --> 00:07:18,461
building furniture
or working in the field.

209
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:19,461
So

210
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,770
they see the end results of their work

211
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,578
and they're very proud of that.

212
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,602
So lastly

213
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,194
will I become Amish?

214
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,016
No.

215
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:31,496
It's not happening.

216
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:32,967
I'm too much of an individual.

217
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:34,840
You know we all come
from different conditions

218
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,520
different circumstances.

219
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,143
I see the attraction.

220
00:07:38,143 --> 00:07:39,943
I fully see the attraction

221
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,001
here in this community

222
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:46,737
and I'm not saying my ways
are better or worse at all.

223
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:49,285
Because I admired a lot of what I saw here

224
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,771
and a lot of what I experienced.

225
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:53,794
So big respect to all of the Amish

226
00:07:53,794 --> 00:07:57,066
who showed me their world with open arms.

227
00:07:57,066 --> 00:07:59,898
I want to especially thank Josh Miller

228
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,870
and Brian Miller.

229
00:08:02,408 --> 00:08:04,088
No, they're not brothers

230
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,411
but it seems like everyone
either has the name Miller

231
00:08:07,411 --> 00:08:08,411
or Yoder.

232
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:11,318
There are a few other names
but they're very popular names.

233
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:12,866
These guys really brought me in.

234
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:14,400
Without them

235
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,920
no way I woulda had

236
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,728
the access for the series.

237
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:19,992
If you haven’t seen the series

238
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:22,392
I'll leave a playlist at the bottom.

239
00:08:22,392 --> 00:08:25,259
I got into different
aspects of the culture

240
00:08:25,783 --> 00:08:27,114
here but no.

241
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,273
Amazing people.

242
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,978
Want to thank everyone involved with this.

243
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:34,530
All right guys, if you haven't
been to Amish Country

244
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,854
and if you're thinking of going I would say

245
00:08:36,855 --> 00:08:38,208
be super respectful.

246
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:39,573
Like I don't. 

247
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:42,208
I don't like putting
cameras on people's faces

248
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,728
that don't want it.

249
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:46,918
I didn't have a telephoto lens
zooming up on people's personal life

250
00:08:46,918 --> 00:08:50,121
and there's so many times
where I had the best footage ever

251
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:51,412
and I couldn't use the camera

252
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,678
and I coulda probably snuck it in.

253
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,421
I don't want to be that guy.

254
00:08:56,421 --> 00:08:57,976
It's quite disrespectful.

255
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:59,760
So the best stuff was really off-camera.

256
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,173
So keep that in mind if you come here.

257
00:09:02,173 --> 00:09:03,366
Just be respectful.

258
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:08,595
Be cool to people and
they'll give it back in volumes.

259
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:09,715
All right guys

260
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,326
thanks for following the
journey in Holmes County Ohio.

261
00:09:14,326 --> 00:09:15,762
See you in the next one.
