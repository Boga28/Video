1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,130
Aww yeah, I'm Ethan you're a life English
fluency coach and today we're talking

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,500
about one of my favorite topics.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,719
So we are going to show you ten great songs

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,500
for you to learn English with and not
only this, we will also teach you some

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,109
great vocabulary, expressions and
pronunciation with the lyrics and

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:21,539
finally we will give you some tips so
that you can continue learning with

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,100
songs on your own.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,250
And we'll jump into
all that in just a second but first I

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,010
want to let you know that if you're new
here every week we make you fun lessons

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,460
just like this one so that you can
understand fast speaking natives

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,160
without getting lost, without missing
the jokes and without subtitles.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,180
Like Nadana who says that
thanks to our lessons he can now speak

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,870
English fluently, so if you want it too all
you have to do is hit that subscribe

14
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,220
button and the bell down below so you
don't miss any of our new lessons.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,220
Number 10:
Your Song by Elton John.

16
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,740
Now, the reason that I chose this one is
because I recently watched the movie

17
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,490
Rocketman which is all about Elton
John's rise to fame now this was a super

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:19,060
fascinating movie and I recommend it to
you I had no idea that Elton John had

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,740
such a difficult life before I watch
this.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,560
Now he is still considered one of

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,479
the top grossing artists of all time
which means that he has sold more albums

22
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,260
than almost any other artist alive.

23
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,650
Now, if you're not so much into older music

24
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,220
then you could check out the version
that Ellie Goulding did of this song.

25
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:39,940
But let's take a look at some of the
expressions that you'll learn in Your Song.

26
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
Number 9:
Paradise, by Coldplay

27
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,560
Now this is probably my favorite song by
this iconic band, let's take a look at

28
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,520
some of the great expressions that you
can learn in this song

29
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,430
Now this is a great
song to listen to if you're feeling a

30
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,900
bit down, that is a little bit sad
because it really lifts your spirit,

31
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,680
it breaks you out of your reality and get
you dreaming of what could be.

32
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,400
Now if you like alternative bands like Coldplay
then I highly recommend that you check

33
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,030
out Vera Blue from Australia who is
another alternative artist I discovered

34
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,940
this year and absolutely loved.

35
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,040
Number 8:
New Rules, by Dua Lipa

36
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,740
Dua Lipa is an up-and-coming artist who has a really
unique sound, now what this means is that

37
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,620
she is just starting to be recognised
for her talent and becoming popular.

38
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,340
Now we chose this song because it is filled
with really fantastic connected speech

39
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:53,300
to practice your native pronunciation
and understand that is better.

40
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,180
Now if you like New Rules another song that I loved by her is Don't Start Now.

41
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,440
Hey would you like to understand
natives no matter how fast we speak?

42
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,720
and wouldn't you like to be able

43
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,330
to watch your favorite movies and series
without the subtitles?

44
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,920
Well our Fluent with Friends course can
help you a ton in reaching your goal and

46
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,660
You will learn alongside the first two

47

seasons of the TV series Friends, which
various academic studies show is the

48
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,200
best series out there for learning
English.

57
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,960
Number 7: A Hard Rain Is Gonna Fall, by Bob Dylan.

58
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:24,480
Now Bob Dylan is famous for writing
ballads, that is a song that kind of

59
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,840
tells a story, it's like poetry.

60
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,840
Now this makes them really great for learning

61
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,860
expressions and figurative language as
well as how to tell a story in English.

62
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,880
You might kind of compare him to some
similar modern artists like Taylor Swift.

63
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,959
Now he wrote this song in the 60s about
all the depressing things that he was

64
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,960
seeing happening in the news.

65
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,610
However you can probably find a lot of relevance in

66
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,120
the lyrics of the song even today.

67
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,360
Now I actually discovered the song

68
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,820
because one of my favorite folk artists,
Laura Marling, did a really amazing cover of it.

69
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,080
Now if you like Bob Dylan and his
tremendous lyrics then I highly

70
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,660
recommend you check out some similarly
famous artists like Joni Mitchell,

71
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,620
John Denver and of course Laura Marling who I
mentioned before.

72
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,300
Number 6:
Were Is The Love, by The Black Eyed Peas.

73
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,540
Now we're moving to a very different
genre but not such a different topic.

74
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,680
This song is really an anthem for global
citizens.

75
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,570
Now an anthem is a song that

76
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,740
represents a group or cause for example
your country probably has a national anthem.

77
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,560
Now I like this song because it
talks about big global problems and asks

78
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,400
us if we can love our fellow brothers
and sisters of the human race.

79
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,420
It's also great to learn a little bit about
American culture as it makes many

80
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,380
different references as well as to learn
some great expressions.

81
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
Number 5:
I Don't Trust Myself, by John Mayer.

82
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,680
So now we're moving on to one of

83
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,860
my favourite artists of all time. I've
seen John Mayer many times in concert

84
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,540
and he is an incredibly talented musician,
in fact he's probably one of the best

85
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,060
guitarists alive.

86
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:48,200
Now this song that we've
chosen is one of the ones that made me

87
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,320
really fall in love with his music and
it's great for you as an English learner

88
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,860
because you can practice connected
speech and improve your native

89
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,040
pronunciation let's take a look.

90
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:26,240
So, one of the reasons I chose John Mayer is because he has done so many different genres

91
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,820
throughout his career.

92
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,830
Earlier he did a lot of pop, but
then he kinda transitioned more into music

93
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,753
that he was more passionate about like
blues, rock and folk.

94
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,360
So I'm sure almost any of you can find something

95
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,800
that you like by him.

96
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,820
And another artist that I

97
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,850
like for the same reason is Sia, earlier
in her career she actually started with

98
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,810
more blues but nowadays you'll find her
doing more motivational pop which is

99
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:51,100
really great if you're working out.

100
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,220
Number 4:
Rain On Me, by Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande.

101
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,280
Now moving on to another artist who has
experimented with a lot of different genres: Lady Gaga.

102
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,829
but most of us might think of her more

103
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:16,480
as being like the Queen of Pop.

104
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,970
Now one of the things that I really love about

105
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:23,360
Lady Gaga is that although she is very
unique she's not just a superficial pop star,

106
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,380
she is also a big proponent of the
value of kindness and she's spoken a lot

107
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,460
about this even with the Dalai Lama
let's take a look.

108
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,920
So, other than bein a humanitarian, she's also an extremely talented lyrics writer.

109
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,960
In fact a lot of you probably saw her recent film

110
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,440
A Star Is Born, which has some really powerful

111
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:11,909
music in it but we've chosen one that is
just super fun from her new album and we

112
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:15,479
actually did a recent lesson on it and
we're going to look at a few expressions

113
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:19,019
taken from that lesson and then if you
want to continue learning with Lady Gaga

114
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,760
I recommend that you check out the full
lesson after finishing this video.

115
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,020
Number 3:
Don't Stop Me Now, by Queen

116
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,080
Now did you know Lady Gaga's name
actually comes from a song from our next

117
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,349
band, Queen? Well I was absolutely
obsessed with Queen in high school and

118
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:16,830
it's so fantastic seeing that the band
had a renaissance since the film

119
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,300
Bohemian Rhapsody came out.

120
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:21,269
Now we actually did a lesson teaching English

121
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:25,049
with three of their songs which you can
check out after finishing this lesson

122
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:28,660
but right now we'll just look at an
excerpt of it to give you a taste.

123
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,600
So if you liked that then I also highly recommend

124
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,379
that you check out
the movie Bohemian Rhapsody because

125
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,739
this is really great to learn a little
bit about British culture as well as

126
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,440
learn more about the history of the band

127
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,920
Number 2: When The Party's Over, by Billie Eilish.

128
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,040
So similar to Bob Dylan, Billie Eilish's lyrics

129
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,349
usually tell some sort of a story, which
makes it really great to pick up some

130
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:14,700
different vocabulary.

131
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,979
However with When
The Party's Over we're going to

132
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,280
actually take a look at some of the
connected speech.

133
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,620
Now, this song like many of Billie Eilish's

134
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,260
is pretty slow and it's not too melodic
which makes it perfect to sing along

135
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,060
with to improve your pronunciation and
we made a full lesson with another song

136
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:25,930
of her no time to die which I highly
recommend you check out later if you're

137
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,240
a fan of Billy Eilish's.

138
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,180
Number 1: Lose Yourself, by Eminem.

139
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,920
Now personally I'm not a huge fan of rap
but it is one of the best types of

140
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:55,180
music to learn English because it very
closely mimics the rhythm of how natives speak.

141
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,730
In fact this is one of the songs
that I used to use to teach connected

142
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:03,200
speech to my students, if you practice it
over and over again your native

143
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,080
pronunciation will improve
a lot, I promise.

144
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,670
In fact let's actually take a look from
a clip of a lesson that we made using

145
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,360
the song so that you can practice
rapping along with Eminem and improve

146
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,200
your English pronunciation.

147
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,720
All right, so if you choose any of those
songs really you're going to have a lot

148
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,600
of fun and you'll learn a lot with them,

149
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,930
and English learners ask all the time

150
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,920
what are the best songs to be
learning English with?

151
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,860
Now really you should be

152
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,270
learning with whatever songs you love
you can definitely go learn with rap and

153
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:01,540
it will be very effective but if you
hate rap then you're not going to enjoy

154
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:05,290
the process, what's more important is
that you're cultivating curiosity that

155
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,230
you're not just listening to a song you
like but you're actually taking the time

156
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,700
to go look up the lyrics and really
understand what they mean and then sing along.

157
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,850
Sing along is so important because
it really builds those muscles of

158
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,450
articulation it doesn't matter if you're
a great singer just have fun doing it on

159
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,310
your own and as promised I have a few
quick tips for you so the first one is

160
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,280
to check out Genius lyrics when you're
looking up the lyrics at any song

161
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,720
because there you can find explanations
of what the lyrics mean now a lot of

162
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,780
times just by looking up the words and
lyrics you're not going to fully

163
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,890
understand because there's different
references to culture, there's different

164
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:41,800
references to something from the
person's personal life or they are being

165
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,000
creative with the language and it's not
exactly what it seems to mean so this

166
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,820
can really help you to go beyond just
the language to understand the deeper meaning.

167
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,430
The next is to use a website
called LyricsTraining now this is really

168
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:59,020
fantastic to build your vocabulary and
your comprehension with any song now

169
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,560
basically what they do is it's kind of
like a game they take out some of the

170
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,190
vocabulary and you basically have to
type it in while you're listening to the

171
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,550
song playing this is a really great
challenge and it's a lot of fun it's

172
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,480
very addictive go check it out.

173
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,350
Now the final tip is in Spotify or whatever

174
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:18,100
platform that you use to listen to music
create a playlist of the songs that

175
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,700
you're using to learn English because
then you can listen on the go when

176
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,750
you're in your car when you're in the
shower when you're cooking dinner and

177
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,240
you can actually be singing along and
practicing any time of day.

178
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,180
And finally if you want a method to learn English
with your favorite songs then I highly
