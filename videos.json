In this video, you will learn how to use infinitives when answering questions about why someone does something. For example, if someone asks, “Why are you going to the store?” you might reply, “To buy food.” Notice that we use the infinitive “to buy” to answer the question “why”. Watch the video to learn this very simple but effective formula to give a reason for something. I will also teach you about the expression “in order to”, which is also a very effective way to give a reason for something. I will show you how and when to use it, so you will always know how to answer basic questions in English.

As he walks through the room surrounded by the people of the town, a voice begins narrating the scene, telling us exactly who this gunfighter is. But unlike every classic western to use the\nnarrator trope, the characters in this film can hear the voice.\nThis omniscient narrator quickly begins divulging the deepest, darkest secrets of the people in the saloon. He exposes infidelity, homosexuality, prejudice and even a bit of bestiality. As the story unfolds it becomes evident that the voice is a bloodthirsty bastard that wants nothing more than to see the people of the town kill each other in a needless gunfight.\n\nSubscribe for more content: https://goo.gl/VzLKfO \n\n-----\n\nThe Gunfighter won the following Awards:\n\nLos Angeles Film Festival - WINNER - Audience Award, Best Short\nPalm Springs Short Film Festival - Best of Fest Selection\nLA Shorts - WINNER - Best Comedy Short\n\n-----\n\nThe Gunfighter has been shown on following festivals:\n\nCleveland International Film Festival\nSeattle International Film Festival\nTraverse City Film Festival\nWoods Hole Film Festival\nSidewalk Film Festival\nHell’s Half Mile Film Festival\nSouth Dakota Film Festival\nNapa Valley Film Festival\n\n-----\n\nDirector: Eric Kissack\nScreenplay: Kevin Tenglin\nProducer: Sarah Platt\nMusic: Paul Thomson",

"description":"\"What's the different\"? \"Today morning\"? \"I enjoyed\"? Improve your grammar by correcting the common mistakes in these English sentences. A good review for all students, especially at intermediate and advanced levels. Also check our full resource of 100 Common Grammar Mistakes in English at http://www.engvid.com/english-resource/50-common-grammar-mistakes-in-english/\nQuiz: http://www.engvid.com/8-common-grammar-mistakes-in-english/\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nHi. I'm Rebecca from engVid. In this lesson, you'll have a chance to review eight common English errors. So, let's see how you do.\n\nThe first one: \"Today morning I woke up late.\" So, what's wrong with that? There is actually something wrong with each and every one of these. I'll tell you that in advance; there's no... There are no tricks here. Okay? So, what's wrong with that sentence? \"Today morning I woke up late.\" Well, it should be: \"This morning\". Okay? We don't say: \"Today morning\". We say: \"This morning\".\n\nNumber two: \"What's the different?\" What's the different? Well, that's wrong too, because \"different\" is an adjective. What you want to use here is the noun. So, what's the noun of this word? \"Difference\". \"What's the difference?\" Okay? This is a really common error, so make sure you don't make this one.\n\nNext one: \"I met John two years before.\" Okay? What's wrong with that? Well, over here, we can't say: \"I met John two years before.\" We can say: \"I met two... I met John two years ago.\" All right? If you use the word \"before\", then you have to say before something. \"Before I graduated\". Okay? \"Before I got married\", or whatever. But you can't use \"before\" by itself. So the proper word there is \"ago\". \"I met John two years ago.\"\n\nNext one: \"This is a six-months course.\" That sounds almost okay, but it's not okay. So the mistake here is with the \"s\". When we use this expression, it becomes... The entire expression becomes an adjective for the noun \"course\". So we should say: \"This is a six-month course.\", \"This is a million dollar contract.\" And so on. Okay? That's another... Each of these is a different element of grammar, different aspect of grammar, and so on.\n\nNext, number five: \"Thank you. I really enjoyed.\" What's wrong with that? Well, the problem is here. \"Enjoyed\" is a reflexive verb, so you would need to say: \"I really enjoyed myself.\", \"I really enjoyed myself.\", \"He enjoyed himself.\", \"She enjoyed herself.\", \"We enjoyed ourselves.\", \"They enjoyed themselves.\" Okay? So there are certain reflexive verbs in English, and we need to use them correctly. That's one of them. Very common one.\n\nOkay, number six: \"Did you loose your cellphone?\" What's wrong with that? I helped you a little bit by actually showing you where the error is. So, many people make this error. This is actually a spelling mistake. You should be spelling the word this way. \"Did you lose your cellphone?\" \"Loose\" is an adjective which means not tight, and \"lose\" is the opposite of \"find\". Okay? \"Did you lose your cellphone?\" Also, the pronunciation is \"lose\" and not \"loose\".\n\nNext one: \"This is an academic course.\", \"This is an academic course.\" So, what was wrong with what I said there? Okay? So, what was wrong was my pronunciation of that. So many people mispronounce this word. It is not \"academic\". It is \"academic\". The stress is on the middle. Academic. \"This is an academic course.\", \"This is an academic program.\" Okay? So, if... In case you make that mistake. I'm not saying you do. In case you do, make sure you correct it.\n\nLast one: \"Yes, I have a free time.\" Is that...? What's wrong there? What's going on? Okay, here. We don't need to say: \"A free time\". We need to say: \"Free time\", because this is a... Time is an uncountable noun.\n\nNow, each one of these examples represents a different aspect of grammar. So, how can you possibly learn all of them? Well, I'll give you two easy ways to help you out. One is to go to our website: www.engvid.com, because there, we have currently I think more than 700 lessons on different aspects of English grammar and of English in general for exams, for writing, speaking, all kinds of things. And by watching them, you can find the lessons that you actually need. And the other thing is that we also have... I've written actually a resource which might help you, which shows 50 such common errors that people make in English, and that might help you out as well. Okay?\n\nSo, I hope you did well, and I hope you continue to do better and better in English. All the best with your English. Bye for now.",

"header":"English Vocabulary & Slang: SCORE!!!",
"description":"Watch to learn the MANY uses of the word ‘score’ in English. I’ll teach you the different meanings of this one versatile word, which can be a noun, a verb, or even an adjective. If you already know these, watch on because I’ll also show you some surprising slang uses of the same word. They involve s#x and dr$gs. Do I have your attention now? Scooooore!!! \n\nHow well did you understand the lesson? Take the quiz: https://www.engvid.com/english-vocabulary-slang-score/\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nScore! You just found this lesson, and this lesson is on \"score\". And you're probably confused: Why did I just say: \"Score\"? Because I say it all the time. I use this when I find something that's cool or good. So, for example, if I am walking down the street and I see-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-20 dollars, I go: \"Score!\" because I found something. \"Score\" is a word that has many meanings, and I'm going to teach you what they mean in slang-yes-and also what they mean in regular, everyday language. But slang is more fun, so let's start with the regular, everyday language first of \"score\".\n\nThere's a really famous guy; he had a big beard, a big hat. Why do you wear such a big hat? I don't know. And his name was Abraham Lincoln or Abe Lincoln. He was a famous guy in America. He was a president and stuff. To shorten his name, we say: \"Abe\". And we don't say the name like: \"Linc-lon\"; we say: \"Lincoln\", which I'm still trying to work out.\n\nSo, Abe Lincoln said this famous quote; he said: \"Four score and seven years ago.\" And maybe you know \"score\" means to get a point or get a goal, and you're wondering why there's four goals and then seven years. But actually, \"score\" meaning number one, means 20. So, yes, I have to do math again, but this time I can do it. So, if you say: \"Four score\", that means 20 times four, which is-dunh-dunh-dunh-dunh-80. So-haha-four times 20 is 80. So, basically, \"score\" means 20 of something. You can get a score of apples, which means 20 apples. \"Four score and seven years ago\"-a very famous quote-actually means 87 years ago. I didn't do the math, obviously. Thanks to Josh for doing that. Unh-huh.\n\nYou might know \"score\" if you watch sports. So, if you watch hockey, or baseball, or any sports, they score a goal; and this means: When you score a goal, you get a point. So, as a sentence, you can say: \"The team scored 10 points.\" So they got 10 points. Score! Sometimes when people watch hockey, they'll all of a sudden go: \"Score!\" Right now, if you're hearing a little bit of noise, it's because there's a hockey game going on and people are going to yell. Or maybe they're just crazy people.\n\nAnother way that we use the word \"score\" as a noun is a piece of music. There is a really fantastic movie, I think, called Pee-wee's Big Adventure, and the soundtrack... \"This movie's score was written by Danny Elfman.\" So, Danny Elfman is a very famous composer, and he wrote the music or the score for Pee-wee's Big Adventure. Do you know that movie? If you've never seen the movie, go; it's so funny. Don't go; Google it, look at it on your computer. If you go to the movies, there's no movies anymore of Pee-wee's Big Adventure; I'm sorry. So it's something you're going to have to do by yourself. So, the movie's score (the movie's music) was written by Danny Elfman. Now that song is in my head. Ding-ding-ding-ding.\n\nAnother thing you can do is you can score music. This means that you arrange or change the music. As an example, as a composer, I would take... I have written music for only a violin, and a viola, and a cello, which would be three people playing it; but I want to make it a quartet which has four people, so I'm going to score the music to include a flute. So: \"The quartet\"-which means four-\"was scored for the flute, violin, viola, and piano.\" This means the music was changed or rearranged to include another instrument. Do you play an instrument? Do you play the flute? Oh.\n\nAnother way we use this is in cooking or not in cooking, but most commonly in cooking, is you make a cut or a mark on something. So, you will hear maybe on cooking shows: \"She scored the roast.\" So, a lot of the times you cut the fat of the meat so it doesn't explode and it's delicious. So, you can cut or mark the surface of something. So, your roast looks like this, you've got a layer of fat, and you score it.\n\nThe next one is also a verb, and... to draw a line through writing. So, maybe you have a teacher and your teacher doesn't like what you've written, so they get out their red pen (or in this case, a blue pen) and they do this. This is called \"score\". So, they score out the words.\n\nNow we're getting into the slang; this is where the fun happens. I told you that I say this a lot, and \"score\" means you find something that's good. Okay? So if I'm walking down the street and I see dog poo, I'm not going to yell: \"Score!\" I'm going to say: \"Ew. Somebody didn't clean up their dog poo, and this is disgusting\". […]",

"description":"http://www.engvid.com/ Do you hate going to the dentist? I LOVE going to the dentist! The dentist is a doctor for your teeth. In this English vocabulary lesson, you'll learn lots of words that you will hear at the dentist's office. I'll teach you the words for different parts of your mouth, problems you can have with them, and some of the tools the dentist will use to fix them! Don't forget to brush your quiz and to take the teeth. Oops, I mean brush your teeth and take the quiz. http://www.engvid.com/speaking-english-dentist/\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nWhat's wrong? Yeah, I know. I have a toothache. It hurts. I have to go to the dentist. What's a \"dentist\"? A \"dentist\" is a tooth doctor. Do you hate going to the dentist? I love going to the dentist. I don't know why. Ever since I was a child, I have absolutely loved going to the dentist. Maybe because my dentist gave me stickers to play with or something to take home, I don't know. I've just never been afraid of the dentist. I always thought that it was really cool to see all the tools that the dentists use and put them in my mouth. I was a strange child. Not much has changed except I've gotten bigger. My name is Ronnie. Today, I'm going to teach you about going to the dentist. Oh, the torture. Oh, the pain. Oh, the fear. Oh, the fun. I'm going to teach you some basic vocabulary that you need to know if you go to the beautiful dentist.\n\nFirst of all, we have English singular and plural. So, singular is one \"tooth\". So you can say, \"My tooth hurts\", or \"I have a toothache\" -- singular, \"tooth\". So \"tooth\" means one. If you want to talk about more than one tooth, you would say \"teeth\". Now, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, please be very careful with your pronunciation of the word \"teeth\" and \"tooth\", especially \"teeth\". If you do not stick your tongue out and say \"teeth\", it sounds like you say \"tits\", \"tits\". It sounds like you say \"tits\". Don't say that. So: \"tooth\" and \"teeth\". You must stick out your tongue to get the pronunciation of this word correct. \n\nThe next word you might know already, but thing this is strange, and think, \"Gum? Chewing gum? What? What? What is -- dentist? Chewing? No, I don't know. I don't get it.\" \"Gums\" are basically the pink -- can you get in there? -- the pink part above your teeth. So if this is a picture of my black teeth, I have a pink tissue above my mouth -- or in my mouth\n-- that surrounds my teeth like this, and these are called \"gums\". It is always plural. We don't say \"gum\". We don't say \"my gum\", we say \"gums\". So in your mouth, hopefully you have teeth. Some of you might not have all of your beautiful teeth, but that's okay. Don't worry. You have your teeth, and you have gums. So \"gums\" is the pink part here.\n\nSometimes your tooth is sore. So you might say, \"Oh, my tooth is sore. I have a toothache.\" Say this with me: \"Toothache. Toothache. I have a toothache.\" That means there's something wrong with your tooth. It's causing you pain. Uh-oh! Most of the time, the reason why you have a toothache is because you have a cavity -- \"cavity\". Now, \"cavity\" is simply a hole in your tooth. So this is a beautiful, red, healthy tooth, and what happens is a cavity makes a hole in your tooth, and it begins to rot right down to the root or the vein in your tooth, and that causes you pain. So a \"cavity\" basically just means a hole in your tooth. And because this is rotting away, it causes pain in the nerve in your mouth, causing you to get a toothache: not a good feeling, not a good situation. Unfortunately, the dentist is very expensive in Canada, so I recommend that you brush your teeth at least two times a day -- to help with the bad breath as well. You may have done a lesson on bad habits, bad breath. We don't like that. One of the reasons you may have bad breath -- or someone, not you -- is because you have a cavity. \n\nSo what you're going to do is you're going to call the dentist. You are going to make an appointment. Now, you might have noticed that I have written n-n-v-v-v-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n; \"n\" means \"noun\". So this means it is a noun, and \"v\" means \"verb\". So what's going to happen is you're going to call the dentist's office, and you are going to \"make an appointment\". \"Make\" is a verb, so you're going to call and make an appointment. The dentist's receptionist is going to say, \"tomorrow at seven.\" -\"No.\" They will arrange a time for you. I know sometimes talking on the telephone is difficult, so if you can communicate with a dentist through email, or if you can actually go to a dentist office, it will be easier for you. But it doesn't matter if you call, email, or go there. You're going to make an appointment. \n\nWhat's going to happen is the doctor is going to give you a check-up -- or the dentist, sorry. The tooth doctor is going to give you a \"check-up\". This just means he or she will check your teeth -- check if they're healthy; make sure you don't have any cavities; make sure your gums are okay.",

"description":"http://www.engvid.com/ Let's go into the bedroom... and learn some new words there! I'm going to teach you lots of bedroom vocabulary: simple words like 'pillow' and strange words like 'duvet'. Don't hit the snooze button! Wake up and learn these words now. http://www.engvid.com/english-vocabulary-bedroom/\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nHello. Welcome to my bedroom. It's not my bedroom. It's a whiteboard with words on it, but I'm going to teach you about bedroom -- vocabulary that is. Stay tuned. Maybe I'll teach you some other bedroom vocabulary if you know what I mean. We're going to go on the innocent side today, and I'm going to teach you about basic things in bedrooms. I know. I know. \n\nOkay. This is a bed. Do you sleep on a bed, or do you sleep on a futon? Did I speak Japanese? Hi, Japanese people in the house. Konnichiwa. O-genki desu ka? When you sleep, you usually sleep on a \"futon\". We have stolen your word. We're so nice. And we use it for our own. \"Futon\" -- if you know or don't know -- is, basically, a mattress that you put on the floor. It sounds kind of uncomfortable, but it's really, really good if you're really drunk, and there's never a fear of falling out of the bed. You just kind of roll over and, boom, you're awake. It has some advantages and some disadvantages. So this is a picture of a bed. I am an artist. Remember this as we go through this. \n\nThe first very common thing that you will find in a bedroom is a pillow. \"Pillow\". A lot of people -- I don't know why -- have never learned this word in English. I know it's not in a lot of textbooks. You don't open your textbook and go, \"Wow, this is a pillow.\" You're more like, \"This is a pen.\" Thanks. I know that. So the first one is a pillow. A \"pillow\" is a soft or hard, squishy thing that you put your head on -- not that head; this head. And to keep your pillow clean, you're going to put a pillow case on it. A \"pillow case\" is like a cover for the pillow. You can take the pillow case off, and please wash it. You can have different kinds of pillows. There're feather pillows. So what we do is we take a duck or a goose; we kill it; we take all its feathers off; and we stick them in a pillow. Yeah. I don't think that's really cool. Or you can just have a fluffy cotton pillow or another microfibre pillow. You have a pillow case. \n\nThe next thing that is essential for a bed -- please -- are sheets. Now be careful with your pronunciation. You don't want to say \"shits\". That's the stuff that comes out of your bum. You want to say \"sheets\". When you say this, the \"e's\" are very long. So you're going to say \"sheets\". Usually, we have a top sheet and a fitted sheet. The fitted sheet just means it's the bottom sheet. They like to use fancy words like fitted sheet, top sheet -- just two sheets. And you know what? You can use just two of these. Don't worry about it. The top sheet -- it goes on top. And the fitted sheet goes on the bottom. It covers -- the main part of your bed here is a mattress. The \"mattress\" is, like, a big fluffy thing that you get to relax on. And the black part of my picture would be a bed frame. Let's write that down. It's important. So a \"bed frame\" is the support of the mattress. Pillow, pillow case, sheets, top and bottom or fitted sheets. \n\nNext: In Canada, or maybe in your country, in the winter, it's cold. You want something to cover you. Sheets are very thin. They're usually made of cotton. A \"cover\" or a \"blanket\", a \"duvet\" -- du-what? This word is a French word. So the way that we say it looks very different from the spelling. It looks like \"duvette\". I think that maybe some people -- especially people in America -- would say, \"I got a new duvette cover. It's got some 'dubyas' on it.\" It's actually very important that you say this properly and you say \"duvet\". So it's like \"du-vay\". The next one is a comforter. \"Comforter\", \"duvet\", \"blanket\", \"cover\", and the last one, a \"quilt\" -- they're all the same. Don't tell people who like to design beds and fabrics that it's just something that keeps you warm. There are slight differences between a quilt, a comforter, and a duvet, but you can discover that for yourself. You've got homework. Go to a store. Ask the people that work there to show you a quilt, a comforter, a duvet, a blanket, and a cover. You're practicing your English.\n\nThe next thing that you would have in your bedroom is furniture. \"Furniture\" is an uncountable noun. \"Furniture\" includes a bed, a nightstand -- \"Ronnie, what's a 'nightstand'?\" Oh, \"standing up\", \"nighttime\" -- what? No. A nightstand or -- maybe this makes more sense -- a bedside table. Look at my picture. This thing right here is a \"bedside table\". It's beside your bed, and it's a table. I know. Sometimes English makes sense. \"Nightstand\" or \"bedside table\" -- these are the same. Some people say \"nightstand\"; some people say \"bedside table\". Some people just say \"that thing beside the bed\". But it is definitely a bedside table or nightstand.",

"description":"Sometimes when you want to swear, you shouldn't... like in a job interview or in front of your grandmother! That's why we have words that are not considered offensive that you can substitute into your vocabulary. This isn't B.S., I promise. Watch this freakin' lesson and learn how NOT to swear!\nTake the quiz here: http://www.engvid.com/how-not-to-swear/\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nHi, feckers. How you doing? Sometimes, you want to say bad words. But sometimes -- just sometimes -- people get angry if you use bad words. I'm going to teach you how not to swear. I'm also going to teach you how to swear. Perfect.\n\nSo we have these words in English called \"curse\", \"swear\", or \"bad words\". Okay? These are words that people -- some people -- think are bad. Part of the reason why people believe that they're bad is people who are very religious -- so if you find yourself in the middle of America, which means you're not on the East Coast; you're not on the West Coast; you're kind of in the middle, smack-dab, or if you're in Calgary or Edmonton or some places in Canada where people are really Christian, a lot of them do not like it when you say \"shit\". So you have to choose a different word. I'm here to teach you this.\n\nSo \"damn\" -- now, \"damn\" has the religious background. So \"damn\" is like, \"Damn you all to hell.\" \"Damn\" is a bad word because they're basically going to hell and not going to heaven. So instead of saying \"damn\", people say \"dang\" or \"darn\". \"Darn it!\" Some people go as far as to say, \"Rats!\" My grandmother's favorite, \"Oh, dash!\" Now, my grandmother was from Scotland, so I think this is kind of a Scottish translation of \"damn\". People in movies say \"goddamn\". That's pretty bad if you're really religious.\n\nThen, for all the people out there, \"Oh, my God.\" It's been shortened now to \"OMG\". Did you know that \"OMG\" meant \"Oh, my God\"? Did you know that? So this, maybe, I think, is an acceptable way for people to get around saying \"Oh, my God.\" I wonder if really devout Christian people like to say \"OMG\". I don't know.\n\nSo instead of saying \"god\", all they do is replace it with either \"gosh\" or \"goodness\". So instead of saying, \"Oh, my God\", you can say, \"Oh, my gosh\" or, \"Oh, my goodness.\" For me, personally, I would say these words because I'm not religious. But, like I said, some people get a little bit freaked out if you use bad language. So just to be nice, this is what you're going to do.\n\nNow, at a work place or in a very formal environment, people do not like it when you say swear words. Now, swear words are typical things like \"fuck\", \"shit\", \"bullshit\", \"bitch\", \"mother fucker\", \"horseshit\", \"son of a bitch\". These words are considered bad. These are bad words. Personally, Ronnie loves bad words. Ronnie says bad words all the time. It's hard for me to not say bad words sometimes. So in an environment like my job, I cannot use bad words. If I'm going for a job interview, I don't want to drop the F-bomb: What's the \"F-bomb\"? The \"F-bomb\" is just the word \"fuck\". People don't like the word \"fuck\". They think it's bad. So they can say, \"Ronnie dropped the F-bomb in the job interview. We're not giving her a job.\" Don't say \"fuck\" in a job interview unless you're a porn star; say it all you want.",

"description":"Do we say, \"I am eat\" or \"I am eating\"? What about \"He didn't go\" or \"He didn't went\"? These questions and more will be answered when you watch this English grammar lesson on auxiliary verbs. I will teach you how to use the three auxiliary verbs in English – \"be\", \"do\", and \"have\". We will go over each one in detail and with examples. First, you will learn how to use \"be\" in the passive and progressive forms in the present, past, and future. Then, we will look at \"do\" in the present and past simple. Last, I will teach you how to use \"have\" in the future, present, and past perfect. Plus, we will discuss the positive and negative use of \"do\" as an auxiliary verb\". Whew! There's a lot of material here, so make sure you do the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/auxiliary-verbs-be-do-have/ to test your understanding.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nMy name's Ronnie and I'm going to teach you some grammar. It's kind of a... difficult grammar, but once you learn this overview of-dunh, dunh, dunh, dunh-\"Auxiliary Verbs\", English grammar is going to become easier for you, I hope. So, if you're just beginning to learn English grammar, oh, stay in there, you can do it. Yuri, this goes out to you in Salvador, Brazil. Let's keep going, man. We have three auxiliary verbs that we use in English: \"be\", \"do\", and \"have\". But the thing about the auxiliary verbs is that each auxiliary verb will tell us what kind of grammar we're going to use with it. So, let's look at the first one: \"be\".\n\nSo, \"be\" in its form in the present tense is \"am\", \"is\", \"are\"; negative: \"am not\", \"isn't\", and \"aren't\". These are present. The past tense would be present... Or, no. The past tense in the positive is \"was\" and \"were\"; negative: \"wasn't\" and \"weren't\".\n\nSo, how do we actually use this auxiliary verb? And the answer is: We use it in two forms of English grammar. The first one is progressive. So, if you have a progressive sentence, we have present progressive, past progressive, and future progressive. Every time we have a sentence in English with progressive, we know we're going to use the verb \"to be\". So, if our sentence is present progressive, we're going to use the present tense of the verb \"to be\", \"is am are\" with a verb with \"ing\". So, in English grammar, anything that's progressive or continuous is another word for the same grammar, it's always going to be an \"ing\" on the verb. The thing that changes and tells us the grammar is the verb \"to be\". Present is: \"is\", \"am\", \"are\", plus verb \"ing\", but the past, we're going to use the past tense: \"was\" and \"were\" plus verb \"ing\". So, progressive will always have a verb \"ing\". The thing that changes the tense of it is the verb \"to be\". We have future progressive or future continuous. In this one we're simply going to use the verb \"will\", so in this one we have \"will be\" plus verb \"ing\". For example: \"I will be eating pizza.\" This tells us what's going to happen in the future. \"I was eating pizza\" was the past, and \"I am eating pizza\", something's happening now, that's present progressive. So, the progressive will always have the verb \"to be\", either past, present, or future, and it will always have an \"ing\" on the verb. Okay, cool.\n\nLet's get more complicated, okay? We have another structure in English grammar called passive. Now, passive voice basically you're taking the action from the person or the focus on the person, and we're putting it towards the activity. So, in a normal English sentence we would say: \"I eat lunch\", but in a passive sentence, we're taking away the subject and we're focusing on the action. So, with the passive voice we have future passive, present passive, and past passive. It goes along the same idea, is that the verb \"to be\" is going to tell us: Is it present? Or if it's past. When we use a passive sentence, we can only ever use the past participle of the verb, or the third step of the verb. So, passive will always be the verb \"to be\" plus the past participle. If it's present, it's: \"is\", \"am\", \"are\", plus PP, past participle. If it's past, it's \"was\" and \"were\" plus past participle. It's hard to say the past participle, so I'm going to say PP. I have to go PP. So, as an example, we say: \"Lunch is eaten\", present tense. \"Lunch was eaten\". I'm going to step away and let you check that out. Let your brain absorb it. Make some sentences using this and the verb \"to be\". If we used the future passive, I could say: \"Lunch will be eaten\", so again, when we're using the future, we use \"will be\", but we're going to use the past participle. Have you made some sentences? Do it now. Come on. Make some sentences. Go. Okay.\n\nSo we've done the verb \"to be\". And hopefully it's beginning to make sense, because English grammar rarely makes sense. I'm going to make it make it make sense for you. So, the next one is the auxiliary verb \"do\". Now, this one's interesting because we only use it in the negative form in the simple present, or we use it in the negative simple past. […]",

In this lesson, I'll teach you the vocabulary we use to talk about our dreams in English. You'll learn about the different types of dreams that you can have. I'll also tell you what your dreams could mean, and give you tips to have more interesting dreams. You may forget your dreams, but you won't forget this lesson!\nTest your DREAM vocabulary with the quiz! http://www.engvid.com/how-to-talk-about-dreams-in-english/\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nEvery night you dream at least, at least 10 dreams a night. Do you remember your dreams? If you do, you're well on your way to having some fantastic times when you close your eyes. Today I'm going to teach you about one of my favourite things in the world ever - dreams and dreaming. Maybe you know the Supertramp song: \"Dreamer\". I'm not going to sing it for you, but I'm going to teach you about some things I know about dreams.\n\nThe first one is I want you to ask yourself this question: When you dream, do you dream only in black and white or do you dream in colour? It's interesting because everyone's different. When I dream, I always dream in colour. Some people only dream in black and white, so it's a cool little thing you can ask your friends, ask your family, and see, you'll find out everyone's different. Some people only dream in colour; some people only dream in black and white. I do not know the psychology behind it. I think it's interesting, but I don't know why.\n\nThe second question that I have for you is: When you dream, are you yourself? This means first-person. So, are you...? Are you doing the action? Or are you watching or seeing yourself do the action? Some people are both, and can do both; it can switch. For me, I am always myself doing the action. Some people, it's like they're watching a movie, and they are the star in the movie. And other people, like I said, can switch and do both. At one point of the dream they can be a main character, and the other point or other dream, they can watch themselves. How about you? Tell me your answers in the comments. Tell me. Do you dream in black and white, or colour? And are you yourself in the dream or do you see or watch yourself in a dream? We'll do a little survey and find out from answers all around the world. What happens when you dream?\n\nLet's go into some terminology, some vocabulary, if you will, about dreams. Commonly... We don't really have a word for them because we don't call them \"night dreams\", but we do have what are called \"daydreams\". \"Daydreams\" are what you maybe do at work when you're supposed to be working or at school when you're supposed to be learning, or just at the end of the day on the bus. Daydreams are basically like you are physically there, but your brain is imagining different things. This is one of my hobbies, daydreaming. I remember when I was young-I'm so old now-I would just sit in my room for hours and daydream about everything and anything. It was fantastic. My imagination, massive. So daydreams happen during the daytime, yeah? And \"night dreams\", we don't actually call them \"night dreams\", we just call them \"dreams\". Are you a dreamer? \"A dreamer\" is someone who dreams, daydreams all the time. They don't really get a lot done. But I'm a dreamer. You got to have dreams, right?\n\nLet's go through a couple of kinds of types of dreams. The first one is \"lucid\". So \"lucid dreams\" mean you realize in the dream that you are actually dreaming. Now, this, ladies and gentlemen, can be really cool because you might wake up during the dream, and you go: \"Hey, I'm dreaming right now.\" If you can do this, if you can realize you're having a lucid dream, you can then begin to control your dreams. This is one thing that I experimented with when I was younger is that I would realize that I was dreaming, and I would change my dream and make it more into a fantasy. A fantastic fantasy of feathers and fudgesicles.\n\nThis is a really terrible kind of dream, it's called a \"nightmare\". Nightmares are also known as \"bad dreams\". Usually when we're children, we're sleeping, we might [screams] wake up, screaming or crying. Maybe we have dreams about monsters. This would be a nightmare. Bad dreams or nightmares cause anxiety, so something bad is happening to you in the dream, you might dream of death, somebody's dead. Maybe you watched a zombie movie, and in your dream, you're being chased by zombies. It's on a subconscious level, so things that we might have done in the day or talked about or seen can come back in our dream. They can come back in a bad way, and become a nightmare. You might wake up screaming, or crying, or something bad has happened in your dream world.",

"description":"In this English lesson I'll teach you some questions that you must know when having an English conversation. You will learn English questions that you can use when having a conversation with someone who you haven't seen for a few days, or for a long time.\n\nThis past weekend I was at a small family event, and while I was there I tried to pretend I was an English student. I tried to pretend I was learning English! I paid close attention to the questions that native English speakers used to start conversations and also during their conversations.\n\nThis English video lesson is a summary of the results. I will teach you how to ask questions in English when you don't know a lot about a person, how to ask questions when you know a bit about the person, and the most common questions I heard that day.\n\nI hope you enjoy this English lesson about the types of questions you must know to have good English conversations!\n\n\n⌛ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!\n\n--\n\n✅ Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:\n😀💲 If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join\n\nBecoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:\n1) For 10 minutes or more at the end of each live stream you will be able to participate in the \"Members Only\" chat.\n2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.\n3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.\n4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, \"Wednesdays with Bob\".

"header":"Speak English like a North American: 4 Pronunciation Rules for the Letter T",
"description":"Everyone has an accent. If you want to sound more like a native English speaker, you need to work on your pronunciation. I am from Canada, and I have a particular accent, too. Today, I will teach you four rules to help you pronounce words that have the letter T in them. This is the way Canadians and many Americans pronounce this letter. There are hard T sounds and soft T sounds. There are Ts that sound like Ds, and there are Ts that sound like a stopped sound. So many Ts! Don’t worry, though, because after watching this lesson, you will be an expert. Take the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/speak-english-pronunciation-t/ .\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nHi. My name's Ronnie, and I have a bottle of water. What? So, sometimes when I go to a restaurant and I order water, people don't understand me. I'm in Canada, I'm speaking English, and I said: \"Water\", and they look at me strange. And I go: -\"Oh, you know? Water?\" -\"Oh, water. Yes, water.\" -\"No, no. It's water.\" It's a t, right? W-a-t-e-r. This, in Canada, we call a bottle of water. And I go: \"Oh, that's really crazy because it's a bottle of water.\"\n\nNow, I get called out all the time on having an accent. Everyone has an accent. You have an accent, depending on where you're from. Everyone has an accent. So, first of all, I hate people who go: -\"Oh, I don't got an accent.\" -\"Oh, mister, you have an accent. Okay?\" Everyone has an accent, and I'm going to teach you how to improve yours or damaged English-I don't know-to speak with an American/Canadian accent. Oh my god. Where's this going?\n\nSo, I'm going to teach you a trick, and the trick is about the \"t\". I am very excited about this because I've been thinking about this for, oh, maybe ten years. Why do Canadians and Americans say \"d\"? It's a \"t\". I found the reason, and I'm going to teach you. Let's have some water, shall we?\n\nWe have three... four. I'm good at counting, again. We have four rules. Okay? So, the \"t\" pronunciation. Sometimes, as I told you, we actually say the \"t\" like a \"d\". So, this is the rule. Rule number one: If it's between... If the \"t\" is between two vowel sounds. So, check this out. This \"i\" is a vowel, and \"y\"-sneaky bugger-sometimes is a vowel, but it's a vowel sound. So, we don't say: \"ability\" in Canadian and American English; we say: \"abilidy\". That's really strange, people. Canadians, Americans, maybe you were drunk or cold when you were doing this. I'm not too sure, but just nonsensical, really.\n\nWe don't say: \"computer\", as we should; we say: \"compuder\". Hey, look at that computer, eh? So Canadian to say \"eh\" at the end. So, again, between two vowels-\"u\" and \"e\" are vowels-we're going to pronounce it like: \"compuder\". This is crazy.\n\nThe next one, as I said in the beginning: \"water\". \"a\", \"e\" are vowels, and it's going to be said like: \"wader\". When I was in Jamaica, they said: \"wata\", and I was like: \"Yes! Good. Got it.\" Again, so what I've done to help you-you're welcome-is I've just underlined the vowel. So, \"a\", \"e\"; \"e\", \"e\"; \"er\", \"er\", \"er\", \"er\". And again, this one, watch out: \"i\" and \"y\". \"y\" is a vowel sound.\n\nSo, all of these guys, magically, you're going to go from speaking your language to speaking Canadian and American English with the crazy accent, because we say: \"header\". The thing that keeps you warm... Canada's cold in the winter. We don't say: \"heater\"; we say: \"header\". And this is even more confusing now, because it looks like \"header\", but it's actually this pronunciation: \"heeder\". Turn on the heater, eh? It's cold.\n\nThis word, if you say it... Not \"better\" in my books. If you say it with a Canadian/American pronunciation; crazy way; we say: \"bedder\". Then we say: \"madder\". And then, even though we went to \"university\", we say: \"universidy\". Eh? You following? I don't know why it's crazy. Just say the \"t\" or write the \"d\".\n\nThe other rule with the \"t\" sounding like a \"d\" is if it's between a vowel and an \"l\" or an \"r\". So, as I said in the beginning... I can't even say it. \"Bottle\". It's not a bottle, Ronnie. So, if it's between an \"o\" and an \"l\", it's going to be said like a \"d\", so we say: \"boddle\". This is my vowel \"a\", and this is an \"l\".\n\nWe don't say: \"battle\"; we say: \"baddle\". Into battle, soldiers. One of Ronnie's favourite words: \"dirty\". So, we don't say \"dirty\" because we have an \"r\" and a vowel sound. So, this is the example of a vowel and an \"l\"; this is the example of a vowel and an \"r\". Okay? So, a vowel and \"l\"; a vowel and \"r\". With our numbers, again, we have a vowel and an \"r\", so these ones are going to sound like a \"d\". So, we're going to say: \"dirdy\", \"fordy\", and \"thirdy\".\n\nHave you turned thirty yet? As a joke, we like to say... Or some people like to say: \"It's my dirty 30.\" We won't go into detail with that. About that. I will let your imaginations run wild on that one. And just make sure you say: \"dirdy\" because no one is going to understand you if you say \"dirty\". You're a dirty, wee cow. […]",

My name is Emma, and we have a very special video for you today. Okay? In today's video you're going to learn a little bit of grammar about the present perfect, and then you are going to play a really fun game. Not only are you going to get to play a fun game, you're also going to get to meet my sister. Yes, Emma has a sister, so you'll get to see my sister a little bit later because she is going to play the game with us as well. So, let's get started and let me teach you this grammar point, so then we can get to the fun stuff. Okay?\n\nSo, today we're going to talk about the present perfect. The present perfect is a bit of grammar. Okay? It's a type of tense that many students get very frustrated with. They don't know: \"Do I use the present perfect? Do I use the past tense?\" It can be really difficult. So, when do we use the present perfect, and what is the present perfect?\n\nWell, let me first give you an example of a present perfect sentence, because maybe you've seen something like this before. \"Have you ever been to France?\", \"Have you ever lived in a different city?\", \"Has your sister ever been on TV?\" These are three examples of the present perfect.\n\nSo, when do we use the present perfect? Well, there's different times we use the present perfect in English. In today's lesson, we're going to focus on using the present perfect to talk about a past experience. So, this is something interesting. An experience is usually an interesting experience; although it doesn't have to be. So, it's an experience that has happened in the past. So, it's not happening now, it's not happening in the future; it's already happened. It happened before, in the past. That's why a lot of students have a hard time with the present perfect because they see the word \"present\", and they get confused. \"But how can we be talking about the past?\"\n\nWell, the present perfect can be used to talk about a past experience, and we use it to talk about a past experience when we're just talking about something that happened, but we're not talking about when it happened. We're not talking about a specific time; we're not talking about a date. We're talking generally about an experience that happened in the past.\n\nSo, I wanted to focus on present perfect questions to ask people about their experiences, because a lot of conversations start this way or have this in them. So, when we ask a person a question about the past experience, we can ask them: \"Have you ever...?\" This indicates we want to know something about somebody's past. \"Have you ever been to France?\" for example. So I'm asking you: \"In the past, have you been to France?\"\n\nSo, to create the present perfect, let's talk about form now. We have: \"Have you ever\" and then we add something called a past participle to make it the present perfect. So, what's a past participle? Well, a \"past participle\" is a form of the verb. So, for example, in this case we have the verb \"be\", \"to be\". The past participle form of the verb \"to be\" is \"been\". Okay? In this case, we have: \"Have you ever\" and we have our past participle. What's a past participle again? It's a verb in a specific form. Okay? So it's a specific form of a verb. In this case, \"lived\" is the past participle of \"live\" or \"to live\". And our last example. Oh, we have \"been\" again, which I've already discussed.\n\nSo, we use past participles in the present perfect. Now, this is where it gets a little bit challenging. There are two different types of past participles; we have our regular past participles and our irregular past participles. So, what's a \"regular past participle\"? Well, this is a verb where we just add \"ed\". Okay? So, for example: \"play\" becomes \"played\", and I add \"ed\", and that makes it a past participle. Another example is just down here: \"lived\". \"Live\", we add \"ed\" and it becomes \"lived\", and that's an example of a regular past participle. Okay? So, have you ever...? […]",

"header":"English Grammar: The Prepositions ON, AT, IN, BY",
"description":"English for Beginners: Prepositions are short words that help us express location, time, and other relationships between people and things. Some examples of prepositions are: on, at, in, and by. Do you know how to use them? For example, do we say, \"I am on a taxi\" or \"in a taxi\"? Do you like to travel \"in a plane\" or \"by plane\"? After watching this simple but useful lesson, you will know exactly which preposition to use in any situation.\nTest yourself with our quiz: http://www.engvid.com/english-grammar-the-prepositions-on-at-in-by/\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nI'm having a hard time reading on the train right now. Unh. Hold on. I'll start the lesson.\n\nHi. James from engVid. Sorry, I was on the train. I want to teach you a lesson about four basic prepositions that we use in English that sometimes get confused, and I understand why, so I'll keep it basic. But because it's basic, it's going to be 80% correct. That's a good thing, that means you can go to the website and learn more from other lessons we have. But just know that sometimes there'll be exceptions, and I may not cover it here today. I'll even give you two exceptions to help you, but why waste time? Let's go to the board.\n\nHere's Mr. E. You'll notice he has a calendar, he has a clock, and: \"You are here\"? Oh, here. \"Here\" is a location. We're here right now, doing a lesson. That's the location: engVid. Let's go to the board and do the rest of the lesson, shall we?\n\nHere's: \"at\", \"on\", \"in\", and \"by\". \"At\". I love it because it's very specific, so you always know where you are, exactly. Problem: For transportation, \"at\" doesn't have anything. Hmm. So let's go to the next one. Let's go to \"on\". On. \"On\" is used for, let's say, large vehicles or large ways of travelling, such as buses... Sorry. Trains, buses, planes, and boats. I'll come back to boat in a second; it's an exception. On the train, on the bus, and on the plane, unless you're Bill Gates, Donald Trump, or me-I'm not in that list-you don't have your own train, plane, or bus, so you usually share it with a bunch of people or a few people. It's large. So we say: \"You're on the bus\", because it covers a big area, so there are many people sitting in that area. When I get to location, you'll see what I mean.\n\nBoat is a small exception. For many people in the world, they have their own boats because maybe they do fishing, or rowing, which is a type of boat that you go by yourself. In that situation, you can use \"in\". So, if the boat is small enough, say: \"in\": \"I'm in a boat right now.\" But if it's a big boat, you have to say: \"I'm on a boat.\" Another exception for the \"on\" rule is bicycle. You're always \"on\" a bicycle. I know, I said big vehicles, but remember: a bicycle is small, and it doesn't really have a motor or an engine, so we kind of give it its own thing, because you have to sit on the bicycle, and you can never really be in a bicycle. Is that good?\n\nNow, let's go to \"in\". \"In\" is funny because there are only two things for \"in\". \"In\" we use for car and taxi. The easy way to think about it is usually you own your own car; it doesn't belong to a group of people. People just don't get on your car every time you stop it, they go in and say: \"Take me somewhere.\" And a taxi, well, when you're in a taxi, it is kind of your car. You pay the driver and you keep the car. So, this is one of those few cases where, because it belongs to me, I am in my car or I am in the taxi, because the taxi belongs to me as long as I pay the money. It's one of these funny exceptions. I don't know why, because you can put more people in a car, but I guess because you can actually own this transportation, it's yours. Think of it like the small boat. The small boat, one person is in it, you can be inside of it. All right? Cool.\n\nThe last one we're going to do is \"by\". This is how you get there. So, \"by\" is different. When we talk about \"in\" and \"on\", you are... We are talking about how you are in the vehicle. Are you sitting on the bicycle? I can see you on it? You know, a boat is on water. But \"by\" just means: How did you get here? So, when someone responds to you with: \"By car\", \"by plane\", they're telling you how they got here. Not if they're in the plane, or on the plane. They are just... That's how they got there. So, how did I get here to do this video? Wouldn't you like to know. I'm kidding. I came here by car. So, yes, I was in my car and drove here, but I would tell somebody: \"I got here by car, not by bus\", and that would tell them the difference in the transportation I took. \"How did you get here?\" You like that? Good, so that's \"by\", this is how you did it; and the way you travelled is here, \"in\" and \"on\". Remember there is a small exception for small vehicles, so a small boat you can be in. Remember small. And a bicycle, you're always on the bicycle, because people see you sitting on it. We good? Excellent. Now, that is the lesson for transportation.",

"description":"Even before COVID-19, New York was already defined by a gap between the rich and poor. Yet during the pandemic, wealth has become a determinant of survival.\nThe pandemic hit New York in the spring, with almost 800 people dying from COVID-19 each day in April. The city has been uneasy since then. People's lives have been shaken by months of stay-at-home orders, changing public health measures, \"Black Lives Matter\" protests, the presidential election, and above all the economic consequences of the pandemic, including ever-widening inequality between New Yorkers.\n\nStefanie Dodt and Christiane Meier are the creators of \"New York City Rich and Poor - The Inequality Crisis.\" They spent more than eight months following the lives of three New York families who inhabit the different strata of New York society - the bottom, the top and the middle. \nThe documentary links this long period of observation with intensive data research and analysis and shows why, long before COVID-19, it was clear who the disease would hit hardest. The boundaries between rich and poor are often clearly defined by neighborhoods. Where a person lives determines their risk of becoming infected with the virus, and health has become more of a luxury than ever. The pandemic is spotlighting the scale and consequences of economic inequality in America. In New York, a city of extremes, the emphasis is white hot - and reflects in brash New York style the structural problems all of America is facing as COVID-19 further amplifies inequality. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The time of the action is before now but not specified, and we are often more interested in the result than in the action itself.\n\nTo make the positive present perfect tense, use:\n• 'have' / 'has' + the past participle\n• Make the past participle by adding 'ed' to regular verbs (for example, 'play' becomes 'played')\n• There are a few verbs that change their spelling when you add 'ed' (for example, 'study' becomes 'studied')\n• We also have some completely irregular verbs\n\nThe negative is really simple too. Just put 'not' after 'have' or 'has'.\n\nTo make a question, put 'have' or 'has' in front of the subject.\n\nWe use the Present Perfect:\n1. To talk about unfinished actions or states or habits that started in the past and continue to the present: \nI’ve lost my keys (so I can’t get into my house)\n2. To talk about life experience. \nMelany has been to France four times\n3. With an unfinished time word (today, this week, this month, this year, etc.)\nThey have drunk too much tea today\n\nSignal words tell you what tense you have to use. For the Present Perfect the following words are used quite often:\n• just\n• yet\n• never\n• already\n• ever\n• so far\n• recently\n• since\n• for\n\nThe main difference between the Present Perfect and the Past Simple is that we use the Present Perfect to talk about unfinished actions and we use the Past Simple to talk about finished actions:\nI’ve worked here for five years (and I still work here)\nI worked here for five years (I no longer worker here)\n\nTime codes:\n0:00 The most confusing English tense\n0:39 The thing you need to remember about the Present Perfect\n1:11 How to form the Present Perfect tense (positive)\n3:32 What you should never do on tests\n4:34 How to form the Present Perfect tense (negative)\n4:48 How to form the Present Perfect tense (question)\n5:51 When we need to use Present Perfect\n7:42 Quick test\n8:19 About “Master the Use of English Tenses Like a Native” intensive\n\n⭐ INSTAGRAM - linguamarina\n⭐ LEARN LANGUAGES ABROAD - https://linguatrip.com\n⭐ ENROLL IN MY YOUTUBE COURSE - https://bit.ly/2D1Z6gf\n⭐ DOWNLOAD MY ENGLISH WORKBOOK - https://marinamogilko.co/workbook\n\n📝 Get your English text corrected instantly - https://fluent.express/\n\n📷 FILMING EQUIPMENT\n- Gear for making my 'talking head' videos - https://kit.co/linguamarina/gear-for-youtube\n- Gear for vlogging - https://kit.co/linguamarina/current-vlogging-setup\n\n🎈PROMOS\n$20 TO SPEND ON UBER - http://ubr.to/2k1B89L\n\nI use affiliate links whenever possible (if you purchase items listed above using my affiliate links, I will get a bonus)\n\n#English #EnglishTenses #PresentPerfect",

"header":"10 Phrasal Verbs with CHECK: check in, check out, check for...",
"description":"When you add a preposition to a verb, you get a phrasal verb, which allows you to express much more than with just the verb itself. In this lesson, I will teach you ten phrasal verbs that use the verb “check”. Examples include “check in”, “check out”, “check for”, “check with”, and more. Some of these have several meanings, too. If you’ve ever wondered why we “check in” at a hotel but “check into” a hospital, this lesson is for you. Check this lesson off your list, and then practice all these phrasal verbs by doing the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/10-check-phrasal-verbs/ .\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nAnd I'm back with the torture of phrasal verbs. I know everyone hates phrasal verbs; I hate them, too, because there're so many of them. They're confusing, but cool; I'm going to teach them to you. My name's Ronnie, and I am going to make you check out this lesson. So, today's lesson is phrasal verbs of \"check\".\n\nSo, we have, first of all, the construction of a phrasal verb. A phrasal verb is a verb with a preposition, or two prepositions just to make it fancy. A preposition you think of as placement; up, out, in, for, off, into, blah, blah, blah. So, these are what make English very confusing, and people look at the sky, like: \"Check up. Why am I up? No. Down. No.\"\n\nSo, if you... For example, if you \"check up on someone\", this means that you want to make sure that they are okay or that they're not doing something bad. So, you will hear this a lot in movies where the teenager will say: \"Mom, are you checking up on me\"? \"Mom, are you checking up on me?\" this means someone is concerned about what you are doing. Like I said, maybe you're doing something bad or maybe you're sick, so someone will come check up on you to make sure you are okay. So, we have two meanings; one's good, one's bad.\n\nIf you \"check out\"... You maybe have heard this in a hotel; you might see: \"Check-out time\". But, as a phrasal verb, \"check out\" means you physically leave the hotel. Also, if you go shopping and you're ready to pay for something, you can check out, which means you pay at a store. In a supermarket, there's a check-out... Check-out, girl. There's a sort of check-out area; that's a noun. So: \"I'm going to check out\" we can also use.\n\nThe opposite for \"check out\" is \"check in\". So, when you enter the hotel, you're going to confirm a reservation. Also, if you're going on an airplane-I want to go on an airplane-you go to the counter and you check in, so you confirm your reservation on an airplane, or you confirm or you get a hotel room.\n\nIf you \"check for something\", you're going to search or you're going to examine something for... To make sure it's there or not there. A common problem we have with children around the world... I remember when I was in elementary school, we all had to get checked for lice. Lice are little bugs that live in people's hair. So, we had to get checked, so: \"We checked for lice.\" So, the nurse came in and looked at everyone's head, made sure you had no bugs roaming around. I didn't have lice. Yes. Cool. Have you ever had lice? It's cool; you just get some shampoo; everything's good. Don't tell anyone. It's kind of... Maybe you won't have any friends if you have lice. So, we checked for lice.\n\n\"Check off\" is, like, a checkmark. So, a checkmark is this, and you check something off a list. So, you can make... For example: \"I checked off another point on my list.\" Maybe you have a bucket list. A bucket list are... Is a list of things you would like to do, like: \"I want to skydive.\" So, you skydive, you come back, and you... You check off skydiving on your list. Have you gone skydiving before? I haven't. I'd like to.\n\nWe can also \"check into\"-which is different from \"check in\"-a hospital. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking: \"Ronnie, why do we check in on an airplane, but we check into a hospital?\" I don't know. Okay? I didn't make these stupid phrasal verbs; I'm just teaching them to you, so I don't know. Maybe get in your time machine, go back in time and change it, or ask someone in your magical time machine, because I don't know. But you check into a hotel. As an example, if you use the future: \"We will check him into the hospital.\" Not hotel. It's certainly not a hotel.\n\nIf you check your luggage through, this sometimes can be a little bit troublesome because this is how luggage gets lost most of the time. So, imagine you are flying from destination A, then you have a stopover in destination B, and your final destination is C. So, the airline company says: \"Guess what? We will check your luggage through to your final destination of C.\" Yay. So, you go on your merry way, you go to your transfer point in B, and by the time you get to your final destination at point C, you're waiting for your luggage.\n\nOh, no, you're the last person. There's no luggage. […]",

"description":"How do you know if a word in English is pronounced with the long vowel sound or the short vowel sound? For example, “cut” and “cute” are pronounced differently, but which one has the long u sound? It may seem obvious with a short, familiar word, but what if you encounter a new word that you have never seen before? There is a quick an easy trick I have found that will give you the right answer most of the time. Watch this lesson to learn one pronunciation trick that will change your life! Then take the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/long-short-vowels-pronunciation-trick/ .\n\nWATCH NEXT:\n1. TURN NOUNS & VERBS INTO ADJECTIVES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSXHFAAM_xU&t=0s&list=PLpLRk365gbPb1TnZNvDIuXP3tDeIcu8kB&index=51\n\n2. HOW TO PRONOUNCE J & Y IN ENGLISH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdk1UBDsgNQ&t=0s&list=PLpLRk365gbPb1TnZNvDIuXP3tDeIcu8kB&index=60\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nBuh-clue. Hi. I'm Ronnie. I have something that... Oh my god, this is amazing. Honestly, this lesson will change your life. It changed my life when my good friend, Leaf, told me about this. Leaf, thank you; grammar god, you are pronunciation god - Leaf. Awesome. So, I've been trying to figure this out for ages, years, maybe 100 years because I'm a vampire, and I got it. Thank you.\n\nAre you confused about the pronunciation of vowels in English? So, for example, we have a long vowel sound, and a long vowel sound means that the vowel sounds like its alphabet name. So, for example: \"a\". But in English, we also have: \"aw\" and \"a\". Different ways to pronounce the vowels. One of them is a long vowel sound, so \"a\" is pronounced like \"a\". Then we also have a short vowel sound where \"a\" is going to be pronounced like: \"ah\". And how do you know when you read a new word to say it like \"a\" or \"ah\"? I have the answer. Oh, it's amazing. I... Okay, I get really excited about things a little bit too much; but this, I'm just super excited about it. And I want to teach you this - and, geez, it's going to change the way that you read things, the way that you learn English. So, give me some money or something. Just, enjoy. Listen. It's amazing.\n\nSo, we have some guidelines. Now, I want to make perfectly clear that people like to say \"grammar rules\", and Ronnie hates rules. I'm Ronnie. I do not like rules because they're made to be broken; and in English, there's always exceptions to rules. So, you study a rule and you learn it, and then you go: \"Oh\", but no - sorry; that's an exception. And then you say: \"Why?\" Maybe you ask someone, maybe you ask your teacher: \"Teacher, why?\" and the teacher goes: \"I don't know.\" So, please think of these as only guidelines; life-changing guidelines, though. Okay? I'm telling you.\n\nSo, we have words that have two vowels. Okay? So: \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", and sometimes \"y\" are vowels. But this is our guideline: If in the word you have two vowels, the first... Oh, I'm sorry. The first vowel sound... The first vowel in the word is going to sound like its alphabet name or it's going to sound like a long vowel sound. The second vowel, it's silent; we don't even say the second vowel. Crazy. So, in English, if there's an \"e\" at the end of the word - we don't say it. In all of the other languages of the world, we say all the vowels; but English, oh no. The \"e\" is silent; we don't say that.\n\nSo, if you have two vowels in the word, for example: \"a\" and \"e\", we're going to say the first vowel like it sounds like in the alphabet, so \"a\". We're going to say: \"ba\", and we do not say: \"bak-e\"; we say \"bake\". So, the first vowel is going to sound like the alphabet: \"bake\". What about this one? We don't say: \"fah-me\", like \"ah\"; we say: \"fame\". And, again, we don't say the last vowel in the word. So, this works with two-vowel words. The \"a\" we pronounce like an \"a\", and the \"e\" or the second vowel is silent.\n\nOne more time the rule; it's life-changing. The first vowel sounds like its alphabet name, the second vowel is silent; we don't say it. Let's try this again. So, this is \"a\". The next letter. What's this vowel sound or what's this sound in the English alphabet? \"A\", \"e\". So, we say: \"these\". We don't say: \"the-se\", \"the-se\". \"Look at the-se. Look at these.\" So, again, we're going to say the \"e\" like an \"e\", and the second \"e\" is silent. This is amazing. Woo-hoo.\n\nThis word. So, you look: \"dre-am\". \"I had an amazing dre-am last night; I was flying.\" But it's actually just a dream. So, one vowel we're going to say \"e\", the second vowel is silent. So, we don't say: \"dre-am\"; we say: \"dream\". \"I had a dream.\" Did you have a dream last night or now? Are you imagining this? No. No, no, no. This is real. Get back into this. It's amazing.\n\nLet's see with this letter. What letter is this? Now, this is hard for you guys because in your languages maybe this is \"uh\" and this is \"e\", but in English, this is \"i\". So, watch this trick. Put an eye-woo-hoo-on your \"i\". […]",

"header":"Colombia protests one month in: 45 dead and dozens disappeared | DW News",
"description":"Colombia is marking one month since a wave of deadly protests began. They started as an outcry against a controversial tax reform but soon turned into a national uprising against growing poverty and inequality. Weeks of negotiations to end the unrest have failed to bear fruit. And the prospect of a peaceful solution seemed to slip even further on Friday, when President Ivan Duque announced he was deploying the military after more people died in demonstrations.\nPlumes of smoke tower above the city of Popayan - like monuments to the resistance.\nA month of protests has turned streets across the country into smoldering battle-scars from what they see as their fight for justice.\nThe protests erupted when President Ivan Duque sought to raise taxes to pay for the pandemic. The blowback forced him to kill the bill. But the outcry continued - in outrage over the government's handling of a crisis that's seen unemployment double and inequality surge.\nAttempts to broker an end to the standoff have so far proven futile.\nAccording to official figures, more than 45 people have been killed, dozens more disappeared and thousands on both sides wounded. But human rights groups say the real toll is likely much higher.\nAnd it's only likely to get worse in the days ahead.\nOn Friday, President Iván Duque said he's deploying the army to epicenter of the unrest: Cali, where at least three people were killed in the last 24 hours.\nMeeting with Colombian Vice President and Foreign Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his concern over the deepening crisis in the country - backing the peoples' right to protest peacefully.\nFor now, though, the deadly cat-and-mouse game on the streets of Colombia continues.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n\n#Colombia #Protest #IvanDuque",

That same additive was nearly banned in America in the 1970s – until lobbying from the meat industry discredited the scientists. We reveal how, to impede or halt regulations on certain additives, lobbyists have been working in the shadows for decades. At the heart of this strategy are the scientists who collaborate, who receive generous compensation for studies that promote meat consumption. In conjunction with this, those whose work finds health risks associated with meat are ‘shut down’. From Brittany to Denmark, through California and Wisconsin, director Sandrine Rigaud conducted a year-long investigation on the tactics of the meat industry.\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG\nJoin the club and become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #MeatLobby\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\nENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainers videos and animations.

"description":"People in the North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been returning to their homes after Saturday's eruption of Mount Nyiragongo. At least 15 people are reported to have died, most of them while scrambling to flee their homes. Some are saying official warnings to evacuate came too late. Provincial authorities say the death toll is likely to rise, as the situation on the ground is still too chaotic for a thorough assessment.\nAerial pictures show a trail of destruction - a community overrun by lava from Saturday's fatal volcanic eruption. Hundreds of homes were destroyed in eastern Congo. \nPeople told of how they'd been forced to leave behind their loved ones as the lava approached. Many more people are missing since the eruption. The survivors left filled with uncertainty about the fate of their loved ones and their own futures.  \nThere's been criticism of the authorities for failing to alert residents. And while the city of Goma may have been spared - there's no question the villagers to the east have paid a heavy price.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n\n#Congo #Volcano #Nyiragongo",

Nobody knows how you feel, whether you’re homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren’t like everyone else…its ok. The whole purpose of the Marshmello project and the Mellogang is to bring together people from every corner of the world and create a family…a family that we can all count on to never let us feel Alone.

"description":"Siberia. Endless vastness – arctic temperatures. Even farther East than Japan and 5 000 kilometres north of Vladivostok lies Yakutia, the coldest republic of Russia. Yakutsk is the capital of the Yakutia republic and is located about 5100 kilometres east of Moscow. In the midst of it: Oimjakon. With its 500 residents the coldest inhabited place on earth.  This village lies in a mountain valley on the upper reaches of the banks of the Indgirka River. One of the major reasons for the freezing temperatures is the great distance from the Atlantic Ocean and the humidity that the Ocean provides to a major part of the Northern Hemisphere. Masses of mountains shield Siberia against the warm air from the west and south, while in the opposite direction, the door to the Artic stands wide open.  Thus in the winter, cold masses of air expand into the Siberian landscape completely unrestricted.\n\nThe average temperature in winter: Minus 40° Celsius. The children of the Siberian Oimjakon have the world`s coldest way to school. The extreme living conditions are completely normal for the residents of Oymyakon. This is also true for the Tariks family and their son Aljosha. He is 8 years old. The children of his age group are only excused from attending school on account of the cold at temperatures below minus 54° degrees.  \n\nEven before his departure for school Aljosha feels the grim cold. Lacking running water the house also has no bathroom. So Aljosha alredy has to go outside – to the unheated outside earth closet in the garden. Sascha’s mother cooks tea. In order to do so, she must go to outside to the front of the house, which is made of wood- as all houses in Oymyakon. Due to the great temperature differences here, concrete walls would soon crack and be destroyed. In the short summers, it can get quite warm in Oymyakon. In front of the wooden house the ice blocks are stored.  The next-door farmer had cut out of the frozen river for them. There is no running water in the Pole of Cold, with temperatures dropping to -65 degrees Celsius; no pipe work has a chance. Aljoshas mother puts the ice in the pot and cooks some tea for her son. \n\nLike every day, Aljosha must get ready to go to school. Like the majority of the other students, Sascha wears for the most part his traditional dress. The clothing prescribes to the onion-peel principle in order to protect the students from the Artic temperatures. His mother Irina has heated up the living room to 20° degrees. So when Aljosha opens the front door it is 70° degrees colder – every day life in Oimjakon. As soon as the children open the dormitory’s double doors, the icy cold brutally grabs hold of them. Within less than one second their nostrils become frozen. \n\nUnlike the students in other parts of the world, the children from Oymyakon are seldom playful but instead very concentrated on their way to school. With quick steps, they travel in groups, attempting to put the 2 kilometer route behind them as quickly as possible. There are no signs of snow ball fights. The don’t spend a second of time watching the cows, which are kept up to nine months of the year in their stalls, and are now coincidentally being lead out of the barn for a drink. Even though the cows are wearing some sort of special “bras” which protect their udders from freezing. \n\nOnce in school building, Aljosha and the other students remove many of their layers of clothing, and get going with the school lessons. For the majority of them, a welcome diversion from the coldest inhabited town on the earth.",
