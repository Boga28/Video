The time of the action is before now but not specified, and we are often more interested in the result than in the action itself.\n\nTo make the positive present perfect tense, use:\n• 'have' / 'has' + the past participle\n• Make the past participle by adding 'ed' to regular verbs (for example, 'play' becomes 'played')\n• There are a few verbs that change their spelling when you add 'ed' (for example, 'study' becomes 'studied')\n• We also have some completely irregular verbs\n\nThe negative is really simple too. Just put 'not' after 'have' or 'has'.\n\nTo make a question, put 'have' or 'has' in front of the subject.\n\nWe use the Present Perfect:\n1. To talk about unfinished actions or states or habits that started in the past and continue to the present: \nI’ve lost my keys (so I can’t get into my house)\n2. To talk about life experience. \nMelany has been to France four times\n3. With an unfinished time word (today, this week, this month, this year, etc.)\nThey have drunk too much tea today\n\nSignal words tell you what tense you have to use. For the Present Perfect the following words are used quite often:\n• just\n• yet\n• never\n• already\n• ever\n• so far\n• recently\n• since\n• for\n\nThe main difference between the Present Perfect and the Past Simple is that we use the Present Perfect to talk about unfinished actions and we use the Past Simple to talk about finished actions:\nI’ve worked here for five years (and I still work here)\nI worked here for five years (I no longer worker here)\n\nTime codes:\n0:00 The most confusing English tense\n0:39 The thing you need to remember about the Present Perfect\n1:11 How to form the Present Perfect tense (positive)\n3:32 What you should never do on tests\n4:34 How to form the Present Perfect tense (negative)\n4:48 How to form the Present Perfect tense (question)\n5:51 When we need to use Present Perfect\n7:42 Quick test\n8:19 About “Master the Use of English Tenses Like a Native” intensive\n\n⭐ INSTAGRAM - linguamarina\n⭐ LEARN LANGUAGES ABROAD - https://linguatrip.com\n⭐ ENROLL IN MY YOUTUBE COURSE - https://bit.ly/2D1Z6gf\n⭐ DOWNLOAD MY ENGLISH WORKBOOK - https://marinamogilko.co/workbook\n\n📝 Get your English text corrected instantly - https://fluent.express/\n\n📷 FILMING EQUIPMENT\n- Gear for making my 'talking head' videos - https://kit.co/linguamarina/gear-for-youtube\n- Gear for vlogging - https://kit.co/linguamarina/current-vlogging-setup\n\n🎈PROMOS\n$20 TO SPEND ON UBER - http://ubr.to/2k1B89L\n\nI use affiliate links whenever possible (if you purchase items listed above using my affiliate links, I will get a bonus)\n\n#English #EnglishTenses #PresentPerfect",

"header":"10 Phrasal Verbs with CHECK: check in, check out, check for...",
"description":"When you add a preposition to a verb, you get a phrasal verb, which allows you to express much more than with just the verb itself. In this lesson, I will teach you ten phrasal verbs that use the verb “check”. Examples include “check in”, “check out”, “check for”, “check with”, and more. Some of these have several meanings, too. If you’ve ever wondered why we “check in” at a hotel but “check into” a hospital, this lesson is for you. Check this lesson off your list, and then practice all these phrasal verbs by doing the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/10-check-phrasal-verbs/ .\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nAnd I'm back with the torture of phrasal verbs. I know everyone hates phrasal verbs; I hate them, too, because there're so many of them. They're confusing, but cool; I'm going to teach them to you. My name's Ronnie, and I am going to make you check out this lesson. So, today's lesson is phrasal verbs of \"check\".\n\nSo, we have, first of all, the construction of a phrasal verb. A phrasal verb is a verb with a preposition, or two prepositions just to make it fancy. A preposition you think of as placement; up, out, in, for, off, into, blah, blah, blah. So, these are what make English very confusing, and people look at the sky, like: \"Check up. Why am I up? No. Down. No.\"\n\nSo, if you... For example, if you \"check up on someone\", this means that you want to make sure that they are okay or that they're not doing something bad. So, you will hear this a lot in movies where the teenager will say: \"Mom, are you checking up on me\"? \"Mom, are you checking up on me?\" this means someone is concerned about what you are doing. Like I said, maybe you're doing something bad or maybe you're sick, so someone will come check up on you to make sure you are okay. So, we have two meanings; one's good, one's bad.\n\nIf you \"check out\"... You maybe have heard this in a hotel; you might see: \"Check-out time\". But, as a phrasal verb, \"check out\" means you physically leave the hotel. Also, if you go shopping and you're ready to pay for something, you can check out, which means you pay at a store. In a supermarket, there's a check-out... Check-out, girl. There's a sort of check-out area; that's a noun. So: \"I'm going to check out\" we can also use.\n\nThe opposite for \"check out\" is \"check in\". So, when you enter the hotel, you're going to confirm a reservation. Also, if you're going on an airplane-I want to go on an airplane-you go to the counter and you check in, so you confirm your reservation on an airplane, or you confirm or you get a hotel room.\n\nIf you \"check for something\", you're going to search or you're going to examine something for... To make sure it's there or not there. A common problem we have with children around the world... I remember when I was in elementary school, we all had to get checked for lice. Lice are little bugs that live in people's hair. So, we had to get checked, so: \"We checked for lice.\" So, the nurse came in and looked at everyone's head, made sure you had no bugs roaming around. I didn't have lice. Yes. Cool. Have you ever had lice? It's cool; you just get some shampoo; everything's good. Don't tell anyone. It's kind of... Maybe you won't have any friends if you have lice. So, we checked for lice.\n\n\"Check off\" is, like, a checkmark. So, a checkmark is this, and you check something off a list. So, you can make... For example: \"I checked off another point on my list.\" Maybe you have a bucket list. A bucket list are... Is a list of things you would like to do, like: \"I want to skydive.\" So, you skydive, you come back, and you... You check off skydiving on your list. Have you gone skydiving before? I haven't. I'd like to.\n\nWe can also \"check into\"-which is different from \"check in\"-a hospital. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking: \"Ronnie, why do we check in on an airplane, but we check into a hospital?\" I don't know. Okay? I didn't make these stupid phrasal verbs; I'm just teaching them to you, so I don't know. Maybe get in your time machine, go back in time and change it, or ask someone in your magical time machine, because I don't know. But you check into a hotel. As an example, if you use the future: \"We will check him into the hospital.\" Not hotel. It's certainly not a hotel.\n\nIf you check your luggage through, this sometimes can be a little bit troublesome because this is how luggage gets lost most of the time. So, imagine you are flying from destination A, then you have a stopover in destination B, and your final destination is C. So, the airline company says: \"Guess what? We will check your luggage through to your final destination of C.\" Yay. So, you go on your merry way, you go to your transfer point in B, and by the time you get to your final destination at point C, you're waiting for your luggage.\n\nOh, no, you're the last person. There's no luggage. […]",

"description":"How do you know if a word in English is pronounced with the long vowel sound or the short vowel sound? For example, “cut” and “cute” are pronounced differently, but which one has the long u sound? It may seem obvious with a short, familiar word, but what if you encounter a new word that you have never seen before? There is a quick an easy trick I have found that will give you the right answer most of the time. Watch this lesson to learn one pronunciation trick that will change your life! Then take the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/long-short-vowels-pronunciation-trick/ .\n\nWATCH NEXT:\n1.

HOW TO PRONOUNCE J & Y IN ENGLISH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdk1UBDsgNQ&t=0s&list=PLpLRk365gbPb1TnZNvDIuXP3tDeIcu8kB&index=60\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nBuh-clue. Hi. I'm Ronnie. I have something that... Oh my god, this is amazing. Honestly, this lesson will change your life. It changed my life when my good friend, Leaf, told me about this. Leaf, thank you; grammar god, you are pronunciation god - Leaf. Awesome. So, I've been trying to figure this out for ages, years, maybe 100 years because I'm a vampire, and I got it. Thank you.\n\nAre you confused about the pronunciation of vowels in English? So, for example, we have a long vowel sound, and a long vowel sound means that the vowel sounds like its alphabet name. So, for example: \"a\". But in English, we also have: \"aw\" and \"a\". Different ways to pronounce the vowels. One of them is a long vowel sound, so \"a\" is pronounced like \"a\". Then we also have a short vowel sound where \"a\" is going to be pronounced like: \"ah\". And how do you know when you read a new word to say it like \"a\" or \"ah\"? I have the answer. Oh, it's amazing. I... Okay, I get really excited about things a little bit too much; but this, I'm just super excited about it. And I want to teach you this - and, geez, it's going to change the way that you read things, the way that you learn English. So, give me some money or something. Just, enjoy. Listen. It's amazing.\n\nSo, we have some guidelines. Now, I want to make perfectly clear that people like to say \"grammar rules\", and Ronnie hates rules. I'm Ronnie. I do not like rules because they're made to be broken; and in English, there's always exceptions to rules. So, you study a rule and you learn it, and then you go: \"Oh\", but no - sorry; that's an exception. And then you say: \"Why?\" Maybe you ask someone, maybe you ask your teacher: \"Teacher, why?\" and the teacher goes: \"I don't know.\" So, please think of these as only guidelines; life-changing guidelines, though. Okay? I'm telling you.\n\nSo, we have words that have two vowels. Okay? So: \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", and sometimes \"y\" are vowels. But this is our guideline: If in the word you have two vowels, the first... Oh, I'm sorry. The first vowel sound... The first vowel in the word is going to sound like its alphabet name or it's going to sound like a long vowel sound. The second vowel, it's silent; we don't even say the second vowel. Crazy. So, in English, if there's an \"e\" at the end of the word - we don't say it. In all of the other languages of the world, we say all the vowels; but English, oh no. The \"e\" is silent; we don't say that.\n\nSo, if you have two vowels in the word, for example: \"a\" and \"e\", we're going to say the first vowel like it sounds like in the alphabet, so \"a\". We're going to say: \"ba\", and we do not say: \"bak-e\"; we say \"bake\". So, the first vowel is going to sound like the alphabet: \"bake\". What about this one? We don't say: \"fah-me\", like \"ah\"; we say: \"fame\". And, again, we don't say the last vowel in the word. So, this works with two-vowel words. The \"a\" we pronounce like an \"a\", and the \"e\" or the second vowel is silent.\n\nOne more time the rule; it's life-changing. The first vowel sounds like its alphabet name, the second vowel is silent; we don't say it. Let's try this again. So, this is \"a\". The next letter. What's this vowel sound or what's this sound in the English alphabet? \"A\", \"e\". So, we say: \"these\". We don't say: \"the-se\", \"the-se\". \"Look at the-se. Look at these.\" So, again, we're going to say the \"e\" like an \"e\", and the second \"e\" is silent. This is amazing. Woo-hoo.\n\nThis word. So, you look: \"dre-am\". \"I had an amazing dre-am last night; I was flying.\" But it's actually just a dream. So, one vowel we're going to say \"e\", the second vowel is silent. So, we don't say: \"dre-am\"; we say: \"dream\". \"I had a dream.\" Did you have a dream last night or now? Are you imagining this? No. No, no, no. This is real. Get back into this. It's amazing.\n\nLet's see with this letter. What letter is this? Now, this is hard for you guys because in your languages maybe this is \"uh\" and this is \"e\", but in English, this is \"i\". So, watch this trick. Put an eye-woo-hoo-on your \"i\". […]",

"description":"Want to improve your conversational English? Use this easy word to sound like a native speaker! When we speak casually in English, we replace many verbs with the verb “get”. If you ever use English in social situations, doing this will make your spoken English sound so much more natural! The best part about making this change, is that you probably already know how to use the verb “get”. In this lesson,  I’ll teach you some of the most common verbs you can replace with “get”.

"header":"Colombia protests one month in: 45 dead and dozens disappeared | DW News",
"description":"Colombia is marking one month since a wave of deadly protests began. They started as an outcry against a controversial tax reform but soon turned into a national uprising against growing poverty and inequality. Weeks of negotiations to end the unrest have failed to bear fruit. And the prospect of a peaceful solution seemed to slip even further on Friday, when President Ivan Duque announced he was deploying the military after more people died in demonstrations.\nPlumes of smoke tower above the city of Popayan - like monuments to the resistance.\nA month of protests has turned streets across the country into smoldering battle-scars from what they see as their fight for justice.\nThe protests erupted when President Ivan Duque sought to raise taxes to pay for the pandemic. The blowback forced him to kill the bill. But the outcry continued - in outrage over the government's handling of a crisis that's seen unemployment double and inequality surge.\nAttempts to broker an end to the standoff have so far proven futile.\nAccording to official figures, more than 45 people have been killed, dozens more disappeared and thousands on both sides wounded. But human rights groups say the real toll is likely much higher.\nAnd it's only likely to get worse in the days ahead.\nOn Friday, President Iván Duque said he's deploying the army to epicenter of the unrest: Cali, where at least three people were killed in the last 24 hours.\nMeeting with Colombian Vice President and Foreign Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his concern over the deepening crisis in the country - backing the peoples' right to protest peacefully.\nFor now, though, the deadly cat-and-mouse game on the streets of Colombia continues.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n\n#Colombia #Protest #IvanDuque",

That same additive was nearly banned in America in the 1970s – until lobbying from the meat industry discredited the scientists. We reveal how, to impede or halt regulations on certain additives, lobbyists have been working in the shadows for decades. At the heart of this strategy are the scientists who collaborate, who receive generous compensation for studies that promote meat consumption. In conjunction with this, those whose work finds health risks associated with meat are ‘shut down’. From Brittany to Denmark, through California and Wisconsin, director Sandrine Rigaud conducted a year-long investigation on the tactics of the meat industry.\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG\nJoin the club and become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #MeatLobby\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\nENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainers videos and animations.

"description":"People in the North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been returning to their homes after Saturday's eruption of Mount Nyiragongo. At least 15 people are reported to have died, most of them while scrambling to flee their homes. Some are saying official warnings to evacuate came too late. Provincial authorities say the death toll is likely to rise, as the situation on the ground is still too chaotic for a thorough assessment.\nAerial pictures show a trail of destruction - a community overrun by lava from Saturday's fatal volcanic eruption. Hundreds of homes were destroyed in eastern Congo. \nPeople told of how they'd been forced to leave behind their loved ones as the lava approached. Many more people are missing since the eruption. The survivors left filled with uncertainty about the fate of their loved ones and their own futures.  \nThere's been criticism of the authorities for failing to alert residents. And while the city of Goma may have been spared - there's no question the villagers to the east have paid a heavy price.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n\n#Congo #Volcano #Nyiragongo",

"description":"Marshmello - Alone (Official Music Video)\nOfficial Marshmello gear SHOP NOW ▶ https://mellogang.com/collections/new-arrivals/\nDownload Alone here ▶ http://smarturl.it/melloAlone \n\nA lot of people ask me where Alone and its lyrics comes from. Truth is, I had just moved away from my friends and family and I started to feel very home sick and lonely like I didn’t belong in my new settings. Everything was just happening so fast and I couldn’t really grasp where I was or who I was but all i knew was that I felt Alone. With the music video, we really wanted to send a message. Nobody knows how you feel, whether you’re homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren’t like everyone else…its ok.

"description":"Siberia. Endless vastness – arctic temperatures. Even farther East than Japan and 5 000 kilometres north of Vladivostok lies Yakutia, the coldest republic of Russia. Yakutsk is the capital of the Yakutia republic and is located about 5100 kilometres east of Moscow. In the midst of it: Oimjakon. With its 500 residents the coldest inhabited place on earth.  This village lies in a mountain valley on the upper reaches of the banks of the Indgirka River. One of the major reasons for the freezing temperatures is the great distance from the Atlantic Ocean and the humidity that the Ocean provides to a major part of the Northern Hemisphere. Masses of mountains shield Siberia against the warm air from the west and south, while in the opposite direction, the door to the Artic stands wide open.  Thus in the winter, cold masses of air expand into the Siberian landscape completely unrestricted.\n\nThe average temperature in winter: Minus 40° Celsius. The children of the Siberian Oimjakon have the world`s coldest way to school. The extreme living conditions are completely normal for the residents of Oymyakon. This is also true for the Tariks family and their son Aljosha. He is 8 years old. The children of his age group are only excused from attending school on account of the cold at temperatures below minus 54° degrees.  \n\nEven before his departure for school Aljosha feels the grim cold. Lacking running water the house also has no bathroom. So Aljosha alredy has to go outside – to the unheated outside earth closet in the garden. Sascha’s mother cooks tea. In order to do so, she must go to outside to the front of the house, which is made of wood- as all houses in Oymyakon. Due to the great temperature differences here, concrete walls would soon crack and be destroyed. In the short summers, it can get quite warm in Oymyakon. In front of the wooden house the ice blocks are stored.  The next-door farmer had cut out of the frozen river for them. There is no running water in the Pole of Cold, with temperatures dropping to -65 degrees Celsius; no pipe work has a chance. Aljoshas mother puts the ice in the pot and cooks some tea for her son. \n\nLike every day, Aljosha must get ready to go to school. Like the majority of the other students, Sascha wears for the most part his traditional dress. The clothing prescribes to the onion-peel principle in order to protect the students from the Artic temperatures. His mother Irina has heated up the living room to 20° degrees. So when Aljosha opens the front door it is 70° degrees colder – every day life in Oimjakon. As soon as the children open the dormitory’s double doors, the icy cold brutally grabs hold of them. Within less than one second their nostrils become frozen. \n\nUnlike the students in other parts of the world, the children from Oymyakon are seldom playful but instead very concentrated on their way to school. With quick steps, they travel in groups, attempting to put the 2 kilometer route behind them as quickly as possible. There are no signs of snow ball fights. The don’t spend a second of time watching the cows, which are kept up to nine months of the year in their stalls, and are now coincidentally being lead out of the barn for a drink. Even though the cows are wearing some sort of special “bras” which protect their udders from freezing. \n\nOnce in school building, Aljosha and the other students remove many of their layers of clothing, and get going with the school lessons. For the majority of them, a welcome diversion from the coldest inhabited town on the earth.",
