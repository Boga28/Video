"header":"Questions You Must Learn for English Conversations",
"description":"In this English lesson I'll teach you some questions that you must know when having an English conversation. You will learn English questions that you can use when having a conversation with someone who you haven't seen for a few days, or for a long time.\n\nThis past weekend I was at a small family event, and while I was there I tried to pretend I was an English student. I tried to pretend I was learning English! I paid close attention to the questions that native English speakers used to start conversations and also during their conversations.\n\nThis English video lesson is a summary of the results. I will teach you how to ask questions in English when you don't know a lot about a person, how to ask questions when you know a bit about the person, and the most common questions I heard that day.\n\nI hope you enjoy this English lesson about the types of questions you must know to have good English conversations!\n\n\n‚åõ Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!\n\n--\n\n‚úÖ Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:\nüòÄüí≤ If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join\n\nBecoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:\n1) For 10 minutes or more at the end of each live stream you will be able to participate in the \"Members Only\" chat.\n2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.\n3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.\n4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, \"Wednesdays with Bob\".

"description":"Everyone has an accent. If you want to sound more like a native English speaker, you need to work on your pronunciation. I am from Canada, and I have a particular accent, too. Today, I will teach you four rules to help you pronounce words that have the letter T in them. This is the way Canadians and many Americans pronounce this letter. There are hard T sounds and soft T sounds. There are Ts that sound like Ds, and there are Ts that sound like a stopped sound. So many Ts! Don‚Äôt worry, though, because after watching this lesson, you will be an expert. Take the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/speak-english-pronunciation-t/ .\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nHi. My name's Ronnie, and I have a bottle of water. What? So, sometimes when I go to a restaurant and I order water, people don't understand me. I'm in Canada, I'm speaking English, and I said: \"Water\", and they look at me strange. And I go: -\"Oh, you know? Water?\" -\"Oh, water. Yes, water.\" -\"No, no. It's water.\" It's a t, right? W-a-t-e-r. This, in Canada, we call a bottle of water. And I go: \"Oh, that's really crazy because it's a bottle of water.\"\n\nNow, I get called out all the time on having an accent. Everyone has an accent. You have an accent, depending on where you're from. Everyone has an accent. So, first of all, I hate people who go: -\"Oh, I don't got an accent.\" -\"Oh, mister, you have an accent. Okay?\" Everyone has an accent, and I'm going to teach you how to improve yours or damaged English-I don't know-to speak with an American/Canadian accent. Oh my god. Where's this going?\n\nSo, I'm going to teach you a trick, and the trick is about the \"t\". I am very excited about this because I've been thinking about this for, oh, maybe ten years. Why do Canadians and Americans say \"d\"? It's a \"t\". I found the reason, and I'm going to teach you. Let's have some water, shall we?\n\nWe have three... four. I'm good at counting, again. We have four rules. Okay? So, the \"t\" pronunciation. Sometimes, as I told you, we actually say the \"t\" like a \"d\". So, this is the rule. Rule number one: If it's between... If the \"t\" is between two vowel sounds. So, check this out. This \"i\" is a vowel, and \"y\"-sneaky bugger-sometimes is a vowel, but it's a vowel sound. So, we don't say: \"ability\" in Canadian and American English; we say: \"abilidy\". That's really strange, people. Canadians, Americans, maybe you were drunk or cold when you were doing this. I'm not too sure, but just nonsensical, really.\n\nWe don't say: \"computer\", as we should; we say: \"compuder\". Hey, look at that computer, eh? So Canadian to say \"eh\" at the end. So, again, between two vowels-\"u\" and \"e\" are vowels-we're going to pronounce it like: \"compuder\". This is crazy.\n\nThe next one, as I said in the beginning: \"water\". \"a\", \"e\" are vowels, and it's going to be said like: \"wader\". When I was in Jamaica, they said: \"wata\", and I was like: \"Yes! Good. Got it.\" Again, so what I've done to help you-you're welcome-is I've just underlined the vowel. So, \"a\", \"e\"; \"e\", \"e\"; \"er\", \"er\", \"er\", \"er\". And again, this one, watch out: \"i\" and \"y\". \"y\" is a vowel sound.\n\nSo, all of these guys, magically, you're going to go from speaking your language to speaking Canadian and American English with the crazy accent, because we say: \"header\". The thing that keeps you warm... Canada's cold in the winter. We don't say: \"heater\"; we say: \"header\". And this is even more confusing now, because it looks like \"header\", but it's actually this pronunciation: \"heeder\". Turn on the heater, eh? It's cold.\n\nThis word, if you say it... Not \"better\" in my books. If you say it with a Canadian/American pronunciation; crazy way; we say: \"bedder\". Then we say: \"madder\". And then, even though we went to \"university\", we say: \"universidy\". Eh? You following? I don't know why it's crazy. Just say the \"t\" or write the \"d\".\n\nThe other rule with the \"t\" sounding like a \"d\" is if it's between a vowel and an \"l\" or an \"r\". So, as I said in the beginning... I can't even say it. \"Bottle\". It's not a bottle, Ronnie. So, if it's between an \"o\" and an \"l\", it's going to be said like a \"d\", so we say: \"boddle\". This is my vowel \"a\", and this is an \"l\".\n\nWe don't say: \"battle\"; we say: \"baddle\". Into battle, soldiers. One of Ronnie's favourite words: \"dirty\". So, we don't say \"dirty\" because we have an \"r\" and a vowel sound. So, this is the example of a vowel and an \"l\"; this is the example of a vowel and an \"r\". Okay? So, a vowel and \"l\"; a vowel and \"r\". With our numbers, again, we have a vowel and an \"r\", so these ones are going to sound like a \"d\". So, we're going to say: \"dirdy\", \"fordy\", and \"thirdy\".\n\nHave you turned thirty yet? As a joke, we like to say... Or some people like to say: \"It's my dirty 30.\" We won't go into detail with that. About that. I will let your imaginations run wild on that one. And just make sure you say: \"dirdy\" because no one is going to understand you if you say \"dirty\". You're a dirty, wee cow. [‚Ä¶]",

My name is Emma, and we have a very special video for you today. Okay? In today's video you're going to learn a little bit of grammar about the present perfect, and then you are going to play a really fun game. Not only are you going to get to play a fun game, you're also going to get to meet my sister. Yes, Emma has a sister, so you'll get to see my sister a little bit later because she is going to play the game with us as well. So, let's get started and let me teach you this grammar point, so then we can get to the fun stuff. Okay?\n\nSo, today we're going to talk about the present perfect. The present perfect is a bit of grammar. Okay? It's a type of tense that many students get very frustrated with. They don't know: \"Do I use the present perfect? Do I use the past tense?\" It can be really difficult. So, when do we use the present perfect, and what is the present perfect?\n\nWell, let me first give you an example of a present perfect sentence, because maybe you've seen something like this before. \"Have you ever been to France?\", \"Have you ever lived in a different city?\", \"Has your sister ever been on TV?\" These are three examples of the present perfect.\n\nSo, when do we use the present perfect? Well, there's different times we use the present perfect in English. In today's lesson, we're going to focus on using the present perfect to talk about a past experience. So, this is something interesting. An experience is usually an interesting experience; although it doesn't have to be. So, it's an experience that has happened in the past. So, it's not happening now, it's not happening in the future; it's already happened. It happened before, in the past. That's why a lot of students have a hard time with the present perfect because they see the word \"present\", and they get confused. \"But how can we be talking about the past?\"\n\nWell, the present perfect can be used to talk about a past experience, and we use it to talk about a past experience when we're just talking about something that happened, but we're not talking about when it happened. We're not talking about a specific time; we're not talking about a date. We're talking generally about an experience that happened in the past.\n\nSo, I wanted to focus on present perfect questions to ask people about their experiences, because a lot of conversations start this way or have this in them. So, when we ask a person a question about the past experience, we can ask them: \"Have you ever...?\" This indicates we want to know something about somebody's past. \"Have you ever been to France?\" for example. So I'm asking you: \"In the past, have you been to France?\"\n\nSo, to create the present perfect, let's talk about form now. We have: \"Have you ever\" and then we add something called a past participle to make it the present perfect. So, what's a past participle? Well, a \"past participle\" is a form of the verb. So, for example, in this case we have the verb \"be\", \"to be\". The past participle form of the verb \"to be\" is \"been\". Okay? In this case, we have: \"Have you ever\" and we have our past participle. What's a past participle again? It's a verb in a specific form. Okay? So it's a specific form of a verb. In this case, \"lived\" is the past participle of \"live\" or \"to live\". And our last example. Oh, we have \"been\" again, which I've already discussed.\n\nSo, we use past participles in the present perfect. Now, this is where it gets a little bit challenging. There are two different types of past participles; we have our regular past participles and our irregular past participles. So, what's a \"regular past participle\"? Well, this is a verb where we just add \"ed\". Okay? So, for example: \"play\" becomes \"played\", and I add \"ed\", and that makes it a past participle. Another example is just down here: \"lived\". \"Live\", we add \"ed\" and it becomes \"lived\", and that's an example of a regular past participle. Okay? So, have you ever...? [‚Ä¶]",

"header":"English Grammar: The Prepositions ON, AT, IN, BY",
"description":"English for Beginners: Prepositions are short words that help us express location, time, and other relationships between people and things. Some examples of prepositions are: on, at, in, and by. Do you know how to use them? For example, do we say, \"I am on a taxi\" or \"in a taxi\"? Do you like to travel \"in a plane\" or \"by plane\"? After watching this simple but useful lesson, you will know exactly which preposition to use in any situation.\nTest yourself with our quiz: http://www.engvid.com/english-grammar-the-prepositions-on-at-in-by/\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nI'm having a hard time reading on the train right now. Unh. Hold on. I'll start the lesson.\n\nHi. James from engVid. Sorry, I was on the train. I want to teach you a lesson about four basic prepositions that we use in English that sometimes get confused, and I understand why, so I'll keep it basic. But because it's basic, it's going to be 80% correct. That's a good thing, that means you can go to the website and learn more from other lessons we have. But just know that sometimes there'll be exceptions, and I may not cover it here today. I'll even give you two exceptions to help you, but why waste time? Let's go to the board.\n\nHere's Mr. E. You'll notice he has a calendar, he has a clock, and: \"You are here\"? Oh, here. \"Here\" is a location. We're here right now, doing a lesson. That's the location: engVid. Let's go to the board and do the rest of the lesson, shall we?\n\nHere's: \"at\", \"on\", \"in\", and \"by\". \"At\". I love it because it's very specific, so you always know where you are, exactly. Problem: For transportation, \"at\" doesn't have anything. Hmm. So let's go to the next one. Let's go to \"on\". On. \"On\" is used for, let's say, large vehicles or large ways of travelling, such as buses... Sorry. Trains, buses, planes, and boats. I'll come back to boat in a second; it's an exception. On the train, on the bus, and on the plane, unless you're Bill Gates, Donald Trump, or me-I'm not in that list-you don't have your own train, plane, or bus, so you usually share it with a bunch of people or a few people. It's large. So we say: \"You're on the bus\", because it covers a big area, so there are many people sitting in that area. When I get to location, you'll see what I mean.\n\nBoat is a small exception. For many people in the world, they have their own boats because maybe they do fishing, or rowing, which is a type of boat that you go by yourself. In that situation, you can use \"in\". So, if the boat is small enough, say: \"in\": \"I'm in a boat right now.\" But if it's a big boat, you have to say: \"I'm on a boat.\" Another exception for the \"on\" rule is bicycle. You're always \"on\" a bicycle. I know, I said big vehicles, but remember: a bicycle is small, and it doesn't really have a motor or an engine, so we kind of give it its own thing, because you have to sit on the bicycle, and you can never really be in a bicycle. Is that good?\n\nNow, let's go to \"in\". \"In\" is funny because there are only two things for \"in\". \"In\" we use for car and taxi. The easy way to think about it is usually you own your own car; it doesn't belong to a group of people. People just don't get on your car every time you stop it, they go in and say: \"Take me somewhere.\" And a taxi, well, when you're in a taxi, it is kind of your car. You pay the driver and you keep the car. So, this is one of those few cases where, because it belongs to me, I am in my car or I am in the taxi, because the taxi belongs to me as long as I pay the money. It's one of these funny exceptions. I don't know why, because you can put more people in a car, but I guess because you can actually own this transportation, it's yours. Think of it like the small boat. The small boat, one person is in it, you can be inside of it. All right? Cool.\n\nThe last one we're going to do is \"by\". This is how you get there. So, \"by\" is different. When we talk about \"in\" and \"on\", you are... We are talking about how you are in the vehicle. Are you sitting on the bicycle? I can see you on it? You know, a boat is on water. But \"by\" just means: How did you get here? So, when someone responds to you with: \"By car\", \"by plane\", they're telling you how they got here. Not if they're in the plane, or on the plane. They are just... That's how they got there. So, how did I get here to do this video? Wouldn't you like to know. I'm kidding. I came here by car. So, yes, I was in my car and drove here, but I would tell somebody: \"I got here by car, not by bus\", and that would tell them the difference in the transportation I took. \"How did you get here?\" You like that? Good, so that's \"by\", this is how you did it; and the way you travelled is here, \"in\" and \"on\". Remember there is a small exception for small vehicles, so a small boat you can be in. Remember small. And a bicycle, you're always on the bicycle, because people see you sitting on it. We good? Excellent. Now, that is the lesson for transportation.",

"description":"Even before COVID-19, New York was already defined by a gap between the rich and poor. Yet during the pandemic, wealth has become a determinant of survival.\nThe pandemic hit New York in the spring, with almost 800 people dying from COVID-19 each day in April. The city has been uneasy since then. People's lives have been shaken by months of stay-at-home orders, changing public health measures, \"Black Lives Matter\" protests, the presidential election, and above all the economic consequences of the pandemic, including ever-widening inequality between New Yorkers.\n\nStefanie Dodt and Christiane Meier are the creators of \"New York City Rich and Poor - The Inequality Crisis.\" They spent more than eight months following the lives of three New York families who inhabit the different strata of New York society - the bottom, the top and the middle. \nThe documentary links this long period of observation with intensive data research and analysis and shows why, long before COVID-19, it was clear who the disease would hit hardest. The boundaries between rich and poor are often clearly defined by neighborhoods. Where a person lives determines their risk of becoming infected with the virus, and health has become more of a luxury than ever. The pandemic is spotlighting the scale and consequences of economic inequality in America. In New York, a city of extremes, the emphasis is white hot - and reflects in brash New York style the structural problems all of America is facing as COVID-19 further amplifies inequality. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The time of the action is before now but not specified, and we are often more interested in the result than in the action itself.\n\nTo make the positive present perfect tense, use:\n‚Ä¢ 'have' / 'has' + the past participle\n‚Ä¢ Make the past participle by adding 'ed' to regular verbs (for example, 'play' becomes 'played')\n‚Ä¢ There are a few verbs that change their spelling when you add 'ed' (for example, 'study' becomes 'studied')\n‚Ä¢ We also have some completely irregular verbs\n\nThe negative is really simple too. Just put 'not' after 'have' or 'has'.\n\nTo make a question, put 'have' or 'has' in front of the subject.\n\nWe use the Present Perfect:\n1. To talk about unfinished actions or states or habits that started in the past and continue to the present: \nI‚Äôve lost my keys (so I can‚Äôt get into my house)\n2. To talk about life experience. \nMelany has been to France four times\n3. With an unfinished time word (today, this week, this month, this year, etc.)\nThey have drunk too much tea today\n\nSignal words tell you what tense you have to use. For the Present Perfect the following words are used quite often:\n‚Ä¢ just\n‚Ä¢ yet\n‚Ä¢ never\n‚Ä¢ already\n‚Ä¢ ever\n‚Ä¢ so far\n‚Ä¢ recently\n‚Ä¢ since\n‚Ä¢ for\n\nThe main difference between the Present Perfect and the Past Simple is that we use the Present Perfect to talk about unfinished actions and we use the Past Simple to talk about finished actions:\nI‚Äôve worked here for five years (and I still work here)\nI worked here for five years (I no longer worker here)\n\nTime codes:\n0:00 The most confusing English tense\n0:39 The thing you need to remember about the Present Perfect\n1:11 How to form the Present Perfect tense (positive)\n3:32 What you should never do on tests\n4:34 How to form the Present Perfect tense (negative)\n4:48 How to form the Present Perfect tense (question)\n5:51 When we need to use Present Perfect\n7:42 Quick test\n8:19 About ‚ÄúMaster the Use of English Tenses Like a Native‚Äù intensive\n\n‚≠ê INSTAGRAM - linguamarina\n‚≠ê LEARN LANGUAGES ABROAD - https://linguatrip.com\n‚≠ê ENROLL IN MY YOUTUBE COURSE - https://bit.ly/2D1Z6gf\n‚≠ê DOWNLOAD MY ENGLISH WORKBOOK - https://marinamogilko.co/workbook\n\nüìù Get your English text corrected instantly - https://fluent.express/\n\nüì∑ FILMING EQUIPMENT\n- Gear for making my 'talking head' videos - https://kit.co/linguamarina/gear-for-youtube\n- Gear for vlogging - https://kit.co/linguamarina/current-vlogging-setup\n\nüéàPROMOS\n$20 TO SPEND ON UBER - http://ubr.to/2k1B89L\n\nI use affiliate links whenever possible (if you purchase items listed above using my affiliate links, I will get a bonus)\n\n#English #EnglishTenses #PresentPerfect",

"description":"When you add a preposition to a verb, you get a phrasal verb, which allows you to express much more than with just the verb itself. In this lesson, I will teach you ten phrasal verbs that use the verb ‚Äúcheck‚Äù. Examples include ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù, ‚Äúcheck out‚Äù, ‚Äúcheck for‚Äù, ‚Äúcheck with‚Äù, and more. Some of these have several meanings, too. If you‚Äôve ever wondered why we ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù at a hotel but ‚Äúcheck into‚Äù a hospital, this lesson is for you. Check this lesson off your list, and then practice all these phrasal verbs by doing the quiz at https://www.engvid.com/10-check-phrasal-verbs/ .\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nAnd I'm back with the torture of phrasal verbs. I know everyone hates phrasal verbs; I hate them, too, because there're so many of them. They're confusing, but cool; I'm going to teach them to you. My name's Ronnie, and I am going to make you check out this lesson. So, today's lesson is phrasal verbs of \"check\".\n\nSo, we have, first of all, the construction of a phrasal verb. A phrasal verb is a verb with a preposition, or two prepositions just to make it fancy. A preposition you think of as placement; up, out, in, for, off, into, blah, blah, blah. So, these are what make English very confusing, and people look at the sky, like: \"Check up. Why am I up? No. Down. No.\"\n\nSo, if you... For example, if you \"check up on someone\", this means that you want to make sure that they are okay or that they're not doing something bad. So, you will hear this a lot in movies where the teenager will say: \"Mom, are you checking up on me\"? \"Mom, are you checking up on me?\" this means someone is concerned about what you are doing. Like I said, maybe you're doing something bad or maybe you're sick, so someone will come check up on you to make sure you are okay. So, we have two meanings; one's good, one's bad.\n\nIf you \"check out\"... You maybe have heard this in a hotel; you might see: \"Check-out time\". But, as a phrasal verb, \"check out\" means you physically leave the hotel. Also, if you go shopping and you're ready to pay for something, you can check out, which means you pay at a store. In a supermarket, there's a check-out... Check-out, girl. There's a sort of check-out area; that's a noun. So: \"I'm going to check out\" we can also use.\n\nThe opposite for \"check out\" is \"check in\". So, when you enter the hotel, you're going to confirm a reservation. Also, if you're going on an airplane-I want to go on an airplane-you go to the counter and you check in, so you confirm your reservation on an airplane, or you confirm or you get a hotel room.\n\nIf you \"check for something\", you're going to search or you're going to examine something for... To make sure it's there or not there. A common problem we have with children around the world... I remember when I was in elementary school, we all had to get checked for lice. Lice are little bugs that live in people's hair. So, we had to get checked, so: \"We checked for lice.\" So, the nurse came in and looked at everyone's head, made sure you had no bugs roaming around. I didn't have lice. Yes. Cool. Have you ever had lice? It's cool; you just get some shampoo; everything's good. Don't tell anyone. It's kind of... Maybe you won't have any friends if you have lice. So, we checked for lice.\n\n\"Check off\" is, like, a checkmark. So, a checkmark is this, and you check something off a list. So, you can make... For example: \"I checked off another point on my list.\" Maybe you have a bucket list. A bucket list are... Is a list of things you would like to do, like: \"I want to skydive.\" So, you skydive, you come back, and you... You check off skydiving on your list. Have you gone skydiving before? I haven't. I'd like to.\n\nWe can also \"check into\"-which is different from \"check in\"-a hospital. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking: \"Ronnie, why do we check in on an airplane, but we check into a hospital?\" I don't know. Okay? I didn't make these stupid phrasal verbs; I'm just teaching them to you, so I don't know. Maybe get in your time machine, go back in time and change it, or ask someone in your magical time machine, because I don't know. But you check into a hotel. As an example, if you use the future: \"We will check him into the hospital.\" Not hotel. It's certainly not a hotel.\n\nIf you check your luggage through, this sometimes can be a little bit troublesome because this is how luggage gets lost most of the time. So, imagine you are flying from destination A, then you have a stopover in destination B, and your final destination is C. So, the airline company says: \"Guess what? We will check your luggage through to your final destination of C.\" Yay. So, you go on your merry way, you go to your transfer point in B, and by the time you get to your final destination at point C, you're waiting for your luggage.\n\nOh, no, you're the last person. There's no luggage. [‚Ä¶]",

I have something that... Oh my god, this is amazing. Honestly, this lesson will change your life. It changed my life when my good friend, Leaf, told me about this. Leaf, thank you; grammar god, you are pronunciation god - Leaf. Awesome. So, I've been trying to figure this out for ages, years, maybe 100 years because I'm a vampire, and I got it. Thank you.\n\nAre you confused about the pronunciation of vowels in English? So, for example, we have a long vowel sound, and a long vowel sound means that the vowel sounds like its alphabet name. So, for example: \"a\". But in English, we also have: \"aw\" and \"a\". Different ways to pronounce the vowels. One of them is a long vowel sound, so \"a\" is pronounced like \"a\". Then we also have a short vowel sound where \"a\" is going to be pronounced like: \"ah\". And how do you know when you read a new word to say it like \"a\" or \"ah\"? I have the answer. Oh, it's amazing. I... Okay, I get really excited about things a little bit too much; but this, I'm just super excited about it. And I want to teach you this - and, geez, it's going to change the way that you read things, the way that you learn English. So, give me some money or something. Just, enjoy. Listen. It's amazing.\n\nSo, we have some guidelines. Now, I want to make perfectly clear that people like to say \"grammar rules\", and Ronnie hates rules. I'm Ronnie. I do not like rules because they're made to be broken; and in English, there's always exceptions to rules. So, you study a rule and you learn it, and then you go: \"Oh\", but no - sorry; that's an exception. And then you say: \"Why?\" Maybe you ask someone, maybe you ask your teacher: \"Teacher, why?\" and the teacher goes: \"I don't know.\" So, please think of these as only guidelines; life-changing guidelines, though. Okay? I'm telling you.\n\nSo, we have words that have two vowels. Okay? So: \"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\", and sometimes \"y\" are vowels. But this is our guideline: If in the word you have two vowels, the first... Oh, I'm sorry. The first vowel sound... The first vowel in the word is going to sound like its alphabet name or it's going to sound like a long vowel sound. The second vowel, it's silent; we don't even say the second vowel. Crazy. So, in English, if there's an \"e\" at the end of the word - we don't say it. In all of the other languages of the world, we say all the vowels; but English, oh no. The \"e\" is silent; we don't say that.\n\nSo, if you have two vowels in the word, for example: \"a\" and \"e\", we're going to say the first vowel like it sounds like in the alphabet, so \"a\". We're going to say: \"ba\", and we do not say: \"bak-e\"; we say \"bake\". So, the first vowel is going to sound like the alphabet: \"bake\". What about this one? We don't say: \"fah-me\", like \"ah\"; we say: \"fame\". And, again, we don't say the last vowel in the word. So, this works with two-vowel words. The \"a\" we pronounce like an \"a\", and the \"e\" or the second vowel is silent.\n\nOne more time the rule; it's life-changing. The first vowel sounds like its alphabet name, the second vowel is silent; we don't say it. Let's try this again. So, this is \"a\". The next letter. What's this vowel sound or what's this sound in the English alphabet? \"A\", \"e\". So, we say: \"these\". We don't say: \"the-se\", \"the-se\". \"Look at the-se. Look at these.\" So, again, we're going to say the \"e\" like an \"e\", and the second \"e\" is silent. This is amazing. Woo-hoo.\n\nThis word. So, you look: \"dre-am\". \"I had an amazing dre-am last night; I was flying.\" But it's actually just a dream. So, one vowel we're going to say \"e\", the second vowel is silent. So, we don't say: \"dre-am\"; we say: \"dream\". \"I had a dream.\" Did you have a dream last night or now? Are you imagining this? No. No, no, no. This is real. Get back into this. It's amazing.\n\nLet's see with this letter. What letter is this? Now, this is hard for you guys because in your languages maybe this is \"uh\" and this is \"e\", but in English, this is \"i\". So, watch this trick. Put an eye-woo-hoo-on your \"i\". [‚Ä¶]",

"description":"Colombia is marking one month since a wave of deadly protests began. They started as an outcry against a controversial tax reform but soon turned into a national uprising against growing poverty and inequality. Weeks of negotiations to end the unrest have failed to bear fruit. And the prospect of a peaceful solution seemed to slip even further on Friday, when President Ivan Duque announced he was deploying the military after more people died in demonstrations.\nPlumes of smoke tower above the city of Popayan - like monuments to the resistance.\nA month of protests has turned streets across the country into smoldering battle-scars from what they see as their fight for justice.\nThe protests erupted when President Ivan Duque sought to raise taxes to pay for the pandemic. The blowback forced him to kill the bill. But the outcry continued - in outrage over the government's handling of a crisis that's seen unemployment double and inequality surge.\nAttempts to broker an end to the standoff have so far proven futile.\nAccording to official figures, more than 45 people have been killed, dozens more disappeared and thousands on both sides wounded. But human rights groups say the real toll is likely much higher.\nAnd it's only likely to get worse in the days ahead.\nOn Friday, President Iv√°n Duque said he's deploying the army to epicenter of the unrest: Cali, where at least three people were killed in the last 24 hours.\nMeeting with Colombian Vice President and Foreign Minister Marta Lucia Ramirez on Friday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed his concern over the deepening crisis in the country - backing the peoples' right to protest peacefully.\nFor now, though, the deadly cat-and-mouse game on the streets of Colombia continues.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n\n#Colombia #Protest #IvanDuque",

That same additive was nearly banned in America in the 1970s ‚Äì until lobbying from the meat industry discredited the scientists. We reveal how, to impede or halt regulations on certain additives, lobbyists have been working in the shadows for decades. At the heart of this strategy are the scientists who collaborate, who receive generous compensation for studies that promote meat consumption. In conjunction with this, those whose work finds health risks associated with meat are ‚Äòshut down‚Äô. From Brittany to Denmark, through California and Wisconsin, director Sandrine Rigaud conducted a year-long investigation on the tactics of the meat industry.\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\nSubscribe ENDEVR for free: https://bit.ly/3e9YRRG\nJoin the club and become a Patron: https://www.patreon.com/freedocumentary\nFacebook: https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/endevrdocs/\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n#FreeDocumentary #ENDEVR #MeatLobby\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\nENDEVR explains the world we live in through high-class documentaries, special investigations, explainers videos and animations.

"description":"People in the North Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been returning to their homes after Saturday's eruption of Mount Nyiragongo. At least 15 people are reported to have died, most of them while scrambling to flee their homes. Some are saying official warnings to evacuate came too late. Provincial authorities say the death toll is likely to rise, as the situation on the ground is still too chaotic for a thorough assessment.\nAerial pictures show a trail of destruction - a community overrun by lava from Saturday's fatal volcanic eruption. Hundreds of homes were destroyed in eastern Congo. \nPeople told of how they'd been forced to leave behind their loved ones as the lava approached. Many more people are missing since the eruption. The survivors left filled with uncertainty about the fate of their loved ones and their own futures.  \nThere's been criticism of the authorities for failing to alert residents. And while the city of Goma may have been spared - there's no question the villagers to the east have paid a heavy price.\n\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\nFollow DW on social media:\n‚ñ∫Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n‚ñ∫Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n‚ñ∫Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\nF√ºr Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\n\n#Congo #Volcano #Nyiragongo",

"description":"Siberia. Endless vastness ‚Äì arctic temperatures. Even farther East than Japan and 5 000 kilometres north of Vladivostok lies Yakutia, the coldest republic of Russia. Yakutsk is the capital of the Yakutia republic and is located about 5100 kilometres east of Moscow. In the midst of it: Oimjakon. With its 500 residents the coldest inhabited place on earth.  This village lies in a mountain valley on the upper reaches of the banks of the Indgirka River. One of the major reasons for the freezing temperatures is the great distance from the Atlantic Ocean and the humidity that the Ocean provides to a major part of the Northern Hemisphere. Masses of mountains shield Siberia against the warm air from the west and south, while in the opposite direction, the door to the Artic stands wide open.  Thus in the winter, cold masses of air expand into the Siberian landscape completely unrestricted.\n\nThe average temperature in winter: Minus 40¬∞ Celsius. The children of the Siberian Oimjakon have the world`s coldest way to school. The extreme living conditions are completely normal for the residents of Oymyakon. This is also true for the Tariks family and their son Aljosha. He is 8 years old. The children of his age group are only excused from attending school on account of the cold at temperatures below minus 54¬∞ degrees.  \n\nEven before his departure for school Aljosha feels the grim cold. Lacking running water the house also has no bathroom. So Aljosha alredy has to go outside ‚Äì to the unheated outside earth closet in the garden. Sascha‚Äôs mother cooks tea. In order to do so, she must go to outside to the front of the house, which is made of wood- as all houses in Oymyakon. Due to the great temperature differences here, concrete walls would soon crack and be destroyed. In the short summers, it can get quite warm in Oymyakon. In front of the wooden house the ice blocks are stored.  The next-door farmer had cut out of the frozen river for them. There is no running water in the Pole of Cold, with temperatures dropping to -65 degrees Celsius; no pipe work has a chance. Aljoshas mother puts the ice in the pot and cooks some tea for her son. \n\nLike every day, Aljosha must get ready to go to school. Like the majority of the other students, Sascha wears for the most part his traditional dress. The clothing prescribes to the onion-peel principle in order to protect the students from the Artic temperatures. His mother Irina has heated up the living room to 20¬∞ degrees. So when Aljosha opens the front door it is 70¬∞ degrees colder ‚Äì every day life in Oimjakon. As soon as the children open the dormitory‚Äôs double doors, the icy cold brutally grabs hold of them. Within less than one second their nostrils become frozen. \n\nUnlike the students in other parts of the world, the children from Oymyakon are seldom playful but instead very concentrated on their way to school. With quick steps, they travel in groups, attempting to put the 2 kilometer route behind them as quickly as possible. There are no signs of snow ball fights. The don‚Äôt spend a second of time watching the cows, which are kept up to nine months of the year in their stalls, and are now coincidentally being lead out of the barn for a drink. Even though the cows are wearing some sort of special ‚Äúbras‚Äù which protect their udders from freezing. \n\nOnce in school building, Aljosha and the other students remove many of their layers of clothing, and get going with the school lessons. For the majority of them, a welcome diversion from the coldest inhabited town on the earth.",
