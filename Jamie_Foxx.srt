178
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:28,280
So, I was like,

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,482
"That's weird as hell. I don't know what that means."

180
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:33,752
But he just busts in my house, and he goes into my closet

181
00:07:33,752 --> 00:07:35,554
and starts picking out clothes

182
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,757
and, like, putting out clothes and stuff.

183
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,025
I was like, "This is crazy.

185
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,195
And then this little girl came in, and she was like,

186
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:45,731
"Oh, my God! Bobby! Oh, my God! I love you!

187
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,633

He says, "Really? Let me hear it."

189
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,271
She said, "Oh, I didn't get you. I only got Whitney."

190
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,741
And that didn't go over too --

191
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,043
That didn't go over too well. Right?

192
00:07:58,043 --> 00:08:00,479
So, after I calmed Bobby down, I said,

193
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,180
"Bobby just calm down. Just get more clothes."

194
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,483
So he got the clothes.

195
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,852

I'm serious. Check the history.

351
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:41,887
It was actually called "Hood."

352
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,856
It's nothing like the Robin Hood you think.

353
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,657
It ain't no tights, nothing like that.

354
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:46,692
We going off in there.

355
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:47,726
-You don't wear tights?

356
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:48,827
-No. I don't wear --

357
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:50,429
I have on tights now, but we don't --

358
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,530
No, I don't wear tights.

359
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,365
-They're bummed out a little bit. Yeah.

360
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,234
-No, no, I can't. Not with these calves.

361
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,801
[ Laughter ]

362
00:13:56,801 --> 00:13:59,637
'Cause you know, brothers don't have -- brothers don't have --

363
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:02,908
I don't do calves. I don't do legs.

364
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,778
Brothers just -- I just bench press.

365
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,947
[ Laughter ]

366
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,849
I've never seen brothers doing legs in the gym.

367
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:14,553
It's all...

368
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,387
It's like jailhouse.

369
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:17,522
-Then the white dude?

370
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:19,791
-Yeah, yeah, the white dude. [ Laughter ]

371
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,660
-Ain't doing that. -You know what I'm saying?

372
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,262
I'd be like, "Man, I ain't doing all that."

373
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,263
[ Laughter ]

374
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:28,934
My legs are so tiny, I don't even wear -- I wear shants.

375
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,736
[ Laughter ]

376
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,671
You know how they come all the way down to here,

377
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:36,208
and then there's socks and just a little bit of meat.

378
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,610
[ Laughter ]

379
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,512
A little bit of meat. I have on shants.

380
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:41,846
'Cause I don't have calf muscles.

381
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,549
It's like I could beat you up, but I can't chase you.

382
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:49,722
[ Laughter ]

383
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,190
You take off, I'm like, "I'll catch up."

384
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,227
-You and Taron Egerton, who is --

385
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,661
Man, oh, man, this is a talented guy.

386
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:58,097
The last time he was on the show,

387
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,065
I remember, I made him sing.

388
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,867
He's got a beautiful voice.

389
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,135
Talented kid.

390
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,070
-He's incredible, and that's what's great about this.

391
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,405
It's a new, fresh take on it.

392
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,206
Leonardo DiCaprio is producer on it.

393
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,541
Otto Bathurst is director.

394
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,843
So Thanksgiving, you all come please, check it out.

395
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:14,079
-It's a family movie, but it's got some action.

396
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,114
It's for everybody. I want to show a clip.

397
00:15:16,114 --> 00:15:19,084
He's Jamie Foxx and Taron Egerton in "Robin Hood."

398
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,252
Take a look at this.

399
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,121
-I can fire two arrows a second. -Yeah.

400
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:26,824
-You could fire two arrows a second.

401
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:28,661
-You think you're faster?

402
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:33,331
Shoot me.

403
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:37,236
-Beg your pardon? -You've killed hundreds of us.

404
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,805
What's one more?

405
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,573
-Okay.

406
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:49,048
-Please. I said shoot me!

407
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,215
Too slow!

408
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,017
Fast as you can!

409
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:54,086
Again! Come on, English!

410
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,528
Again.

411
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,100
Too slow.

412
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,868
-Yeah! [ Cheers and applause ]

413
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,705
Jamie Foxx, everybody!
